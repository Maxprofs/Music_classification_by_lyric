                        Bài hát: Battleborne - Two Steps From Hell

Oh
There is fire in the air that I'm breathing
There is blood where the battles rage
These are faces I will not remember
Will I fight for the Queen or the slave?
A treacherous part to play with our heart of courage
Where the wind from the north blows the dragon
And the armies and legions have fought
We have camp for the night, for the cover
Fading ghosts in the shadows of war

Battleborn
Battleborn
Battleborn
Battleborn

Gone
are the villagers, lead out of pasture
The black wing of death as their leech
Felt the ground, it was bare from the plunder
Soldiers that lie at my feet
The maidens were lost wading across an ocean
On a ship heading south to the mainland
I am standing in wait of the storm
I was raised by the wolf and the stallion
This sword was battleborn

Battleborn
Battleborn
Battleborn
Battleborn
                        
                    |
