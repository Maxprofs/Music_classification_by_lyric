                        Bài hát: Hey Baby (Drop It To The Floor) - Pitbull, T-Pain

Mr. Worldwide
So listen up

Let it go
La, la, la

If your girl wanna play, let her go, so let her go
(La, la, la)
If your girl wanna play, let her go, so let her go
(La, la, la)

If your girl wanna play, let her go, so let her go
(La, la, la)
If your girl wanna play, let her go

Hey baby girl, what you doin' tonight?
I wanna see what you got in store
Hey baby, givin' it your all when you're dancin' on me
I wanna see if you give me some more

Hey baby, you can be my girl, I can be your man
And we can pump this jam however you want
Hey baby, pump it from the side, bend it upside down
Or we can pump it from the back to the front

Hey baby
Ooh baby, baby, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
Ooh baby, baby, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
Ooh baby, baby, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
Ooh baby, baby, la, la, la, la, la, la, la

Ooh, drop it to the floor, make you wanna say it
Yeah, you can shake some more, make you wanna sing it
Ooh, you got it because you make me wanna say, hey baby
Don't stop it, I want you tonight

I'm a Dade County
Self-paid, self-made millionaire
I used to play around the world
Now I'm around the world, gettin' paid

Girl problems, no problems
Don't hate the game, that won't solve 'em
I wanna get wit' ya, mami
Now let me see where the lord split ya

Hey baby girl, what you doin' tonight?
I wanna see what you got in store
Hey baby, givin' it you all when you're dancin' on me
I wanna see if you can give me some more

Hey baby, you can be my girl I can be your man

And we can pump this jam however you want
Hey baby, pump it from the side bend it upside down
Or we can pump it from the back to the front
