                        Bài hát: All These Years - Camila Cabello

[Verse 1]
Your hair's grown a little longer
Your arms look a little stronger
Your eyes just as I remember (oh)
Your smile's just a little softer

[Pre-Chorus]
And I, yeah, I never prepared for a moment like that
Yeah, suddenly, it all came back, it all came back

[Chorus]
'Cause after all these years
I still feel everything when you are near
And it was just a quick "Hello," and you had to go
And you probably will never know
You're still the one I'm after all these years
(Oh yeah)

[Verse 2]
Couldn't help but overhear you
Sounds like you're happy with her
But does she kiss you like I kissed you?
Ooh, I wish I loved you like I miss you

[Pre-Chorus]
And I, yeah, I never prepared for a moment like that
Yeah, suddenly, it all came back, it all came back

[Chorus]
'Cause after all these years
I still feel everything when you are near
And it was just a quick "Hello," and you had to go
And you probably will never know
You're still the one I'm after all these years, oh
'Cause after all these years
I still feel everything when you are near (you are near)
And it was just a quick "Hello," and you had to go (ooh)
And you probably will never know (oh)
You're still the one I'm after all these years

[Bridge]
I never told you, I should've told you
I never told you after all these years

[Outro]
Told you, I never told you (told you)
Told you, I never told you
I never told you after all these years
                        
                    |
