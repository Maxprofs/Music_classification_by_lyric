                        Don't lose your way

With each passing day

You're come so far

Don't throw it away



Live believing

Dreams are for wearing

Wonders are waiting to start



Live your story,

Faith,hope and glory

Hold to the truth in your heart



Chorus :

If we hold on together

I know our dreams will never die

Dreams see us through to forever

When clouds roll by

For you and I



Souls in the wind

must learn how to bend

Seek out a star

Hold on till the end



Valley, mountain,

There is a fountain

Washes our tears all away



Words are swaying,

Someone is praying

Please let us come home to stay



[Chorus]



When we are out there in the dark

We'll dream about the sun

In the dark we'll feel the light

Warm our hearts, everyone



If we hold on together

I know our dreams

Will never die

Dreams see us through to forever

As high as souls can fly

The clouds roll by

For you and....I
                        
                    |
