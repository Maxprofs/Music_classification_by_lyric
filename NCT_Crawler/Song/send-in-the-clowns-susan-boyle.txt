Artist: Susan Boyle 
Albums: Standing Ovation: The Greatest Songs From The Stage

Isn't it rich?

Are we a pair?

Me here at last on the ground,
You in mid-air..

Send in the clowns.

Isn't it bliss?

Don't you approve?

One who keeps tearing around,
One who can't move...

Where are the clowns?

Send in the clowns.

Just when I'd stopped opening doors,
Finally knowing the one
that I wanted was yours.

Making my entrance
again with my usual flair

Sure of my lines...

No one is there.

Don't you love farce?

My fault, I fear.

I thought that you'd want what I want...
Sorry, my dear!

And where are the clowns

There are to be the clowns
quick,send in the clowns

what a surprise who could foresee
I'd come to feel about you
What you felt about me?

Why only now when I see
That you've drifted away?

What a surprise...

What a cliche...

isn't it rich,isn't it queer

losing my timing this late is my career

and where are the clowns

quick send in the clowns

don't bother, they're here
