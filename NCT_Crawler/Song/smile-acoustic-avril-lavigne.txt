                        You know that I’m a crazy bitch
I do what I want, when I feel like it
All I wanna do is lose control
But you don’t really give a *
Ya go with it, go with it, go with it
‘Cause you’re *in’ crazy
Rock n’ roll

You-ou said “hey
What’s your name?”
It took one look and
Now I’m not the same.

Yeah, you said “Hey”
And since that day,
You stole my heart and you’re the one to blame

Yeah

[chorus]
And that’s why I smile.
It’s been a while
Since everyday and everything has felt this right
And now
You turn it all around
And suddenly you’re all I need
The reason why,
I-i-i, I smi-i-i-ile.

Last night I blacked out, I think.
What did you, what did you put in my drink?
I remember making out and then
Oh oh
I Woke up with a new tattoo
Your name was on me and my name was on you.
I would do it all over again

You-ou said “hey (hey)

What’s your name?” (what’s your name?)
It took one look and
Now I’m not the same.

Yeah, you said “Hey” (hey)
And since that day, (since that day)
You stole my heart and you’re the one to blame

[chorus]
And that’s why I smile.
It’s been a while
Since everyday and everything has felt this right
And now
You turn it all around
And suddenly you’re all I need
The reason why,
I-i-i, I smi-i-i-ile.
The reason why,
I-i-i, I smi-i-i-ile.

You know that I’m a crazy bitch
I do what I want, when I feel like it
All I wanna do is lose control
You know that I’m a crazy bitch
I do what I want, when I feel like it
All I wanna do is lose control

[chorus]
And that’s why I smile.
It’s been a while
Since everyday and everything has felt this right
And now
You turn it all around
And suddenly you’re all I need
The reason why,
I-i-i, I smi-i-i-ile.
The reason why,
I-i-i, I smi-i-i-ile
                        
                    |
