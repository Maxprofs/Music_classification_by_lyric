                        No one told me about he
The way she lied
Well, no one told me about he
How many people cried
Well, it's too late to say you're so
y
How would I know, why should I care
Please don't bother trying to find he
She's not there...oh oh oh
Nobody told me about he
What could I do
Well, nobody told me about he
Though they all knew
Well, it's too late to say you're so
y
How would I know, why should I care
Please don't bother trying to find he
She's not there....
Well, let me tell you about the way she looked
The way she acted, the color of her hai
Her voice is soft and cool
Her eyes are clear and 
ight
But she's not there...
