                        Fly by

All dressed up you\'re good to go
Checkin your style from head to toe
Hooked up and natural
You\'re feelin beautiful
9 times out of 10 you know
Late night club like a video with the
Hot stuff - top stuff - we got stuff oh

What a night (night)
So far (far)
Pullin up curb side in your car (your car)
What a sight (sight)
You are (are)
Think I know somewhere we can park
After dark

Chorus:
System up with the top down
Got the city on lockdown
Drive by in the low ride
Hands high when we fly by

System up with the top down
Got the city on lockdown
Drive by in the low ride
Hands high when we fly by
Fly by, fly by, fly by, fly by

Girl it\'s time to let you know
I\'m down if you wanna go
We can take it nice and slow
We got until tomorrow
UK style UK flow
We got you hot like Whoa
With the hot stuff - top stuff - we got stuff

What a night (night)
So far (far)
Pullin up curb side in your car (your car)
What a sight (sight)
You are (are)
Think I know somewhere we can park
After dark

Chorus...

I\'ll tell you this for a fact, fact
A lot of ladies step up on a fat track
Leave ya fella in the corner
With his starter cap,
Show him how to act
Show me love
Where you at?

What a night
So far
Pullin up curb side in your car
What a sight
You are
Think I know somewhere we can park
After dark
                        
                    |
