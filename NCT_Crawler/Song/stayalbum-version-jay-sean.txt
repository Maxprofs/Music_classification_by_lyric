                        You said it once
 Said it twice
 Said it hurts but I do it again
 I don't change, I don't learn
 Cause I can't let it end
 Said it's gone
 Let it be, cause you don't need a friend
 Maybe I do
 I pull and you push
 And we cry till we laugh again and I
 I promise you
 You promise me back and then
 Why does it all fall apart in just a matter of time

 So I'm thinking maybe you've made up your mind
 Cause you're distant (distant)
 And I can't stand to fight no more
 So please don't make me hurt you like I do
 I don't really trust myself to leave
 Even though I hear you sayin' baby, no, no

 No no no no no no no
 I can't take no more of this and
 I'm knock, knock, knockin' on your door
 Asking if you still let me in
 Won't you stay-ay-ay-ay-ay
 Ay-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay
 Won't you stay-ay-ay-ay
 Won't you stay

 Memories of the fun that we had are photographs on the wall
 Now I can't make you smile or hear you laugh anymore
 And I can't help but ask, what's the point of it all
 Tell me baby
 Call it love, call it blame, call it joy, call it pain
 But I fell, call it girl what you may
 But as painfull as hell
 To be here while you're there
 Don't need nobody else

 So I'm thinking maybe you've made up your mind
 Cause you're distant (distant)
 And I can't stand to fight no more
 So please don't make me hurt you like I do
 I don't really trust myself to leave
 Even though you're tellin' me no, no

 No no no no no no no
 I can't take no more of this and
 I'm knock, knock, knockin' on your door
 Asking if you still let me in
 Won't you stay-ay-ay-ay-ay
 Ay-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay
 Won't you stay-ay-ay-ay
 Won't you stay

 If you're so meant for me, and if I'm so meant for you
 Why does this have to be so hard on both of us two?
 If you're so meant for me, and if I'm so meant for you
 Why does this have to be so hard on both of us two?

 Still you're sayin'
 No no no no no no no
 I can't take no more of this and
 I'm knock, knock, knockin' on your door
 Asking if you still let me in
 Won't you stay-ay-ay-ay-ay
 Ay-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay
 Won't you stay-ay-ay-ay
 Won't you stay

 Won't you stay-ay-ay-ay-ay
 Ay-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay
 Stay-ay-ay-ay
 Won't you stay
