Enya:My! My! Time Flies!
My! My! Time Flies!
One step and we're on the moon
Next step into the stars
My! My! Time flies!
Maybe we could be there soon
A one way ticket to mars

My! My! Time Flies!
A man underneath a tree
An apple falls on his head
My! My! Time Flies!
A man wrote a symphony
It's 1812

My! My! Time Flies!
Four guys across Abbey Road
One forgot to wear shoes
My! My! Time Flies!
A rap on a rhapsody
A king who's still in the news
A king to sing you the blues

My! My! Time flies!
A man in a winter sleigh
White white white as the snow
My! My! Time flies!
A new day is on its way
So let's let yesterday go
Could be we step out again
Could be tomorrow but then
Could be 2010
Enya:My! My! Time Flies!
