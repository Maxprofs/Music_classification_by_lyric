 And a whole bunch of buckets with a whole bunch of lights on 'em

 With a dream full of F-I-N-ER things
 On the scheme for the green, if you know what I mean
 Put your bottles in the air, let me hear em ting, ting
 Ching, ching little rockstar lifestyle, just like Sting
 Chick is a rockstar, just like Pink
 Talking bout cake, where the *** icing?
 Heard you looking for the man, bitch nigga ice him
 Bout to make a play, never sitting on the bench
 Your girl trynna ***, what she fresh out the pen?
 Not just me but the whole team in it
 I'ma take the shot but the whole team winning
 Bucket full of roses, Rose swirl
 Blunt full of killa, OG hitta
 Bat Gang thats my nigga my niggas
 Alumni you can see I'm bout my business
 I might talk a lil but don't need no help
 But I never could've made it here by my self
 Never gonna change, so day one with em
