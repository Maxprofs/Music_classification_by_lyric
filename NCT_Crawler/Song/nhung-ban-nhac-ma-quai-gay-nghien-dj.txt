(Ph rase 1)
Hello, Salute, It's me, Your Duke
And I made something thats real to show you alrivee
Hello, Heelloo, It's me, Picasso
I will play (beep) My words of love, with your name on every one.

(Chorus)
When you leave my calla frase to graa
Ooo-a-Ooo-a-A-O oo-a-Ooo-a-Ooo-a-A
E very words of love I use to say.
Now I beg to death everyday.
when you leave my calla frase to graa
don't leave another stain, the roboa colors fade away
Every words of love I use to say.
Now I beg to death everyday.

(phrase 2)
I saw, my streams, my song and dreams
and I brought something to match the colors of my love.
Hello, Helloo, It's me again, Picasso. I will spread, the words of love with your name on every one.
                        
                    |
