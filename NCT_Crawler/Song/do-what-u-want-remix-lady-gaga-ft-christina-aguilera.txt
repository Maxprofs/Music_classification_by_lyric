                        Bài hát: Do What U Want (Remix) - Lady Gaga, Christina Aguilera

I feel good, I walk alone
But then I trip by myself and I fall
I, I stand up, and then I'm okay
But then you break that sh*t
That makes me want to scream


So do what you want
What you want with my body
Do what you want
Don't stop, let's party
Do what you want
What you want with my body
Do what you want
What you want with my body


Write what you want
Say what you want bout me
If you’re wanna
Know that I’m not sorry


Do what you want
What you want with my body
What you want with my body


You can’t have my heart
And you won't use my mind but
Do what you want (with my body)
Do what you want with my body
You can’t stop my voice cause
You dont own my life but
Do what you want (with my body)
Do what you want (with my body)


My bones hurt, from all the shows
But I don't feel the pain cause I'm pro
I, sink in, then I'm okay
Cause my body belongs
To you when I'm on stage


So do what I want
What you want with my body
Do what I want
Don't stop, let's party
Do what I want
What you want with my body
Do what I want
What you want with my body


Write what you want
Say what you want 'bout me
If you wanna know that I'm not sorry


Do what you want with my body
What you want with my body


You can’t have my heart
And you won't use my mind but
Do what you want (with my body)
Do what you want with my body
You can’t stop my voice cause
You dont own my life but
Do what you want (with my body)
Do what you want (with my body)


Sometimes I'm scared I suppose
If you ever let me go
I would fall apart
If you break my heart
So just take my body
And don't stop the party


You can’t have my heart
And you won't use my mind but
Do what you want (with my body)
Do what you want with my body
You can’t stop my voice cause
You dont own my life but
Do what you want (with my body)
Do what you want (with my body)


Do what you want with me
What you want with Lady Gaga
What you want with Christina
What you want with my body
Do what you want with me
What you want with my body
Do what you want with me


What you want with my body world!
What you want with my body world!.....
