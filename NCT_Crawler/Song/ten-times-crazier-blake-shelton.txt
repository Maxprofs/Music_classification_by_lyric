                        Bài hát: Ten Times Crazier - Blake Shelton 

Well I'm crazy about fast cars, football and guitars
All them old country songs daddy used to play
I'm crazy about Friday nights, cold beer and good times
Crazy about a summer day out on the lake
But I'm ten times crazier about your loving girl
I'd do about anything you'd ask me to
I'm just plain crazy about a lot of things baby
But I'm ten times crazier about you

Well I'm all about a weekend kickin' with my good friends
Every now and then I like to make a little noise
But don't you go thinking that I won't leave em hanging
Cause even though I'm crazy about them good ol' boys
I'm ten times crazier about your loving girl
I'd do about anything you'd ask me to
I'm just plain crazy about a lot of things baby
But I'm ten times crazier about you

I know you love me girl thats easy to see
But as crazy as you say you are about me
I'm ten times crazier about your loving girl
I'd do about anything you'd ask me to
I'm just plain crazy about a lot of things baby
But I'm ten times crazier about you
I'm ten times crazier about your loving girl
I'd do about anything you'd ask me to
I'm just plain crazy about a lot of things baby
But I'm ten times crazier about you
