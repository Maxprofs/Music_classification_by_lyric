Âu Mỹ khác|

                        It's hard to believe 
That i couldn't see that 
You were always there beside me 
Thought i was alone with no one to hold 
You were always right beside me 
This feeling's like no others 
I want you to know 
I've never had someone as knows me like you do 
The way you do 
I've never had someone is good for me as you no one like you 
So lonely before i finally found what i've been looking for.
