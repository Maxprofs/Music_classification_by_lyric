                        Aint No Sunshine - Olivia Ong

Ain't no sunshine when he's gone 
It's not warm when he's away. 
Ain't no sunshine when he's gone 
And he's always gone too long 
Anytime he goes away. 

Wonder this time where he's gone 
Wonder if he's gone to stay 
Ain't no sunshine when he's gone 
And this house just ain't no home 
Anytime he goes away. 

And I know, I know, I know, I know, 
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, 
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, 
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, 
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, 
I know, I know, 
Hey, I oughtta leave young thing alone 
But ain't no sunshine when she's gone 

Ain't no sunshine when he's gone 
Only darkness every day. 
Ain't no sunshine when he's gone 
And this house just ain't no home 
Anytime he goes away. 
Anytime he goes away. 
Anytime he goes away. 
Anytime he goes away.
