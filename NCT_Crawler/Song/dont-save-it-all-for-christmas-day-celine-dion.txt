                        Don't get so busy that you miss 
Giving just a little kiss 
To the ones you love 

Don't even wait a little while 
To give them just a little smile 
A little is enough 

How many people are crying 
People are dying? 
How many people are asking for love? 

[Chorus:] 
So don't save it all for Christmas day 
Find your way to give a little love everyday 
Don't save it all for Christmas day 
Find your way 'cause holidays have come and gone 
But love lives on if you give on love 

How could you wait another minute? 
A hug is warmer when you're in it 
And baby that's a fact 

And saying "I love you" is always better 
Seasons, reasons, they don't matter 
So don't hold back 

How many people in this world 
So needful in this world? 
How many people are praying for love? 

(Chorus) 

Let all the children know 
Everywhere that they go 
And their whole life long 
Let them know love 

(Chorus)
                        
                    |
