                        Bài hát: Itsuka No Zero Kara - Angela

Donna ni Girigiri drive Fuman ge na kao no nai chaos
Jyoukei dake ga hora Joudan meite what a amazing

Tsumanai It's rainy day because
Hane ga omoku natte You cannot fly
Dekiru toko made Aruite oide yo

Itsuka kanashii hajimari mo Kie use zero ni natte
Kumo no kanata no uchuu ni... tokete ikundarou
Utsuroi yasui kokoro nara Nando datte yareru sa
Start line ni tatsu sube wo shitteru tte
Buretesou de tsuyoi

Doushite? Harahara eyes kugen ni press sareru nante rashikunai
Fifty/fifty? Dead or love? "Ima" wo okasu kenri wa nai

Soukaikan naki yoru wo Hiyasubeku ame ga furu
Houshin shite mo shinakute mo Tomorrow will come

Itsuka kanashii hajimari mo Kie use zero ni natte
Kumo no kanata no uchuu ni... tokete ikundarou
Kuyashisa no stage de odoreba Takumashiku nareru sa
Terasareta honnou sae Kiwadatsu oora

Itsuka otona to yobarete Ironna mono wo seoitte
Yume no kanata datta basho ni Genmetsu shitatte 
"Utsukushii" de nurikatamete Uwabetori tsukurutte mo
Doro darake de mo Kusubutte mo
Kagayakeru honou Te ni shitai




How much a last minute drive 
is a dissatisfied faceless chaos
Look! It's only a big talk
being appointed as a joke
what a amazing

It does not load
it's rainy day because
Your feathers became heavy
you cannot fly
Do it like this until you
come over walking

Someday even a sad beginning disappears and becomes zero
Clouds in the far side of the universe... will melt
If it is the heart that changes easily,
it can do so many times.
It is to know the way which stands on a starting line.
It blurs and is that strong.

Why? Eyes in great fear
There is no fence being pressed in candid advice
50/50? DEAD OR LOVE?
There is no right to commit "now"

It rains in order to cool the night without invigoration
Even if I'm absentminded 
Even if it does not carry out
Tomorrow will come

Someday even a sad beginning disappears and becomes zero
Clouds in the far side of the universe will melt
If dancing on the stage of regret can become brawny
Even illuminated instincts are outstanding aura

Someday being called an adult carries various things on the back
Dreams at the far side of the place 
are being free from illusions
Coating "it's beautiful" on the temporising surface
Even when it is muddy
Even if it smoulders
I want to obtain the shining flame
                        
                    |
