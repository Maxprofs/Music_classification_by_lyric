Misery Lyrics
Good Charlotte

Take a look around
Don't you see it
See that you are the only real face in the room
No one here has a clue what your feelin'
Don't feel bad
Keep your sadness alive

Look at all these happy people
Living their lives
Look at all these plastic people
There's nothing inside
Look at all these shallow people
Telling their lies
Look at all these empty people, people

Don’t you know
The Misery loves company
Yeah I heard
The Misery was looking for me
Happiness, is a face that don't look good on me
Yeah I heard
The Misery comes looking for me
Whoa, misery's my company
Whoa, misery is looking for me
Looking for me

The hands are up now
Everybody's singin'
Everybody’s movin’
They program their feelings
They're syncronizing,
And criticizing
Don't feel bad
Keep your sadness alive

Look at all these happy people
Living their lives
Look at all these plastic people
They're dying inside
Look at all these shallow people
Telling their lies
Look at all these empty people, people

Don't you know
The misery loves company
Yeah I heard
The misery was looking for me
Happiness, is a face that don't look good on me
Yeah I heard
The Misery comes looking for me
Whoa, misery's my company
Whoa, misery is looking for me

Don't you know this misery loves me
Don't you know this misery loves me
Don't you know this misery loves me
Don't you know this misery loves me
Loves me

So you're tired of runnin'
You're tired of hurting
You're tired of living in their lies
You're tired of listening
You're tired of hurting
Keep your sadness alive, alive

Don't you know
The misery loves company
Yeah I heard
The misery was looking for me
Happiness, is a face that don't look good on me
Yeah I heard
The misery comes looking for me
Don't you know
Misery loves company
Yeah I heard
The misery was looking for me
Happiness,is a face that don't look good on me
Yeah I heard
The misery comes looking for me

Whoa, misery's my company
Whoa, misery is looking for me
                        
                    |
