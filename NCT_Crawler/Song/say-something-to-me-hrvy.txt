                        Bài hát: Say Something To Me - HRVY

[Music]
She has a way
But she hop on me whenever she walks by, ah yeah
Swear it's an accident
But everynow I'm then i think she, her smile, ah yeah

It is my imagination 
What I'm reading between the lines, ah yeah
And I don't know if she playing
But I ain't the one full wasting time, ah yeah

And I don't know
If she just fly'in, ain't no play'in
                        
                    |
