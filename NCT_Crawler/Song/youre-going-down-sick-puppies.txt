                        Define your meaning of war
To me it's what we do when we're bored
I feel that heat coming off of the blacktop
And it makes me want it more
Because I'm hyped up, outta control
If it's a fight I'm ready to go
I wouldn't put my money on the other guy
If you know what I already know

It's been a long time coming
And the tables' turned around
Cause one of us is going
One of us is going down
I'm not running, it's a little different now
Cause one of us is going
ONE OF US IS GOING DOWN !!!

Define your meaning of fun
To me it's when we're getting done
I feel the heat coming off of the blacktop
So get ready for another one
Let's take a trip down memory lane
The words circulate in my brain
You can treat this like another all I'm saving
But don't cry like a bitch when you feel the pain

It's been a long time coming
And the tables' turned around
Cause one of us is going
One of us is going down
I'm not running, it's a little different now
Cause one of us is going
ONE OF US IS GOING DOWN !!!

This is hardly worth fighting for
But it's the little petty * that I can't ignore
With my fist in your face and your face on the floor
It will be a long time coming
But you got the message now
Cause I was never going
Yeah, you're the one that's going down !!

One of us is going down
I'm not running, it's a little different now
Cause one of us is going
ONE OF US IS GOING DOWN !!!
