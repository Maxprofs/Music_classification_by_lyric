                        Bài hát: What'S My Name (From "Descendants 2") - China Anne McClain, Thomas Doherty, Dylan Playfair

This is all hands on deck
Calling out to lost boys and girls
I'm gettin' tired of the disrespect
We won't stop 'til we rule the world! 

It's our time, we up next! (next)
Our sail's about to be set (set)
They ain't seen nothing yet!
Tell 'em who's in charge so they don't forget

What's my name? What's my name? (Uma)
Say it louder!
What's my name? What's my name? (Uma)
Feel the power!

No one's gonna stop us
Soon the world will be ours

What's my name? What's my name? 
What's it? What's it? 
Say it loud! 

(Uuuuma)

All eyes on me
Let me see 'em!

What's it? What's it? 
Say it! Say it! 

(Uuuuma)

I'm the queen of this town
I call the shots, you know who I am
I don't need to wear no fake crown
Stand up to me, you don't stand a chance

It's our time, we up next! (next)
My crew's as real as it gets (gets)
The worst is now the best
And leaving us here will be their last regret!

What's my name? What's my name? (Uma)
Say it louder!
What's my name? What's my name? (Uma)
Feel the power!

No one's gonna stop us
Soon the world will be ours! 

What's my name? What's my name? 
What's it? What's it? 
Say it! Say it! 

You know what they say
Bad girls have all the fun
Never learned to count
'Cause I'm number one

Ready here we come
We always get out way
It's a pirate's life
Every single day

(Hey!)

She's the captain
I'm the first mate
Enemies seasick
Can't see straight

Call 'em fish bait
Throw 'em on a hook
Uma's so hot
They get burned if they look

All eyes on me
Let me see 'em!

I see your eyes on me, boys
 (hey!)
You know what my name is
Say it! 
Say it louder!

(Hook me!)

Haha
Hahaha...
Come on 

What's my name? What's my name? (Uma)
Say it louder!
What's my name? What's my name?(Uma)
Feel the power!

No one's gonna stop us
Soon the world will be ours! 

What's my name? What's my name? 

(Uuuuuma)

All eyes on me
Let me see 'em!

What's it? What's it? 
Say it! Say it! 

Ooh, say it louder!
Ooh, say it louder!

What's it? What's it? 
Say it! Say it!
                        
                    |
