                        Tear me down
 Tell me I don't need to fear
 Tell me now
 Tell me some bodies near
 'Cause sirens
 Sirens are all I hear They keep calling out
 Calling out someone's name
 Keep calling out
 And all you can do is pray
 That these sirens
 Sirens don't come our way Or we'll be
 All run run running away
 We'll be
 All run run running away
 All run run running away
 When sirens they come our way It's raining now
 Raining on someone's fears
 Raining down
 I've heard the rain is the city's tears
 But these sirens
 These sirens are all I hear And they keep calling out
 Calling out someone's name
 Keep calling out
 And all I can do is pray
 That these sirens
 Sirens don't come our way Or we'll be
 All run run running away
 We'll be
 All run run running away
 All run run running away
 When sirens they come our way
                        
                    |
