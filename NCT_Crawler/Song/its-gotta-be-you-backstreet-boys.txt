Baby it's the way you make me
Kinda get me go crazy
Never wanna stop
It's gotta be you(uh huh, uh huh)
I can't control it any more
I've never felt like this before
Mmm, you really make me lose my head
My hungry heart must be fed(uh huh, uh huh)
Baby it's the way you make me
Kinda get me go crazy
Never wanna stop
It's gotta be you(uh huh, uh huh)
All the way
It's gotta be you(uh huh, uh huh)
Everyday
I promise you I will be true, yeah
It's only you
Now I know why I was born
You feel my feelings one by one
Can't see the world I'm walking through
'Cause baby I see only you, oh yeah
Baby it's the way you make me
Kinda get me go crazy
Never wanna stop
It's gotta be you(uh huh, uh huh)
All the way
It's gotta be you(uh huh, uh huh)
Everyday
I promise you I will be true, yeah
It's only you
And you know
I can't see the world I'm walking through
'Cause of you, yeah...
It's gotta be you, all the way
All that I ever wanted
It's gotta be you, I will be true, yeah
It's only you
It's gotta be you, all the way
It's gotta be you
All that I ever wanted
It's gotta be you, I will be true, yeah
It's only you
Baby it's only you
I promise you I will be true, yeah
It's only you
