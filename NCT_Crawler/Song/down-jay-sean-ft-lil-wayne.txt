                        Baby are you down? [x5]
Down, down
Even if the sky is fallin' down
Down, down (oh)

You already know
Tonight is the night to let it go
Put on a show (show, show)
I wanna see how you lose control
So leave it behind, cause we have a night to get away (away, away)
So come on and fly with me
As we make our great escape (escape, escape)

Chorus:
So baby don't worry
You are my only
You won't be lonely
Even if the sky is falling down
You'll be my only
No need to worry
Baby are you down? [x5]
Down, down
Baby are you down? [x5]
Down, down
Even if the sky is falling down

Just let it be
Come on and bring your body next to me
I'll take you away (ay)
Turn this place into our private getaway
So leave it behind, cause we have a night to get away (away, away)
So come on and fly with me
As we make our great escape
So why don't we run away

(Chorus)

[Lil Wayne:]
Down like she's suppose to be
She gets down all over me
Down like her temperature
Cause to me she's zero degrees
She's cold, over freeze
I got that girl from over seas
Now she's my Miss America
Now can i be her soldier, please?
I'm fighting for this girl on the battlefield of love
Got me look like baby Cupid
Sending arrows from above
Don't you ever leave the side of me
And waiting definitely, not probably
And honestly I'm down like that economy (Yeah)

(Chorus)

Even if the sky is falling down
Oh, oh, the sky is falling down
                        
                    |
