                        She said, she said, "You don't know ***
 Because you've never been there"
 She turned upon him
 Took him by the hair Spun him 'round about
 Laughing as he fell about
 Sat down for a drink
 In her father's favorite chair Kill your television I said, "I know I don't ***
 Because I've never been there"
 You turn upon me
 Took me by the hair Spun me 'round about, pushing me out
 Laughing as I fell about
 Sat down for a drink
 In your father's favorite chair She said Soap for sore eyes
 I need an intermission
 If looks could kill
 I'd kill your television Soap for sore eyes
 I need an intermission
 If looks could kill
 I'd kill your television Kill your television Soap for sore eyes
