                        Bài hát : What I Believe - Skillet

The world around me is lost in misery
The only good i've got in my life is you
No meaning..
No other reason ...
When everything feels wrong 
I feel right with you..

(Jen Ledger):
So madly
Desperate deeply
Obsessed your love
Is better than life to me
Can i have this moment forever

(Jonh):
Take me, to the beginning


You're what i believe
I'll live and die for you
This is all that i need 
When nothing is real
You're my truth....

(Jen Ledger) :
In the darkness you shine
Can you keep me safe tonight

When i'm down on my kness 
You're what i believe........
..........................................................
When we started wholehearted
I never needed anything or anyone else
I was broken
You make me whole again
The only one i trusted more than myself 
(Jen Ledger):
So madly
Desperate deeply
I will live for you completely
Can i have this moment forever
(jonh):
Take me, to the beginning


You're what i believe
I'll live and die for you
This is all that i need 
When nothing is real
You're my truth....
(Jen Ledger) :
In the darkness you shine
Can you keep me safe tonight

When i'm down on my kness 
You're what i believe........

Believe your love
believe your life
Believe that you can put me 
back together on the inside 
Chase all the fear away
Every i speak your name 

Take me you are what i believe...

You're what i believe
I'll live and die for you
This is all that i need 
When nothing is real
You're my truth....

In the darkness you shine
Can you keep me safe tonight

When i'm down on my kness 
You're what i believe........
                        
                    |
