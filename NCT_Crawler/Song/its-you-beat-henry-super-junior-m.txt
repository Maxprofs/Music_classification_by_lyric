                        Bài hát: It's You Beat - Henry (Super Junior-M)

Baby I’m falling Head over heels
Looking for ways to
let you know just how I feel
Wish I was holding You by my side
I wouldn’t change a thing
cause finally it’s real

Tryna hold back
You oughta know that
You’re the one that’s on my mind
I’m falling too fast Deeply in love
Finding the magic
in the colors of you

You’re the right time
at the right moment
You’re the sunlight
keeps my heart going
know when I’m with you
Can’t keep myself from falling
right time at the right moment
It’s you
you it’s you
you it’s you

Baby I’m falling Deeper in love
Everything that you are is
all I’m dreaming of
And if I can break enough
to show you that I need us
I’d give up everything
I have girl just for you

Tryna hold back
You oughta know that
You’re the one that’s on my mind
I’m falling too fast Deeply in love
Girl all I need to breathe is you

Cause you’re the right time
at the right moment
you’re the sunlight
keeps my heart going
know when i’m with you
Can’t keep myself from falling
right time at the right moment
it’s you

Every night in my bed I’m dreaming
That it’s you in my arms I’m holding
Girl all I want is you
you know you’re the right time
at the right moment
you’re the sunlight
keeps my heart going
It’s you

Cause You’re the right time
at the right moment
You’re the sunlight
keeps my heart going
know when I’m with you
Can’t keep myself from falling
right time at the right moment
It’s you
you it’s you
you it’s you

you it’s you
you
you it’s you
                        
                    |
