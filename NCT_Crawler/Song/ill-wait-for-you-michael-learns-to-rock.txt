                        Bài hát: I’ll Wait For You - Michael Learns To Rock

I know a secret place to go
Nothing to fool me
My heart still glows

Raising up to the air
Just without any care
Yeah i'm watching the birds
That i know how it hurts
To be loving you
And it feels kind of blue

I'm talking to myself
Trying to break the silence
I'm going crazy i had promise
That i will wait for you
Staring through the candle light
I dont longer see your eyes
That i promise
That i'll wait for you

I thought that i saw you
In my room
But that was a ...
Playin with the moon

With my hand on the ground
I've been fooling around
Yeah i'm watching the birds
That i know how it hurts
To be loving you
And it feels kind of blue

I'm talking to myself
Trying to break the silence
I'm going crazy i had promise
That i will wait for you
Staring through the candle light
I dont longer see your eyes
That i promise
That i'll wait for you

The picture of you
It frozen and blue

I'm talking to myself
Trying to break the silence
I'm going crazy i had promise
That i will wait for you
Staring through the candle light
I dont longer see your eyes
That i promise
That i'll wait for you
