                        Bài hát: Beautiful - Anly

Haru natsu aki fuyu wo koe
Umarekawatta to shitemo
Kawaranai kono kimochi de
Anata wo mitsumeteru
Overcoming Spring, Summer, Fall and Winter
I might have been reborn
But I still have these unchanged feelings:
I want to find you!

Warau migime no yoko ni wa
Osoroi no chiisai hokuro
Sasai na shiawase de ii
Sagashite ikou yo
Next to you're smiling right eye is
a matching small facemole.
A slight hapiness is enough
I will search for it.

Itsumo watakushi wo tasukete kureru
Tsuyoi anata da keredo
Hitomi no oku ni futo utsuru sono fuan kara
Anata wo mamoritai
You will always save me
because you are strong.
But from inside your eyes, anxiety suddenly shines through.
I want to protect you!

Beautiful
Aishiteru soba ni iru itsumade mo
Mamoritai sono egao wasuresase ya shinai kara
Sansan to mabushii kono ai wo utao tataeyou
Beautiful
I love you, I will always be at your side.
Protecting that smile, I will never forget it.
I will stand and sing of this brilliant and beautiful love.

Hare no hi mo ame no hi mo
Tatoe sora ga futte kite mo
Shinji tsuzukeru koto wa
Kiseki no hajimari
On sunny days and on rainy days too
Even if the sky would fall.
The thing I will keep believing in
Is the miracle of beginnings.

Tsuyoku dakishimeta toki ni
Kikoeru itooshii oto ni
"Shiawase da ne" to ii aeru
Bokura de aritai
The times I hold very dearly
The sounds I hold very dearly.
I can say that "It's happiness" 
I want to be with you.

Kamisama ga dasu shukudai ni mata
Nakasare kizukasarete
Wasure kaketeta daisetsu na koto
Zutto anata to mamoritai
There is work God still needs to finish.
I'm deeply moved, I will let you know.
The important things we forgot to do
I will always protect you.

Beautiful
Aishiteru soba ni itsumade mo
Mamoritai sono egao wasuresase ya shinai kara
Sansan to mabushii kono ai wo utao tataeyou
Beautiful
I love you, I will always be at your side.
Protecting that smile, I will never forget it.
I will stand and sing of this brilliant and beautiful love.

Ai wo utao
I want to be there for you
Namida egao sono koe mo subete ga sou
Beautiful
I will sing of this love
I want to be there for you
Tears, smiles, that voice too, everything is:
Beautiful

Beautiful
Beautiful

Beautiful
Aishiteru soba ni iru itsumade mo
Mamoritai sono egao wasuresase ya shinai kara
Sansan to mabushii kono ai wo utaou tataeyou
Beautiful
I love you, I will always be at your side.
Protecting that smile, I will never forget it.
I will stand and sing of this brilliant and beautiful love.

I will follow you
I will love you
Itsumade mo
Forever
