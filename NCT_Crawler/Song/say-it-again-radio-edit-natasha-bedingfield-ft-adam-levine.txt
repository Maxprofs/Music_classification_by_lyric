                        Bài hát: Say It Again ( Radio Edit ) - Natasha Bedingfield, Adam Levine

No need to translate 'cause my eyes give me away
Even though my lips don't say
Should be so easy but my head gets in the way
All the things that I wanna tell you

You're the most perfect, yet
Most definitely that I've met
And I wonder if you know that's how I feel about you
I hope you know

'Cause I have so much love for you
Do with it what you will
And I have nothing more to prove
Say to me what you will, say, say it again

Not enough lovers in life to go around
But there's you and there's me, if we don't start it out
It's not hard to let go, enough to let me in
If it's meant to be, it can only be good

You're the most perfect fit
Most definitely that I've met
And I hope that you feel the same way too
About me, just let me know

'Cause I have so much love for you
Do with it what you will, oh yeah
And I have nothing more to prove
Say to me what you will, say, say it again

(Can you take it?)
Can you take it from me?
(Can you take it?)
If I give, can you receive?
(Can you take it, can you take it?)

I'm reaching out
(Can you take it?)
Giving everything
(Will you take it?)

I give you my heart
Give you my soul
I give you it all

'Cause I have so much love for you
Do with it what you will
And I have nothing more to prove
Say to me what you will, say, say it again

'Cause I have so much love for you
Do with it what you will
And I have nothing more to prove
Say to me what you will, say, say it again
                        
                    |
