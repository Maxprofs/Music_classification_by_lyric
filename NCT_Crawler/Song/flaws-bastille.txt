                        When all of your flaws and all of my flaws are laid out one by one
Wonderful part of the mess that we made we pick ourselves undone
All of your flaws and all of my flaws, they lie there hand in hand
Ones we've inherited, ones that we learn, they pass from man to man

There's a hole in my soul
I can't fill it, I can't fill it
And there's a hole in my soul
Can you fill it? Can you fill it?

You have always worn your flaws upon your sleeve
And I have always buried them deep beneath the ground
Dig them out, let's finish what we started
Dig them out, so nothing's left untouched

All of your flaws and all of my flaws, they may have been exude
We'll see that we need them to be who we are
Without them we'd be doomed

There's a hole in my soul
I can't fill it, I can't fill it
And there's a hole in my soul
Can you fill it? Can you fill it?

You have always worn your flaws upon your sleeve
And I have always buried them deep beneath the ground
Dig them out, let's finish what we started
Dig them out, so nothing's left untouched

When all of your flaws and all of my flaws are counted (x2)

You have always worn your flaws upon your sleeve
And I have always buried them deep beneath the ground
Dig them out, let's finish what we started
Dig them out, so nothing's left untouched

All of your flaws and all of my flaws, they laid out one by one
Look at the wonderful mess that we made we pick ourselves undone
