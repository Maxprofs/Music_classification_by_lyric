ENG trans
My embrace is a fortress to you, I am thrown away by others
Love – I can’t see the end of that dark tunnel so I’m very afraid
Like a desert with a blazing sun, like a person crying out of thirst
Kiss me ma baby, before this night is over, hurry, to me, day by day
I miss your embrace, I guess I loved you too much
When this night passes, it’ll become tears to wipe off – tok tok tok^
If that silver moon sets, will it disappear – Your scent that still remains?
Will the dream-like memories also scatter?
Like rain drops, far away, tok tok tok
Kiss me baby I’ll must be stay here Day by Day
Whisper that you love me
Kiss me baby Just you can take me Day by Day
Before my tears dry up

(Ddurururururu Ddurudu)
Like the wind, you disappeared
(Ddurururururu Ddurudu)
Day by day, I miss you, day by day
Tonight, I long for the passing by memories, I hear your voice
The countless nights when we promised eternity, they become tears – tok tok tok
At the thought of you leaving, again tears fall
Please tell me you will return so our love can be forever
You leave me and go far far away, follow that road and disappear
At the end of this crazy love is the dangerous cliff,
I was infected by this tough love and kept trembling
I hope my lips that recite this sad poem will be remembered in your black eyes
Kiss me ma baby, before this night is over, hurry, to me, day by day
Kiss me baby I’ll must be stay here Day by Day
It’s sad but I will erase you
Kiss me baby Just you can take me Day by Day
Before my tears dry up
kiss me baby take me day by day
