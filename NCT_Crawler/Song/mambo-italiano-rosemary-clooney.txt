                        A girl went back to Napoli
 Because she missed the scenery
 The native dances and the charming songs
 But wait a minute, something's wrong
 Hey, mambo! Mambo italiano!
 Hey, mambo! Mambo italiano
 Go, go, go you mixed up sicialiano
 All you calabraise-a do the mambo like a crazy
 Hey mambo, don't wanna tarantella
 Hey mambo, no more a mozzarella
 Hey mambo! Mambo italiano!
 Try an enchilada with a fish baccala and then a
 Hey gumba, I love a how you dance rhumba
 But take a some advice paisano
 Learn how to mambo
 If you gonna be a square
 You ain't a gonna go nowhere
 Hey mambo! mambo italiano!
 Hey mambo! mambo italiano!
 Go, go, Joe, shake like a Giovanno
 E lo che se dice you get happy in the feets
 When you mambo italiano
 Shake-a Baby shake-a cause i love a when you take a me
 Mama say "stop-a or I'm gonna tell papa"
 And a hey jadrool you don't a have to go to school
 Just make-a with a big bambino
 It's a like a vino
 Kid you good a lookin' but you don't a-know what's cookin' till you
