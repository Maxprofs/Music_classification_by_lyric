                        Bài hát: Say You Do - Janet Jackson

If you love me, say, "You do"
 If you want me, say, "You do"
 If you need me, say, "You do"
 If you love me, say, "You do" Your body chemistry, your history, your smile
 I like it, I like your style
 Magnetic mystery, your hypnotistic child
 I'm knee deep, You drive me wild If you love me, say, "You do"
 If you want me, say, "You do"
 If you need me, say, "You do"
 If you love me, say, "You do" So electrifying, you soon might just blow my fuse
 Love skipper, it's you I choose
 I'd buy a trip, desire, systematic smooth
 I'm hooked up, I'm hooked on you
                        
                    |
