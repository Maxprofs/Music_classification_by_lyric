Is this the real life -
Is this just fantasy -
Caught in a landslide -
No escape from reality -
Open your eyes
Look up to the skies and see -
Im just a poor boy, I need no sympathy -
Because Im easy come, easy go,
A little high, little low,
Anyway the wind blows, doesnt really matter to me,
 - to me -,
Mama, just killed a man,
Put a gun against his head,
Pulled my trigger, now hes dead,
Mama, life had just begun,
But now Ive gone and thrown it all away -
Mama, ooo,
Didnt mean to make you cry -
If Im not back again this time tomorrow -
Carry on, carry on, as if nothing really matters -
Too late, my time has come,
Sends shivers down my spine,
Bodys aching all the time,
Goodbye everybody - Ive got to go -
Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth -
Mama, ooo -
I dont want to die,
I sometimes wish Id never been born at all -
I see a little silhouetto of a man,
Scaramouche, scaramouche will you do the Fandango -
Thunderbolt and lightning - very very frightening me -
Galileo, Galileo,
Galileo, Galileo
Galileo figaro - Magnifico -
But Im just a poor boy and nobody loves me -
Hes just a poor boy from a poor family -
Spare him his life from this monstrosity -
Easy come easy go -, will you let me go -
Bismillah! No -, we will not let you go - let him go -
Bismillah! We will not let you go - let him go
Bismillah! We will not let you go - let me go
 Will not let you go - let me go
 Will not let you go - let me go
No, no, no, no, no, no, no -
Mama mia, mama mia, mama mia let me go -
Beelzebub has a devil put aside for me, for me -
 for me -
So you think you can stone me and spit in my eye -
So you think you can love me and leave me to die -
Oh Baby - Cant do this to me baby -
Just gotta get out - just gotta get right outta here -
Nothing really matters,
Anyone can see,
Nothing really matters -, nothing really matters to me
Any way the wind blows...
