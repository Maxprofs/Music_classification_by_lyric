                        Tonight I'm gonna have myself a real good time
I feel alive
And the world turning inside out, yeah
And floating around in ecstasy, so
Don't stop me now, don't stop me
'Cos I'm having a good time, having a good time

I'm a shooting star leaping through the sky
Like a tiger defying the laws of gravity
I'm a racing car passing by like Lady Godiva
I'm gonna go, go, go
There's no stopping me

[Chorus:]
I'm burning through the sky, yeah
Two hundred degrees,
That's why they call me Mr. Fahrenheit
I'm traveling at the speed of light
I want to make a supersonic man out of you

Don't stop me now
I'm having such a good time
I'm having a ball
Don't stop me now
If you want to have a good time
Just give me a call
Don't stop me now
Because I'm having a good time
Don't stop me now
Yes I'm having a good time
I don't want to stop at all, yeah

I'm a rocket ship on my way to Mars
On a collision course
I am a satellite, I'm out of control
I am a sex machine ready to reload
Like an atom bomb about to
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, explode

I'm burning through the sky, yeah
Two hundred degrees
That's why they call me Mr. Fahrenheit
I'm traveling at the speed of light
I want to make a supersonic woman of you

Don't stop me, don't stop me
Don't stop me, hey, hey, hey!
Don't stop me, don't stop me
Don't stop me, have a good time
Good time, don't stop me
Don't stop me, ah!

(Chorus)

Don't stop me now
I'm having such a good time
I'm having a ball
Don't stop me now
If you want to have a good time
Just give me a call
Don't stop me now
Because I'm having a good time
Don't stop me now
Yes I'm having a good time
I don't want to stop at all
                        
                    |
