                        Have you heard the news? 
Bad things come in twos. 
But I never knew 
'Bout the little things. 

Every single day 
Things get in my way. 
Someone has to pay 
For the little things. 

And I'm through with the stories 
And I'm sick to my shoes.
And the walking and the talking, 
It's got nothing to do with 
The final solution. 
It's a box full of tricks. 
And I'm through with repairs 
When there's nothing to fix, 
When there's nothing to fix, 
When there's nothing to fix, 
And it all comes down to you.

Let the headlines wait, 
Armies hesitate. 
I can deal with fate 
But not the little things. 

Armageddon may 
Arrive anyday. 
I can't get away 
From the little things. 

With a pile of cares 
And a bucket of tears, 
I could look at the sunlight 
And I feel no fear. 
With a mountain of maybes 
And some Icarus wings, 
And I'm armed with delusions 
And one little thing, 
And that one little thing, 
And that one little thing, 
And it all comes down to you.

Have you heard the news? 
Bad things come in twos. 
But I never knew 
'Bout the little things. 

Every single day 
Things get in my way. 
Someone has to pay 
For the little things.
