He Can Only Hold Her

Amy Winehouse

whoo...hoo...

He can only hold her for so long
The lights are on but noone's home
She's so vacant Her soul is taken
He is what she's running from
How can he have her heart
When it got stole
Though he tries to pacify her
Whats inside her never dies
Even if she's content in his warmth
She gets pained with urgency
Urgent kisses
The miss misses
The man that he longs to be
Now how can he have her heart
When it got stole
So he tries to pass it by
Cause what's inside'll never die
So he tries to pacify her
Cause whats inside her never dies
So he tries to pacify her
Cause whats inside her never dies

He Can Only Hold Her

Amy Winehouse
