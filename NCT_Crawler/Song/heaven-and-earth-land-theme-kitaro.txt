Phil Wickham - Heaven And Earth

This is the line we're choosing now to cross
Between Heaven and Earth
Heaven and Earth
You're wiping away the tears that start to drop
From my face
I'm climbing the fences
I'm crossing the sea
I'll cover the distance
I just want You to shine on me
My beating heart is bursting out my skin
To go further up
And further in
Whatever it takes to bring me somewhere higher
Be it rain
Or be it fire
I'm crossing the seas
I'm laying down my life
'Cause I know what You're worth
I'm crossing the great line
I hear You calling me and I come running
Oh, I'm falling into love and nothing will stop it
Oh, I hear You calling and I come running
We're gonna make it
Oh I'm falling into love and nothing will stop it
Oh I hear You calling and I come running
To You, to you, to you
                        
                    |
