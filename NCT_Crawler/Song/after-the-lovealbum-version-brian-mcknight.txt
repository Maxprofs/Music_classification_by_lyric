                        Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ohh, ahh, ooh, hey hey

 [Verse]
 I thought that love would conquer all
 But nothing could break my fall
 The moment you left my side
 And now there's nothing left to say
 Ever since you went away
 I been yearning for you deep inside

 [B sec]
 I can't believe that it's over
 In my arms is where you belong
 When I think about the the love we shared
 How did we go wrong
 And how can I go on
 Can I go on

 [Chorus:]
 Sometimes you can't let go
 Of the love you thought was yours (mine and yours)
 Will I ever get over
 'Cause I've come to know that
 It's so hard to carry on
 After the love is gone
 After the love is gone

 [Verse]
 If I on; y had a clue
 That I'd end up losing you
 I might of held on to my heart
 Taking for granted you'd be mine
 'Til the end of time
 Has torn my world apart

 [B-sec]
 I can't believe that it's over
 In my arms is where you belong
 (Where you belong)
 When I think, think about the love we shared
 How did we go wrong
 And how can I go on

 [Chorus:]
 Sometimes you can't let go
 Of the love you thought was yours (mine and yours)
 Will I ever get over 'cause I've come to know
 That it's so hard to carry on
 After the love is gone
 After the love is gone

 [Musical interlude]

 [B-sec]
 I can't believe that it's over
 In my arms is where you belong (where you belong)
 When I think of all the love we shared
 How did we go wrong
 And how can I go on

 [Chorus:]
 Sometimes you can't let go
 Of the the love you thought was yours, mine and yours
 Will I ever get over 'cause I've come to know
 That it's so hard to carry on
 After the love is gone
 After the love is gone

 [End section]

 (And after the love)
 After the love is gone
 Life must go on
 [Repeat 5 times w/ad lib]
 After the love is gone
                        
                    |
