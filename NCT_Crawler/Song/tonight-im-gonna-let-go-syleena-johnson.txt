                        I know that I made you wait for a very long time
 'Cause I wasn't ready, baby, for you to come inside
 I wanted you to know my name and not just what's between my thighs
 I wanted you to play the game because I knew you get the prize But the game is over, baby, no more you need to fantasize
 'Cause I'm not letting go so come and put your lips on mine
 And I won't even hesitate, oh no baby, not this time
 I'm gonna give you all my loving, gonna make up for lost time I just wanna, I just wanna, wanna break free
 And let you put your hands all over me
 I just wanna lose control, tonight I'm gonna let go
 So baby, come and put your arms around me
 'Cause I think I'm ready to be all you need
 And nobody has to know, tonight I'm gonna let go Won't you come a little closer while I slowly dim the lights
 And put your hands up on my body, baby, you can take your time
 Ain't no need to rush, baby, because we got all night
 I just want to scream your name and make you want to scream mine I tried to fight the feelin', baby, boy, you got me hypnotized
 But I can't help that I've been feelin' lately I think about you all the time
 Tonight I'm gonna get aggressive, baby, so don't you fear put up a fight
 Tonight I'm gonna put it on you, baby, sit back, relax, enjoy the ride I just wanna, I just wanna, wanna break free
 And let you put your hands all over me
 I just wanna lose control, tonight I'm gonna let go
 So baby, come and put your arms around me
 'Cause I think I'm ready to be all you need
 And nobody has to know, tonight I'm gonna let go Tonight I'm gonna let it go
 Tonight I'm gonna let it go, no I just wanna, I just wanna, wanna break free
 And let you put your hands all over me
 I just wanna lose control, tonight I'm gonna let go
 So baby, come and put your arms around me
 'Cause I think I'm ready to be all you need
 And nobody has to know, tonight I'm gonna let go
