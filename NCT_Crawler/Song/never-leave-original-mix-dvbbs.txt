                        Bài hát: Never Leave (Original Mix) - DVBBS

We living up and touch tomorrow memories
We feeling cops, it's more like gets to 7 days
We sing the words of messed up, baby let it be
We found where we belong and we will never leave here

We living up and touch tomorrow memories
We feeling cops, it's more like gets to 7 days
We sing the words of messed up, baby let it be
We found where we belong and we will never leave here

[Melody]

And let us more away
Day, one way 

We found where we belong and we will never leave here

[Break beat]

We will never leave here

We will never leave here

[Melody]

And let us more away


We living up and touch tomorrow memories
We feeling cops, it's more like gets to 7 days
We sing the words of messed up, baby let it be
We found where we belong and we will never leave here

We living up and touch tomorrow memories
We feeling cops, it's more like gets to 7 days
We sing the words of messed up, baby let it be
We found where we belong and we will never leave here

[Melody]

And let us more away
Day, one way 

We found where we belong and we will never leave here

[Break beat]

We will never leave here

We will never leave here
