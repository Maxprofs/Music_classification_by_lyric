                        Bài hát : And I Am Telling You I'm Not Going - Performed by Jennifer Hudson, Dreamgirls
And I am telling you
 I'm not going.
 You're the best man I'll ever know.
 There's no way I can ever go,
 No, no, no, no way,
 No, no, no, no way I'm livin' without you.
 I'm not livin' without you.
 I don't want to be free.
 I'm stayin',
 I'm stayin',
 And you, and you, you're gonna love me.
 Ooh, you're gonna love me. And I am telling you
 I'm not going,
 Even though the rough times are showing.
 There's just no way,
 There's no way.
 We're part of the same place.
 We're part of the same time.
 We both share the same blood.
 We both have the same mind.
 And time and time we have so much to share, No, no, no,
 No, no, no way,
 I'm not wakin' up tomorrow mornin'
 And findin' that there's nobody there.
 Darling, there's no way,
 No, no, no, no way I'm livin' without you.
 I'm not livin' without you.
 You see, there's just no way,
 There's no way. Please don't go
 Away from me
 Stay with me,stay with me
 Stay, stay and hold me
 Stay, stay and hold me
 Oh please stay and hold me
 miss me
 Try and miss me
 Try and miss me
 Oh i know, i know, i know you care Tear down the mountains,
 Yell, scream and shout.
 You can say what you want,
 I'm not walkin' out.
 Stop all the rivers,
 Push, strike, and kill.
 I'm not gonna leave you,
 There's no way I will. And I am telling you
 I'm not going.
 You're the best man I'll ever know.
 There's no way I could ever, ever go,
 No, no, no, no way,
 No, no, no, no way I'm livin' without you.
 Oh, I'm not livin' without you,
 I'm not livin' without you.
 I don't wanna be free.
 I'm stayin',
 I'm stayin',
 And you, and you, and you
 You're gonna love me.
 Oh, yeah, you're gonna love me,
 Yes, you are, love me,
 Ooh, ooh, ooh, love me,
 Love me,
 Love me,
 Love me,
 Love me.
 You're gonna love me.
