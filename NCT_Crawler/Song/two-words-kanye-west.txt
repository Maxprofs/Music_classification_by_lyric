                        We in the streets player, get your mail
 It's only two places you'll end up, either dead or in jail
 Still nowhere to go, still nowhere to go
 Now throw ya hands up bustless, busters, boosters, hoes
 Everybody, *** that
 Still nowhere to go, sill nowhere to go Two words, United States, no love, no brakes
 Low brow, high stakes, crack smoke, black folks
 Big Macs, fat folks, ecstasy capsules
 Presidential scandals, everybody move!
 Two words, Mos Def, K West, hot ***
 Calm down, get back, ghetto people, got this
 Game ball, lock ***, dump off, cock ***
 We won't stop ***, everybody move!
 Two words, BK , NY, Bed-Stuy
 Two hawks, too hungry, too many, that's why
 These streets know game, can't ball, don't play
 Every traffic, one lane, everybody move!
 Two words, Mos Def, black jack, hot ***
 Calm down, get back, ghetto people, got this
 Game point lock, long pump cocked
 We won't stop, everybody move! Now throw ya hands up bustless, busters (Throw your hands up high)
 Boostas, hoes, everybody, *** that (oh)

 One wall, twenty plaques, dudes say, "Gimme that"

 Go get his rhyme like, should of been signed twice
 Most imitated, Grammy nominated
 Hotel accommodated, cheerleader, prom dated
 Barbershop, player hated, mom and pop, bootlegged it

 Two words, Chi town, raised me, crazy
 So I live by two words, "*** you, pay me"

 Boostas, hoes, everybody, *** that (oh)
 Still nowhere to go, still nowhere to go (oh) Two words, Freeway, two letters, A-R
 Turn y'all rap niggas into two words, fast runners
 Like Jackie Jurner, you better sleep with your burner
 The heat skeet, blow a reef through ya car
 My God, two words, no guns, break arms
 Break necks, break backs, Steven Segul
 Free young bars, fresh men of the Roc
 Left the beef in the pot Jay sent for his dogs
 And broads, forget ya squad, let em find for yourself
