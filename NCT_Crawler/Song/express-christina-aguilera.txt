It's a cold and crazy world that's ragin' outside
Well baby me and all my girls are bringin' on the fire
Show a little leg, gotta shimmy your chest
It's a life, it's a style, it's a need, it's burlesque

E-X-P-R-E-S-S.
Love, sex, ladies no regrets
E-X-P-R-E-S-S.
Love, sex, ladies no regrets
Been holding down for quite some time
And finally the moment's right
I love to make the people stare
They know I got that certain savoir faire
Fasten up, could you imagine what would happen
if I let you close enough to touch?
Step into the fantasy, you'll never want to leave,
baby let's give it to you (WHY?)
It's a passion, and emotion, it's a fashion, burlesque
It'll move, goin' through you, so do what I do, burlesque
All ladies come put your grown up, boys throw it up if you want it
Can you feel me, can you feel it? It's burlesque.
Burlesque

I tease 'em 'til they're on the edge
They screamin' for more and for more they beg
I know it's me they come to see
My pleasure brings them to their knees
Fasten up, could you imagine what would happen
if I let you close enough to touch?
Step into the fantasy, you'll never want to leave,
baby let's give it to you (WHY?)
It's a passion, and emotion, it's a fashion, burlesque
It'll move, goin' through you, so do what I do, burlesque
All ladies come put your grown up, boys throw it up if you want it
Can you feel me, can you feel it? It's burlesque.
Burlesque...
It's a passion, and emotion, it's a fashion, burlesque
It'll move, goin' through you, so do what I do, burlesque
All ladies come put your grown up, boys throw it up if you want it
Can you feel me, can you feel it? It's burlesque.

Burlesque ...
