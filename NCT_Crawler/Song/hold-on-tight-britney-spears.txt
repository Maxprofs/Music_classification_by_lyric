                        Bài hát: Hold On Tight - Britney Spears

So wicked
In the way he moves
Don't miss it
Do not be a fool

It's a long way
It's a long way home
Light inside of me
It ignites my bones

He comes to me in my dreams
And tells me what I need to know
He makes me feel sweaty
He guides me to the lights above
I just wanna fall into his arms tonight
Someone tell me I, I will be alright
Hold on tight




Remembering, I forever will
Surrendering, just how we felt

It's a long way
It's a long way home
Light inside of me
It ignites my bones

He comes to me in my dreams
And tells me what I need to know
He makes me feel sweaty
He guides me to the lights above
I just wanna fall into his arms tonight
Someone tell me I, I will be alright
Hold on tight

And when it's all the fundering great
The cinema is fading away
I gotta make my way throigh the night
Every night will follow my night
And when I'm lost, and I can't the find the way
I'll feel the kisses breaking away
Hold myself with all of my might
Don't let go
Just hold on tight

He comes to me in my dreams
And tells me what I need to know
He makes me feel sweaty
He guides me to the lights above
I just wanna fall into his arms tonight
Someone tell me I, I will be alright
Hold on tight
                        
                    |
