                        Bài hát : Sleepsong - Secret Garden

Lay down your head
And I’ll sing you a lullaby
Back to the years
Of loo-li,lai-ley
And I’ll sing you to sleep
And I’ll sing you tomorrow
Bless you with love
For the road that you go
May you sail fair
To the far fields of fortune
With dimonds and pearls
At your head and your feet
And may you need never
To banish missfortune
May you find kindness
In all that you meet
May there always be angels
To watch over you
To guard you each step of the way
To guard you and keep you
Safe from all harm
Loo-li,loo-li,lai-ley
May you bring love
And may you bring happieness
Be loved in return
To the end your days
Now fall of to sleep
I’m not meaning to keep you
I’ll just sit for awhile
And sing
Loo-li,lai-ley
May there always be angels
To watch over you
To guard you each step of the way
To guard you and keep you
Safe from all harm
Loo-li,loo-li,lai-ley
Loo-li,loo-li,lai-ley
