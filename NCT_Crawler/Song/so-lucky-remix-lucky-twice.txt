                        Bài hát: So Lucky (Remix) - Lucky Twice

You can fool yourself 
i promise it will help 
now every single day 
i just wanna hear you saying 

laughing through the day 
thinking you are never boring(?) 
speeding through the night 
maybe you not count the morning(?) 

there's nothing you can do 
to keep it out 
there's nothing you can do 
just scream and shout 

living for today but you just can't find tomorrow 
talking about the joy 
but it never stops the sorrow 

there's nothing you can do 
to keep it out 
there's nothing you can do 
just scream and shout 
saying 

I'm so lucky lucky I'm 
so lucky lucky I'm 
so lovely lovely I'm 
so lovely lovely 

you can fool yourself 
i promise it will help 
now every single day 
i just wanna hear you saying 

I'm so lucky lucky 
I'm so lucky lucky 
I'm so lovely lovely 
I'm so lovely lovely 

you can fool yourself 
i promise it will help 
now every single day 
i just wanna hear you saying 

even though you said 
it would never end it's over 
you were smiling on my arm 
now you're crying on my shoulder 

there's nothing you can do 
to keep it out 
there's nothing you can do 
just scream and shout 
saying 

I'm so lucky lucky 
I'm so lucky lucky 
I'm so lovely lovely 
I'm so lovely lovely 

you can fool yourself 
i promise it will help 
now every single day 
i just wanna hear you saying 

I'm so lucky lucky 
I'm so lucky lucky 
I'm so lovely lovely 
I'm so lovely lovely 

you can fool yourself 
i promise it will help 
now every single day 
i just wanna hear you saying 

you can never be forever 
good together (?) 
young and clever (?) 
you can never be forever 
but keep it up 
don't ever stop 
through night and day 
the words to say are: 

I'm so lucky lucky I'm 
so lucky lucky I'm 
so lovely lovely I'm 
so lovely lovely 

you can fool yourself 
i promise it will help 
now every single day 
i just wanna hear you saying 

you can fool yourself 
i promise it will help 
now every single day 
i just wanna hear you saying 

I'm so lucky lucky 
I'm so lucky lucky 
I'm so lovely lovely 
I'm so lovely lovely 

you can fool yourself 
i promise it will help 
now every single day 
i just wanna hear you saying 

you can fool yourself 
i promise it will help 
now every single day 
i just wanna hear you saying
                        
                    |
