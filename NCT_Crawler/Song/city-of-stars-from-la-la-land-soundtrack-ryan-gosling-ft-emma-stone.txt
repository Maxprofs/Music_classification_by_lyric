                        Bài hát: City Of Stars (From La La Land Soundtrack) - Ryan Gosling, Emma Stone

[Ryan]

City of stars,
Are you shining just for me?
City of stars,
There's so much that i can't see.

Who knows,
I felt it from the first embrace
I shared with you...

[Emma]

That now
Our dreams,
They've finally come true.

City of stars,
Just one thing everybody wants.

There in the bars,
and through the smokescreen of the crowded restaurants,
It's love,
Yes, all we're looking for is love
From someone else...

[Ryan-Emma]

- A rush,
- A glance,
- A touch,
- A dance,

[Together]

To look in somebody's eyes,
To light up the skies,
To open the world and send me reeling,
A voice that says, I'll be here, and you'll be alright.

I don't care if I know
Just where I will go
'Cause all that I need, this crazy feeling,

Ra-ta-tat of my heart -

[Ryan]
I think I want it to stay.

City of stars,
Are you shining just for me?
City of stars,

[Emma]

You never shined so bright-ly.
                        
                    |
