                        Bài hát: Next To Me - Axel Johansson, Tina Stachowiak

I hate that I love you, hate that I love you
Try not but I do, oh, but it feel so good
So good

I’m so drunk in love now, so drunk in love now
Drinking about you, oh, but it feel so good
So good

Oh, all I see is everything that we could be
You’ll never be alone with me
You’ll never be alone with me
Oh, all you need is just a little clarity
You’ll never be alone with me
You’ll never be alone

Right next to me
Right next to me
Right next to me
Never alone, no
Right next to me
Right next to me

I look into your eyes, look into your eyes
Uh, is you shaking? Doesn’t mean we’re bound for life
For life

Just stay here for one night, stay here for one night
Oh, don’t say maybe, doesn’t mean we’re bound for life
For life

Oh, all I see is everything that we could be
You’ll never be alone with me
You’ll never be alone with me
Oh, all you need is just a little clarity
You’ll never be alone with me
You’ll never be alone

Right next to me
Right next to me
Right next to me
Never alone, no
Right next to me
All night
Right next to me

Right next to me
Never alone, no
Right next to me
All night

I hate that I love you, hate that I love you
Try not but I do, oh, but it feel so good
So good
