                        Funny how I'm on myself with you
 Than I ever knew
 If I see that it's eleven I'll say it's seven
 To spend more time with you So here you know what I'm saying
 To you this evening, think it through
 You thought I was your best friend
 There to your defense, I reach for someone new Hold on, hold on, hold on to what we have
 Yesterday is gone and the night is long
 We'll hold on to what we have Even though I've been with someone else
 I'm so happy when I'm with you
 And here we are again on some lost weekend
 Yeah we are one or two So here you know what I'm saying
 To you this evening, think it through
 You thought I was your best friend
 There to your defense, I know that I had you Hold on, hold on, hold on to what we have
 Yesterday is gone and the night is long
 We'll hold on to what we have Nothing leaves your mind but breaks your heart
 But we both knew this from the start
 I could mend your life or ease your pain Hold on, hold on, hold on to what we have
 Yesterday is gone and the night is long
 We'll hold on to what we have Hold on, hold on, hold on to what we have
 Yesterday is gone and the night is long
 We'll hold on to what we have Hold on to what we have, hold on, hold on
