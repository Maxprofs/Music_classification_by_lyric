                        Bài hát: Thursday/Froze Over ("Interlude") - BlackBear

[Part I: Thursday]

[Intro]
Oh, yeah
Beartrap trap music

[Verse 1]
Me and Justin Bieber *** the same girls
Me and G-Eazy *** the same Wilhelmina models
Me and Chris Brown got the same H-Town
Had to block all your accounts, they all gonna find out about you

[Pre-Chorus]
Woah, the truth
That I did it with another girl on Thursday after you
All this *** we did up on your birthday
Honestly, it's just to me another Thursday

[Chorus]
I need to re-up, re-up
Kick my feet up, feet up
Pour another four in my one liter, liter
Need to re-up, re-up
Instagram sluts
'Cause everybody dies and love is fake as ***
I need to re-up, re-up
Kick my feet up, feet up
Pour another four in my one liter, liter
Truth is all this *** we doin' on your birthday, woah
To me, that's just another Thursday, just another Thursday to me
Got a ho every single day of the week, baby
Oh

[Verse 2]
Me and Lil Uzi Vert *** the same girls
Jared Leto get more than me, but it's alright
And Bruno Mars sing these hoes to sleep
If we talkin' pipes, I'ma lay it right there

[Pre-Chorus]
Woah, the truth
That I did it with another girl on Thursday after you
All this *** we did up on your birthday
Honestly, it's just to me another Thursday

[Chorus]
I need to re-up, re-up
Kick my feet up, feet up
Pour another four in my one liter, liter
Need to re-up, re-up
Instagram sluts
'Cause everybody dies and love is fake as ***
I need to re-up, re-up
Kick my feet up, feet up
Pour another four in my one liter, liter
Truth is all this *** we doin' on your birthday, woah
To me, that's just another Thursday, just another Thursday to me
Got a ho every single day of the week, baby
Oh

[Part II: Froze over]

[Refrain]
My heart froze over
My heart froze over
My heart froze over
My heart froze over
My heart froze over
My heart froze over
My heart froze over
My heart froze over
My heart froze over
My heart froze over

My heart froze over
My heart froze over
My heart froze over
My heart froze over
My heart froze over
                        
                    |
