Âu Mỹ khác|

                        There is something that I see
In the way you look at me
There’s a smile, there’s a truth
In your eyes

What an unexpected way
On this unexpected day
Could it be this is where I belong
It is you I have loved all along

There's no more mystery, it is finally clear to me
You’re the home my heart searched for so long
And it is you I have loved all along

There were times I ran to hide
Afraid to show the other side
Alone in the night without you

But now I know just who you are
And I know you hold my heart
Finally this is where I belong
And it is you I have loved all along

There's no more mystery, it is finally clear to me
You’re the home my heart searched for so long
It is you I have loved all along

Over and over I’m filled with emotion
Your love, it rushes through my veins
And I am filled with the sweetest devotion
As I look into your perfect face

no more mystery, it is finally clear to me
You’re the home my heart searched for so long
And it is you I have loved
It is you I have loved
It is you I have loved all along
                        
                    |
