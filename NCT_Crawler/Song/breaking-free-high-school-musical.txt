                        Troy: We’re soaring, flying
There’s not a star in heaven
That we can’t reach
Gabriella: If we’re trying,
So we’re breaking free
Troy: You know the world can see us
In a way that’s different than who we are
Gabriella: Creating space between us
’Til we’re separate hearts
Both: But your faith, it gives me strength
Strength to believe...
CHORUS 1
We’re breaking free
We’re soaring, flying
There’s not a star in heaven
That we can’t reach
If we’re trying, yeah we’re breaking free
Troy: Can you feel it building
Like a wave the ocean just can’t control
Gabriella: Connected by a feeling
In our very souls
Both: Rising ’til it lifts us up
So everyone can see...
CHORUS 2
We’re breaking free
We’re soaring, flying
There’s not a star in heaven
That we can’t reach
If we’re trying, yeah we’re breaking free
Running, climbing
To get to that place
To be all that we can be
Now’s the time so we’re breaking free
More than hope
More than faith
This is truth
This is fate
And together, we see it coming
More than you
More than me
Not a want, but a need
Both of us breaking free
CHORUS 2
Both: You know the world can see us
In a way that’s different than who we are
                        
                    |
