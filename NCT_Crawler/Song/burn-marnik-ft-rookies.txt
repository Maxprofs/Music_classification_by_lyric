                        Bài hát: Burn - Marnik, Rookies

Yeah, yeah
You look familiar, skin like vanilla
You're onto me, I'm onto you
I gotta make it work
And my blood like tequila
And that's making me weaker

I look, you look
Our bodies stop, you need to stay your way
No dancing like nobody else, nobody's watching
And if you let me
I won't take it, I won't take it
Slow oh oh, all the way
Eh eh, we can go oh oh
You are fire, you are fire
Wanna burn
Burn, burn, burn it up
Uh uh, let you know oh oh
You are fire, you are fire
Wanna burn

(You are fire, you are fire, you are fire)
(Wanna burn)
(You are fire, you are fire, you are fire)
(Wanna burn)
(You are fire, you are fire, you are fire)
(Wanna burn)
(You are a fire you are fire)
You are fire
Wanna burn

Now we got familiar
We melt like we're chocolate
I taste your love, you're like a drug
Yeah I'm gon' give you all
All my attention, to all your dimensions
Let's do the things we're made to do
And let our bodies talk

Let's do it like nobody else, nobody's watching
And if you let me
I won't take it, I won't take it
Slow oh oh, all the way
Eh eh, we can go oh oh
You are fire, you are fire
Wanna burn
Burn, burn, burn it up
Uh uh, let you know oh oh
You are fire, you are fire
Wanna burn

(You are fire, you are fire, you are fire)
(Wanna burn)
(You are fire, you are fire, you are fire)
(Wanna burn)
(You are fire, you are fire, you are fire)
(Wanna burn)
(You are fire, you are fire)

I won't take it, I won't take it
Slow oh oh oh, all the way
Eh eh eh, we can go oh oh oh
You are fire, you are fire
Wanna burn
Burn, burn, burn it up
Uh uh, let you know oh oh
You are fire, you are fire
Wanna burn

(You are fire, you are fire, you are fire)
(Wanna burn)
(You are fire, you are fire, you are fire)
(Wanna burn)
(You are fire, you are fire, you are fire)
(Wanna burn)
(You are fire, you are fire, you are fire)
(Wanna burn)
