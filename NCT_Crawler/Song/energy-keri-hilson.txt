                        Bài hát: Energy - Keri Hilson

I wish I could rip out a page of my memory
'cause I put to much energy in him and me
Can't wait till I get through this phase
'cause it's killing me
To bad we can't re-write our own history

Such a mystery when he's here with me
It's hard to believe I'm still lonely
Chance's fading now, patience running out
This ain't how it's supposed to be

I'm having nightmares from sleeping with the enemy
How do we re-reverse the chemistry
I don't want us to be the end of me
This love is taking all of my energy
Energy, my energy
Taking all my energy
Energy, my energy
Taking all of (my energy)

Seems only like yesterday, not even gravity
Could keep your feet off the ground when you go to me
How can two be as one
We've become to divided now
There's no use hiding from my misery

Such a mystery when he's here with me
It's hard to believe I'm still lonely
Chance's fading now, patience running out
This ain't how it's supposed to be

I'm having nightmares from sleeping with the enemy
How do we re-reverse the chemistry
I don't want us to be the end of me
This love is taking all of my energy
Energy, my energy
Taking all my energy
Energy, my energy
Taking all of (my energy)

Now I can feel a change in me
And I can't afford to slip much further
From the person I was meant to be
I'm not afraid to walk alone
Not give it up but moving on
Before it gets too deep
'cause you're taking all of my energy

I'm having nightmares from sleeping with the enemy
How do we reverse the chemistry
I don't want us to be the end of me
This love is taking all of my energy

I'm having nightmares from sleeping with the enemy
How do we re-reverse the chemistry
I don't want us to be the end of me
This love is taking all of my energy
Energy, my energy
Taking all my energy
Energy, my energy
Taking all of (my energy)

You're killing me
You're taking all of me yeah, oh
This love is taking all of my energy
                        
                    |
