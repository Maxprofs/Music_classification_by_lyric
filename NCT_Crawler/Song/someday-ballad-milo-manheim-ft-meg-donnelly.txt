                        Bài hát: Someday - Ballad - Milo Manheim, Meg Donnelly

[Intro: Meg Donnelly] 
Ohh 
La la la la la 
Ohh 
Yeah 

[Verse 1: Meg Donnelly & Milo Manheim, Both] 
I know it might be crazy 
But did you hear the story? 
I think I heard it vaguely 
A girl and a zombie 
Oh, tell me more, boy 
Yeah 
Sounds like a fantasy 
Oh, what could go so wrong 
With a girl and a zombie 
You're from the perfect paradise 
And I'm living on the darker side 
Ooh, I've got a feeling 
If you get to know me 
Right from the start you caught my eye 
And something inside me came to life 
Ooh, I've got a feeling 
If you get to know me 

[Chorus: Meg Donnelly & Milo Manheim, Both] 
Someday 
This could be, this could be ordinary 
Someday 
Could we be something extraordinary? 
You and me side by side 
Yeah, yeah 
Out in the broad daylight 
If they laugh, we'll say 
We're gonna be someday 
We're gonna be someday 
Someday, someday 
We're gonna be someday 
We're gonna be someday 

[Verse 2: Meg Donnelly & Milo Manheim, Both] 
Girl, you look delicious 
Oh, I mean gorgeous 
Well, now you're getting fearless 
No, I'm just rooting for us 
If different was a super power 
We'd be so flawless 
Yeah, we could make these two worlds ours 
I'm rooting for us 
Two lonely hearts meet in the dark 
Imagine it now they start a spark 
You got my attention 
What happens next, then? 
Movies and long walks in the park 
Hanging out anywhere we want 
I like the way you're thinking 
I can almost see it 

[Chorus: Meg Donnelly & Milo Manheim, Both] 
Someday 
This could be, this could be ordinary 
Someday 
Could we be something extraordinary? 
You and me side by side 
Out in the broad daylight 
If they laugh, we'll say 
We're gonna be someday 
Someday, someday 

[Bridge: Meg Donnelly] 
So let them talk if they wanna 
Let them talk if they're gonna 
We're gonna do what we wanna 
Let them talk, let them talk 
If they wanna, they wanna 

[Bell rings] 

[Chorus: Meg Donnelly & Milo Manheim, Both] 
Someday 
This could be, this could be ordinary 
Someday 
Could we be something extraordinary? 
You and me side by side 
Out in the broad daylight 
If they laugh, we'll say 
We're gonna be someday 
Someday, someday 
We're gonna be someday 
Someday, someday 
We're gonna be someday
                        
                    |
