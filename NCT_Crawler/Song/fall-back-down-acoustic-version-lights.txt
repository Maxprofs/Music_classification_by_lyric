                        Bài hát:Fall Back Down (Acoustic Version) - Lights

Don't worry about me I'm gonna make it alright
Got my enemies crosshaired in my sight
I take a bad situation gonna make it right
In the shadow of darkness I stand in the light

See it's our style to keep it true
I've had a bad year, a lot I've gone through
I've been knocked out, beat down, black and blue
She's not the one coming back for you
She's not the one coming back for you

If I fall back down
You're gonna help me back up again
If I fall back down
You're gonna be my friend

If I fall back down
You're gonna help me back up again
If I fall back down
You're gonna be my friend

It takes disaster to learn a lesson
We're gonna make it through the darkest nights
Some people betray one and cause treason
We're gonna make everything alright

The worst of times now, they don't faze me
Even if I look and act really crazy
On my way down she betrayed me
Now my vision is no longer hazy

I'm very lucky to have my crew
They stood by me when she flew
I've been knocked out, beat down, black and blue
She's not the one coming back for you
She's not the one coming back for you

if I fall back down your gonna help me back up again 
if I fall back down you gonna be my friend 
if I fall back down your gonna help me back up again 
if i fall back down your gonna be my friend 
if i fall back down your gonna help me back up again
if I fall back down your gonna be my friend
                        
                    |
