                        Bài hát: You're My heart - Modem Talking

Deep in my heart there’s a fire burning hot
Deep in my heart there’s desire for a star
I’m dying in motion.It’s my word in fantasy
I’m living in my, living in my dreams.

Ref: You’re my heart, you’re my soul
I’ll keep it shinning every where I go
You’re my heart, you’re my soul
I’ll be holding you forever,staying with you together
You’re my heart, you’re my soul
Yeah!I feel that our love will grow
You’re my heart, you’re my soul
That’s only thing I really know

Let’s look for a star and believe my burning heart
Feeling all right,come open up your heart
I’m keep the candle burning.Let your body melt in mine
I’m living in my, living in my dreams
