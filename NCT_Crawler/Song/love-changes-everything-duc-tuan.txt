                        Bài Hát: Love Changes Everything - Đức Tuấn

Love, love changes everything
Hands and faces, earth and sky
Love, love changes everything
How you live and how you die

Love, can make the summer fly
Or a night seem like a lifetime
Yes love, 
love changes everything

Now I tremble at your name
Nothing in the world 
will ever be the same

Love, love changes everything
Days are longer, 
words mean more
Love, love changes everything

Pain is deeper than before
Love will turn your world around
And that world will last forever
Yes love, 
love changes everything

Brings you glory, 
brings you shame
Nothing in the world 
will ever be the same

Off into the world we go
Planning futures, 
shaping years
Love (comes in) and suddenly 

all our wisdom disappears
Love makes fools of everyone
All the rules 
we made are broken
Yes love, 
love changes everyone
Live or perish in its flame
Love will never never let you 
be the same
