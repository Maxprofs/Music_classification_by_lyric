When you're talking to yourself.
And nobody's home
you can fool yourself.
you came in this world alone.(alone)

So nobody ever told you bady.
How it was gonna be.
So what'll happen to you baby.
Guess we'll have to wait and see.
(One two)
Old at heart but I'm only 28.28
I'm much too young to let love break my heart.
Young at heart,but it's getting much too late.,
To find ourselves so far apart.
I don't know how you've supposed to find me lately
And what more could you ask from me.
How could you say that I never needed you.
When you took everything.
Say you took everything,baby!

Young at heart and it gets so hard to wait.
When no one I know can seem to help me now
Old at heart but I mustn't hesitate.,
If I'm to find my own way out
Still talking to myself and nobody's home(alone)

So nobody ever told you bady.,
How it was gonna be.
So what'll happen to us baby.,
Guess we have to wait and see.

When I find out all of the reasons.
Maybe I'll find another way.
Find another day.
With all the changing seasons.
Of my life maybe I'll get it right next time.
And now that you've been broken down.,
Got your head out of the clouds
Back down on the groud.
You don't talk so loud.
You don't walk so proud.
Anymore and what for, 

when I jump into the river
Too many times to make it home.
I'm out here on my own.
All drifting all alone..
If it doesn't show.
Give me time to read between the lines

I've seen the storm getting closer.
And the waves they get so high.
Seems everything we've ever known is here.
Why must it drift and die.

I'll never find anyone to replace you.
Guess I'll have to make it true.
This time. Oh ! This time !!
Without you !!
I knew the storm was getting closer.
And all my friends said I was high.
But everything we've ever known is here.
I never wanted it to die.
