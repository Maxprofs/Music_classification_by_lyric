                        Bài hát: Easy On Me - Jessie J

I show up, the glow up
Blossom little rose
You are the most beautiful when you're buddin' new (hmm)
I pray up, I stay up
What is life with all the clues?
Sometimes I don't know what to do and that's alright

[Pre-Chorus]
I make money, share my time
I need something to be mine
For me, for me, for me, for me, for me
I'm impatient, give me space
Always working, far away
For me, for me, for me, for me, for me

[Chorus]
Please don't be so hard, so hard on my heart
I'm a delicate flower tryna grow inside your arms
Please don't be so cold, be patient while I grow
I wanna try, I won't always get it right but I need you to know
To go easy on me
Go easy, go easy on me
Go easy

[Verse 2]
I gave up, I got up
I'm my daddy's little girl
Hear my mother in my words, I'm staying true
You know what? I saw love
Trust me when I say it's not you
Just try to see my point of view, this *** gets hard


[Pre-Chorus]
I make money, share my time
I need something to be mine
For me, for me, for me, for me, for me
I'm impatient, give me space
Always working, far away
For me, for me, for me, for me, for me

[Chorus]
Please don't be so hard (be so hard), so hard on my heart (on my heart)
I'm a delicate flower tryna grow inside your arms
Please don't be so cold (be so cold), be patient while I grow (while I grow)
I wanna try, I won't always get it right but I need you to know
To go easy on me
Go easy, go easy on me
Go easy
Go easy
Going easy on me
Go easy

[Bridge]
La la la, la la la (go easy)
La la la, la la la (go easy)
La la la, la la, la la (on me)
La la la, la la la (go easy)
La la la, la la la (go easy)
La la la, la la, la la (on me)


[Chorus]
Oh, please don't be so hard, so hard on my heart
I'm a delicate flower tryna grow inside your arms
Go easy on me
Go easy on me
Go easy on me

[Outro: Jessie's grandfather & Jessie J]
You know what darling [??], take it easy
Don't over do it
Do it, but don't abuse yourself, alright?
Okay
And it was lovely seeing you
And I pray the best to you, see you again soon
Good luck with the new shows and whatever you are doing over there, very proud of you, good luck
