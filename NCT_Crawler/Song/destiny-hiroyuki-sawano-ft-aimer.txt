                        Bài hát: Destiny - Hiroyuki Sawano, Aimer

Have a good sleep for mom and dad
What can I do for feeling sad
All of my fear is getting harder
Losing my motion I can't hide
Going my way I want to hurry
Moving my feet and sneaking out
Losing my mind I'm feeling down
Looking for the truth in this life

You can run, You can run
Nothings gonna change the world
If we don't try so hard
You can ride, You can ride
It's a miracle
Waiting for you now in the dark
We were born in a different place
They just want to know where the box is
Everything in the tapestry
We can meet when the fight is done

There are many problems in this world
Today is not always on your side
To the death I'm so scared, It's war
Sky blue in my sight

Down on the street of east of seven
What can I do for feeling bad
All of my fear is getting louder
Losing my notion I can't find
Going my way I want to run
Moving my feet for breaking now
Losing my beat and feeling down
Proud to die for our destiny

You can run, You can run
Nothings gonna change the world
If we don't try so hard
You can ride, You can ride
It's a miracle
Waiting for you now in the dark
We were born in a different place
They just want to know where the box is
Everything in the tapestry
We can meet when the fight is done

There are many problems in this world
Today is not always on your side
To the death I'm so scared, It's war
Sky blue in my sight

There are many conflicts in this world
Unclear my path around the fallen ones
Into the space to back again
So evermore a peace reigns
                        
                    |
