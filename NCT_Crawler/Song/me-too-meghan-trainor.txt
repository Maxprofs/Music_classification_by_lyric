                        Song: Me Too - Meghan Trainor

Who's that sexy thang I see over there?
That's me, standin' in the mirror
What's that icy thang hangin' 'round my neck?
That's gold, show me some respect 

I thank God every day 
That I woke up feelin' this way 
And I can't help lovin' myself
And I don't need nobody else, nuh

If I was you, I'd wanna be me too
I'd wanna be me too
I'd wanna be me too
If I was you, I'd wanna be me too
I'd wanna be me too
I'd wanna be me too

I walk in like a dime piece
I go straight to VIP
I never pay for my drinks
My entourage behind me
My life's a movie, Tom Cruise
So bless me, baby, achoo
And even if they tried to
They can't do it like I do

I thank God every day 
That I woke up feelin' this way 
And I can't help lovin' myself
And I don't need nobody else, nuh

If I was you, I'd wanna be me too
I'd wanna be me too
I'd wanna be me too
If I was you, I'd wanna be me too
I'd wanna be me too
I'd wanna be me too

(Turn the bass up)
Turn the bass up
(Turn the bass up)
Let's go!

I thank God every day 
That I woke up feelin' this way 
And I can't help lovin' myself
And I don't need nobody else, nuh 

If I was you, I'd wanna be me too
I'd wanna be me too
I'd wanna be me too
If I was you, I'd wanna be me too
I'd wanna be me too
I'd wanna be me too
If I was you, I'd wanna be me too
I'd wanna be me too
I'd wanna be me too
If I was you, I'd wanna be me too
I'd wanna be me too
I'd wanna be me too
