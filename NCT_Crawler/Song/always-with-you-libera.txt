                        Always with you ( contact : sonofgod_95)

Do you know me, who I am?
I am always with you
I am near you every day,
Always share what you do

Follow the path to anywhere,
A stranger in the world without you
Forever I will be there,
The shadow you always knew

Beati quorum via, integra est

If you think I’ve gone away,
And am never with you
I am not so far away,
Always shadowing you
                        
                    |
