                        Bài hát: Wonderful Christmas Time - Kylie Minogue, Mika

The moon is right
The spirits up
We're here tonight
And that's enough
Simply having a wonderful Christmas time
Simply having a wonderful Christmas time

The party's on
The feelings here
That all because
This time of year
Simply having a wonderful Christmas time
Simply having a wonderful Christmas time

The choir of children, sing their song
Ding, dong, ding, dong, ding, dong, ding

Simply having a wonderful Christmas time
Simply having a wonderful Christmas time

The word is out
About the town
To lift your glass
And don't look down
Simply having a wonderful Christmas time

The choir of children, sing their song
[?]
Ding, dong, ding, dong...

The party's on
The spirits up
We're here tonight
And that's enough
Simply having a wonderful Christmas time
Simply having a wonderful Christmas time

The moon is right
The spirits up
We're here tonight
And that's enough
Simply having a wonderful Christmas time
Simply having a wonderful Christmas time
Simply having a wonderful Christmas time
