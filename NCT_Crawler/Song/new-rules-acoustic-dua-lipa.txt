                        Bài hát: New Rules (Acoustic) - Dua Lipa

Talking in my sleep at night making myself crazy
Wrote it down and read it out hoping it would save me
My love, he makes me feel like nobody else, nobody else
But my love, he doesn't love me so I tell myself, I tell myself

One, don't pick up the phone
You know he's only calling cause he's drunk and alone
Two, don't let him in
You'll have to kick him out again
Three, don't be his friend

You know you're gonna wake up in his bed in the morning
And if you're under him
You ain't getting over him
I got new rules, I count 'em 

I keep pushing forwards but he keeps pulling me backwards
Now I'm standing back from it. I finally see the pattern
But my love, he doesn't love me so I tell myself, I tell myself
I do, I do, I do

One, don't pick up the phone
You know he's only calling cause he's drunk and alone
Two, don't let him in
You'll have to kick him out again
Three, don't be his friend

You know you're gonna wake up in his bed in the morning
And if you're under him
You ain't getting over him
I got new rules, I count 'em 

Practice makes perfect
I'm still tryna' learn it by heart
Eat, sleep, and breathe it
Rehearse and repeat it, cause I

One, don't pick up the phone
You know he's only calling cause he's drunk and alone
Two, don't let him in
You'll have to kick him out again
Three, don't be his friend

You know you're gonna wake up in his bed in the morning
And if you're under him
You ain't getting over him
I got new rules, I count 'em
You'll get over him
