                        They told me I was lucky, 
To have my chance with you. 
Now last year's summer romance, 
Is this year's winter blues.
I treated you so nicely, 
To jewelery and champagne. 
But you left me empty handed, yeah, 
You left me feeling play- ay ay - ed.

Now I hope you're happy with yourself
'Cause I'm not laughing
Don't you think it's kind of
Crappy what you did this holiday?
When I gave you my heart, 
You ripped it apart
Like wrapping paper trash.
So I wrote you a song
Hope that you sing along and it goes, 
"Merry Christmas, ***."

They say I'm losing my mind, 
I thought that for a while.
I teared down decorations, 
They remind me of your smile.
I hate that mistletoe, 
It makes me think of our first kiss.
You bit my lip, you pulled me close, 
Then you taught me how to quit.
[ Lyrics from: _time_low/merry_christmas_kiss_my_ass.html ]
Now I hope you're happy with yourself, 
'Cause I'm not laughing
Don't you think it's kind of
Crappy what you did this holiday?
When I gave you my heart, 
You ripped it apart
Like wrapping paper trash
So I wrote you a song
Hope that you sing along and it goes, 
"Merry Christmas, ***."

So sick of calling, 
You won't telephone me.
No, *** you, girl I'm going out. 
I gave you my all, 
But our love hit a wall, 
Now, I'm jingle belling and everyone's yelling
We'll drink 'til the bars shut us down.
Ain't that just what Christmas is all about?

And I hope you're happy with yourself, 
'Cause I'm not laughing, (not laughing)
Don't you think it's so damn trashy
What you did this holiday? 
(So trashy)
I gave you my heart, (heart)
You ripped it apart
Like the wrapping paper trash (wrapping paper trash)
So I wrote you a song, 
Hope that you sing along, 
Here it goes, 
"Merry Christmas, (bitch), ***."
