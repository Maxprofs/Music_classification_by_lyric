                        Bài hát: It’s Christmas Time Again - Backstreet Boys

Frost grows outside the window
First kiss under the mistletoe
oh oh oh oh
Bells Chime inside a steeple
Open the door see the people sing
oh oh oh oh

Chorus:
And when the snow is falling down down down
you'll know that Santa's back in town town town
That's when its Christmas time again
la ta la ta dada ta (2x)
It's Christmas time again
la ta la ta dada ta (2x)
It's christmas time again

I've been checking my list twice
got plans to give you your gift tonight
oh oh oh oh
Wake up under a lit tree
one wish that came true, your here with me
oh oh oh oh
(yeah)

Chorus:
And when the snow is falling down down down
you'll know that Santa's back in town town town
That's when its Christmas time again
la ta la ta dada ta (2x)
It's Christmas time again
la ta la ta dada ta (2x)
It's Christmas time again

And when the snow is falling down down down
you'll know that Santa's back in town town town
That's when its Christmas time again (yeah)
la ta la ta dada ta (I give you I give you my heart)
la ta la ta dada ta
It's Christmas time again (its Christmas)
la ta la ta dada ta (2x)
It's Christmas time again

I've been bad
I've been good
I've been everything I should
It's Christmas time again
I've been bad
I've been good
and you know I do what I should
It's Christmas time again.
