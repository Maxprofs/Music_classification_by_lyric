                        It's just, it's just
 I can't seem to fall asleep these days
 And you can't seem to stop digging this grave

 'Cause you were only eighteen at the time
 And I was holding up these streets just fine
 Come on, oh, come on

 Place me on your scene and lie fate
 Well everything that you ever said to me
 No, it wasn't just words
 (No, it wasn't just words)
 But day after day after day I called out fate

 Oh, darling I've been thinking about you
 And you are thinking how much farther it was
 It's filling up our lives

 Don't you just see what's happened?
 That we never stay away, come on

 Place me on your scene and lie fate
 Well everything that you ever said to me
 No, it wasn't just words
 (No, it wasn't just words)
 But day after day after day I called out

 (I can barely see the...)
 Place me on your scene and lie fate
 Staring at the scenery, wait 'til, just wait 'til
 Well everything that you ever said to me
 No, it wasn't just words
 (No, it wasn't just words)
 (Staring at the scenery)
 Day after day after day I called out

 (I can barely see the...)
 Place me on your scene and lie fate
 (Staring at the scenery)
 Well everything that you ever said to me
 No, it wasn't just words
 (No, it wasn't just words)
 (Staring at the scenery)
 Day after day after day I called out fate
                        
                    |
