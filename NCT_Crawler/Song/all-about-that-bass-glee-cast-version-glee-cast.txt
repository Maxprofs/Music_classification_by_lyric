Because you know

But I can (shake it, shake it) like I'm supposed to do
Cause I got that (boom-boom) that all them boys chase
And (all the right junk in all the right places)
I see the magazines (Ah-ah)
Working that Photoshop (Ah-ah)
We know that this ain't real

She says (boys like a little more booty to hold at night)
That booty, booty
