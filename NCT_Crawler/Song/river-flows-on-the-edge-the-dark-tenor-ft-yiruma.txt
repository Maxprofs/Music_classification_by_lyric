                        Bài hát: River Flows On The Edge - The Dark Tenor, Yiruma

The time has come
To let all your fears pass by
Your no man's land

Has turned to what you stand for

Welcome to your new life
In eternal sunlight
Spread your wings to new heights
Only you will decide what is next to become
On the edge, On the edge

Lost days have gone
With all your pain left inside
Your daydreams have
Turned to what you stand for

Welcome to your new life
In eternal sunlight
Spread your wings to new heights
Only you will decide what is next to become
On the edge, On the edge
                        
                    |
