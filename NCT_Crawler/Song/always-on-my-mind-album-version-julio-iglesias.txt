                        Bài hát: Always On My Mind (Album Version) - Julio Iglesias

Maybe I didn't love you
Quite as often as I could have
Maybe I didn't treat you
Quite as good as I should have

If I made you feel second best
I'm so sorry I was blind
You were always on my mind
You were always on my mind

Maybe I didn't hold you
All those lonely, lonely times
I guess I've never told you
I'm so happy that you're mine

Little things I should have said and done
I just never took the time
But you were always on my mind
You were always on my mind

Tell me, tell me that your sweet love hasn't died
And give me, one more chance
To keep you satisfied
I'll keep you satisfied

Little things I should have said and done
I just never took the time
But you were always on my mind
You were always on my mind

You were always on my mind
You were always on my mind
                        
                    |
