Duffy - Serious
[00:-1.00]

Serious
Serious

I'm a trophy on your arm,
You wear me like a charm,
Yes you do.
An accessory that suits,
Your new suede boots,
ohhh

I get a feeling deep down, inside,
Something just aint right.
I get a feeling that tells me I know,
Baby you never show...

How you really feel for me
Tell me, can we ever be,
Serious? Serious in love?

A joke on my expense,
In front of all your friends,
All the time.
A game you like to play,
Leaves me solo,
every day.

I get a feeling deep down inside,
Something just aint right.
I get a feeling that tells me I know,
Baby you never show...

How you really feel for me
Tell me can we ever be,
Serious? Serious in love?

Serious? Serious in Love?

I get a feeling deep down inside ,
That something just ain't right.
I get a feeling that tells me I know,
Baby you never show...

How you really feel for me,
Tell me, can we ever be, tell me,
Serious? Serious in love?

Serious,
So Serious
Serious
So Serious
Break it down
Serious
Baby
Serious
