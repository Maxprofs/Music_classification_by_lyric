Don't Live A life 
This Is your one life 
Don't live A life 
You won't get lost 
Just walk , just walk 

It's a liberty walk 
It's a liberty walk 
It's a liberty , liberty ,liberty 
It's a libery walk 
It's a liberty walk 
It's a liberty ,liberty,liberty 

Here's for all the boys tyring to hold you back 
Trying to make you like you're less than that 
Give them nothing more better than to make you crack 
But really just try to put your dreams ,on track 
And you know in the end it'll be okay 
Cause allit really matters are the steps you take 
And every thing else falls in the place 
There's no backing down isay 
We're all right yeah,yeah 
We're gonna get it when we leave it 
We're All right yeah,yeah 
We're gonna get it when we leave it 

It's a liberty walk, walk 
Say goodbye to the 
People who tied you up 
It's a liberty walk, walk 
Feeling your heart again, 
Breathing new oxygen 
It's a liberty walk, walk 
Free yourselve slam the door
not a prisoner anymore

Liberty, liberty, li-li-liberty, liberty, li-li-liberty 
It's a liberty walk 
(Don't Stop keep on walking in it) 
(Don't Stop keep on walking in it) 
(Don't Stop keep on walking in it) 
(Don't stop just keep the liberty walk,walk,walk,walk) 
Don't be afraid to make a move at all 
You just do what you were born to do 
And every thing else will play 
Don't listen to all the people who hate 
All they do is make your mistakes for you 
But they don't own ya, I just told ya 
We're all right yeah,yeah 
We're gonna get it when we leave it 
All right yeah,yeah 
We're gonna get it when we leave it 

It's a liberty walk, walk 
Say goodbye to the 
People who tied you up 
It's a liberty walk, walk 
Feeling your heart again, 
Breathing new oxygen 
It's a liberty walk, walk 
Free yourselve slam the door
not a prisoner anymore 

Liberty, liberty, li-li-liberty, liberty, li-li-liberty 
It's a liberty walk 
(Don't Stop just keep on walking) 
Walk this way 
(Don't Stop keep on talking ***) 
don't like, don't like, don't like 
don't like what you do 
Don't take the abuse 
I move to the true
People come on up in town 

It's a liberty walk, walk 
Say goodbye to the 
People who tied you up 
It's a liberty walk, walk 
Feeling your heart again, 
Breathing new oxygen 
It's a liberty walk, walk 
Free yourselve slam the door
not a prisoner anymore 

Liberty, liberty, li-li-liberty, liberty, li-li-liberty 
It's a liberty walk 
(Don't Stop just keep on walking) 
(Don't Stop keep on walking in it)
(Don't stop just keep the liberty walk,walk,walk,walk) 
(Don't Stop keep on walking in it)
