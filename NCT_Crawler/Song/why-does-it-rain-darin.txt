                        Bài hát: Why Does It Rain - Darin

I can't believe she's gone
I can't believe, that we're not together anymore
Something in her eyes, I've never seen before
It took me by surprise, when she said : I'm not in love anymore
Oh, baby
I keep holdin' on, can't let go
Please let me know ..

Why does it rain?
why does it hurt?
Please God explain, 'cause I don't understand
Love made me fly, now I just cry
Please tell me why, (oh, my baby)
why does it rain?

We used to be as one , we never were apart (no)
The sun was always shinin' in my heart
Now those days are gone, I miss the love we had
No-one ever told me, life could be so sad
Oh, baby
I keep holdin' on, can't let go
Please let me know ..

Why does it rain?
why does it hurt?
Please God explain,
'cause I don't understand
Love made me fly, now I just cry
Please tell me why, (oh, tell me)
why does it rain?

(ooh, ooh, ooh)
(oh, my baby)
(oohoohooo)
I keep holdin' on, can't let go
Please let me know ..

Ooh, why does it rain?
why does it hurt?
Please God explain, 'cause I don't understand
Love made me fly, now I just cry
Please tell me why
Why does it rain?
(why does it hurt?)
Please God explain, 'cause I don't understand
Love made me fly, (ooh, ooh)
(now I just cry)
Please tell me why, (ooh, noo)
why does it rain?
