                        Bài hát: Holiday - HRVY, Redfoo

[Music]
I met this girl on a Monday
She took my heart like a valley
Then like a bird,
She can fly away
And now everyday's like a holiday

[Chorus]
And we'll sit in the sun, our date together
Flip flop, coco butter music everyday
Sunshine beaches
And we'll pretend
Our love forever

Holiday, here we go again
Holiday, and i be with you
Holiday, ~Oh Nah Nah Nah~
I love you like a holiday
And we'll sing

[Music]
I love you like a holiday

[Music]
I love you like a holiday

When i started with you
Everything was so simple, baby
Then i got your number
And i ask you if you would play
And i know it precious
Cause our time it's all let me love you
Like a holiday

[Chorus]
Holiday, here we go again
Holiday, and i be with you
Holiday, ~Oh Nah Nah Nah~
I love you like a holiday
And we'll sing

[Music]
I love you like a holiday

[Rap part]
Yao
When i walk the street,
All the girls drive by
And they go bee bee, bee bee
But when you and me,
They got really jealous
"Who the HELL is she"
~Yeah~
That's my baby, baby
My ice-cream, my favorite flavour
I said I'm a cinnamon roll
And when you give me that sugar
I got out control

[Chorus]
Holiday, here we go again
Holiday, and i be with you
Holiday, ~Oh Nah Nah Nah~
I love you like a holiday
1, 2, 3, let's go!!

[Music]
I love you like a holiday

Holiday, here we go again
Holiday, and i be with you
Holiday, ~Oh Nah Nah Nah~
I LOVE YOU LIKE A HOLIDAY !!!

[THE END]
