                        Beautiful girl 
Wherever you are
I knew when i saw you
You had opened the door
I knew that i'd loved again
After a long , long while
I'd loved again

You said " Hello"
And i turned to go
But something in your eyes
left my heart beating so
I just knew that i'd loved again
After a long , long while
I'd loved again

It was destiny's game
for when love finally came on
I rushed in line,
Only to find
That you were gone

Wherever you are,
I fear that i might
Have lost you forever
Like a song in the night
Now that i've loved again
After a long , long while
I've loved again

It was destiny's game
for when love finally came on
I rushed in line,
Only to find
That you were gone

beautifil girl,
I'll search on for you
'Til all of your loveliness
In my arms come true
You've made me love again
After along , long while
In love again
And i'm glad that
it's you , hooh - hooh
Hmmm...beautiful girl ...
