                        [Verse 1]
 Just a small town girl, livin' in a lonely world
 She took the midnight train goin' anywhere
 Just a city boy, born and raised in south Detroit
 He took the midnight train goin' anywhere

 [Verse 2]
 A singer in a smoky room
 A smell of wine and cheap perfume
 For a smile they can share the night
 It goes on and on and on and on

 [Chorus]
 Strangers waiting, up and down the boulevard
 Their shadows searching in the nights
 Streetlights people, living just to find emotion
 Hiding, somewhere in the night.

 [Verse 3]
 Working hard to get my fill,
 Everybody wants a thrill
 Payin' anything to roll the dice,
 Just one more time
 Some will win, some will lose
 Some are born to sing the blues
 Oh, the movie never ends
 It goes on and on and on and on

 [Chorus]
 Strangers waiting, up and down the boulevard
 Their shadows searching in the night
 Streetlights people, living just to find emotion
 Hiding, somewhere in the night.

 [Hook x3]
 Don't stop believin'
 Hold on to that feelin'
 Streetlights people
 Don't stop believin'
 Streetlights people
 Don't stop believin'
 Streetlights people
 Don't stop
                        
                    |
