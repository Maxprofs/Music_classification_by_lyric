                        Bài hát: Someone like you - Sissel

Swear I made up my mind when I saw you that first time
It's like you were sent from the sky
the kind of love you hear about
That you just can't do without
Baby that's you and I
Always believed there was something more
Through every empy hour I kept searching for

Someone like you who does everything the way that you do
Someone like you, baby no one holds a candle 
The only someone I want is you 

I've treasured this romance and hold you as we dance
our way through love's open doors
I've found my happiness within your sweet caress
Then I've ever known before

Something's fate won't let you leave behind
I could turn this world over but I'll never find

Someone like you who does everything the way that you do
Someone like you, baby no one holds a candle 
The only someone I want is you 

It's not like I've given up on life
Just because ive found this love
I've never felt something so right
Your love is a gift to my heart

Something's fate won't let you leave behind
I could turn this world over but I'll never find

Someone like you who does everything the way that you do
Someone like you, baby no one holds a candle 
The only someone I want is you
                        
                    |
