                        I don't wanna go another day
 So I'm telling you exactly what is on my mind
 Seems like everybody is breaking up
 Throwing their love away
 But I know I got a good thing right here
 That's why I say [Hey]

 Nobody gonna love me better
 I'ma stick wit you
 Forever
 Nobody gonna take me higher
 I'ma stick wit you
 You know how to appreciate me
 I'ma stick wit you
 My baby
 Nobody ever made me feel this way
 I'ma stick wit you

 I don't wanna go another day
 So I'm telling you exactly what is on my mind
 See the way we ride
 In our private lives
 Ain't nobody getting in between
 I want you to know that you're the only one for me [one for me]
 What I'm saying

 Nobody gonna love me better
 I'ma stick wit you
 Forever
 Nobody gonna take me higher
 I'ma stick wit you [nobody]
 You know how to appreciate me
 I'ma stick wit you
 My baby
 Nobody ever made me feel this way
 I'ma stick wit you

 And now
 Ain't nothing else I can need [nothing else I can need]
 And now
 I'm singing 'cause you're so, so into me
 I got you
 We'll be making love endlessly
 I'm with you (Baby, I'm with you baby)
 Baby, you're with me (Baby, You're with me)

 So don't you worry about
 People hanging around
 They ain't bringing us down
 I know you and you know me
 And that's all that counts

 So don't you worry about
 People hanging around
 They ain't bringing us down
 I know you and you know me
 And that's, that's why I say, hey

 Nobody gonna love me better
 I'ma stick wit you
 Forever
 Nobody gonna take me higher
 I'ma stick wit you
 You know how to appreciate me
 I'ma stick wit you
 My baby
 Nobody ever made me feel this way
 I'ma stick wit you

 Nobody gonna love me better
 I'ma stick wit you
 Forever
 Nobody gonna take me higher
 I'ma stick wit you
 You know how to appreciate me
 I'ma stick wit you
 My baby
 Nobody ever made me feel this way
 I'ma stick wit you
