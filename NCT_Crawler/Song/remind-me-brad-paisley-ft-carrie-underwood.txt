                        [Brad] We didn't care if people stared
 We'd make out in a crowd somewhere
 Somebody'd tell us to get a room
 It's hard to believe that was me and you
 Now we keep saying that we're ok
 But I don't want to settle for good not great
 I miss the way that it felt back then I wanna feel that way again

Been so long that you'd forget the way I used to kiss your neck
 [Carrie] Remind me, remind me
 So on fire so in love. Way back when we couldn't get enough
 [Carrie] Remind me, remind me

[Carrie] Remember the airport dropping me off
 We were kissing goodbye and we couldn't stop
 [Brad] I felt bad cause you missed your flight
 [Carrie and Brad] But that meant we had one more night

[Carrie] Do you remember how it used to be
 we'd turn out the lights and didn't just sleep
 [Brad] Remind me Remind me
 Baby remind me
 [Carrie] Oh so on fire so in love
 that look in your eyes that I miss so much
 [Brad] Remind me, baby remind me

[Brad] I wanna feel that way
 [Carrie] Yeah I wanna hold you close
 [Brad and Carrie] Oh If you still love me
 Don't just assume I know

[Carrie] Do you remember the way it felt?
 [Brad] You mean back when we couldn't control ourselves
 [Carrie] Remind me, remind me
 [Brad] Yeah remind me
 [Carrie] All those things that you used to do
 That made me fall in love with you
 Remind me. Oh Baby Remind Me

[Brad] Yeah you'd wake up in my old t-shirt
 All those mornings I was late for work
 Remind me

[Brad and Carrie] Oh baby remind me

[Carrie] Oh, baby remind me, remind me
 [Brad] Yeah, you'd wake up in my old t-shirt
 Baby, remind me
