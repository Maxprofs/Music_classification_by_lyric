Massachusetts
Bee Gees
Feel I'm goin' back to Massachusetts,
Something's telling me I must go home.
And the lights all went out in Massachusetts
The day I left her standing on her own.
Tried to hitch a ride to San Francisco,
Gotta do the things I wanna do.
They brought me back to see my way with you.
Talk about the life in Massachusetts,
Speak about the people I have seen,
And Massachusetts is one place I have seen.
I will remember Massachusetts...
