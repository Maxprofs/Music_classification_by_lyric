                        Bài hát: Shy - Nightcore

Everytime you walk into the room got me feeling crazy, chock my heart boom 
boom. 
Any other boy would stare but me, I look away cause you're making me scared. 
Try not to breathe 1 2 3, try not to freak when you look at me. 
Gotta make you move but I freeze, you don't have a clue what you do to me. 
Girl, you make me shy, shy, shy. You make me run and hide, hide, hide. 
Feel like I get lost in time whenever you need me. 
Girl, you make me shy, shy, shy. I find the butterfli fli flies. 
Yeah, you make me lose my mind whenever you need me. 

Girl you make me shy. 

Rejection is a word that I don't wanna know but a girl like you could kill 
a boy real slow. 
A million words stuck up in my head waiting to be said but my tongue is 
stumbling. 
Try not to breathe 1 2 3, trying not to freak when you look at me. 
Try to make you move but I freeze, you don't have a clue what you do to me. 
Girl, you make me shy, shy, shy. You make me run and hide, hide, hide. 
Feel like I get lost in time whenever you need me. 
Girl, you make me shy, shy, shy. I find the butterfli fli flies. 
Yeah, you make me lose my mind whenever you need me. 
Girl, you take me high. I feel like I can fly. But I fall out of the sky. 
But I look into your eyes. 
Oh girl, you make me shy, shy, shy. You make me run and hide, hide, hide. 
Feel like I get lost in time whenever you need me. 
Girl, you make me shy, shy, shy. I find the butterfli fli flies. 
Yeah, you make me lose my mind whenever you need me. 
Girl, you make me shy. 
Girl, you make me shy. 
Can even talk to you? 
Girl, you make me shy.
