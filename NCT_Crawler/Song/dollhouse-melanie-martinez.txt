                        Hey girl, open the walls
Play with your dolls
We'll be a perfect family
When you walk away
It's when we really play
You don't hear me when I say
Mom, please wake up
Dad's with a slut
And the sun is smoking cannabis
No one ever listens
It's why our paper [?]
Don't laugh and see what goes down in the kitchen

Places, places
Getting you places
Throw out your dress and put on your dark faces
Everyone thinks that we're perfect
Please don't let them look through the curtains
Picture, picture, smile for the picture
Pose with your brother, won't you be a good sister?
Everyone thinks that we're perfect
Please don't let them look through the curtains

D-O-L-L-H-O-U-S-E
I see things that nobody else sees
D-O-L-L-H-O-U-S-E
I see things that nobody else sees


Hey girl, look at my mom
She's got it going on
Ha, you're blinded by her jewelry
When you turn your back
She pulls out her flask
And forgets her infedility
I hope she's coming to the alley plastic
Go back to being plastic
No one ever listens
It's why our paper [?]
Don't laugh and see what goes down in the kitchen

Places, places
Getting you places
Throw out your dress and put on your dark faces
Everyone thinks that we're perfect
Please don't let them look through the curtains
Picture, picture, smile for the picture
Pose with your brother, won't you be a good sister?
Everyone thinks that we're perfect
Please don't let them look through the curtains

D-O-L-L-H-O-U-S-E
I see things that nobody else sees
D-O-L-L-H-O-U-S-E
I see things that nobody else sees

Hey girl
Hey girl, open the walls
Play with your dolls
We'll be a perfect family

Places, places
Getting you places
Throw out your dress and put on your dark faces
Everyone thinks that we're perfect
Please don't let them look through the curtains
Picture, picture, smile for the picture
Pose with your brother, won't you be a good sister?
Everyone thinks that we're perfect
Please don't let them look through the curtains

D-O-L-L-H-O-U-S-E
I see things that nobody else sees
D-O-L-L-H-O-U-S-E
I see things that nobody else sees
