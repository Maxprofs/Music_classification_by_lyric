                        Come with me
stay the night
you say the words but boy it don't feel right
what do you expect me to say?
You know it's just too little too late
You take my hand
and you say you've changed
but boy you know your begging don't fool me
because to you it's just a game
You know it's just too little too late

So let me on down
cause time has made me strong
I'm starting to move on
I'm gonna say this now
your chance has come and gone
and you know

It's just too little too late
a little too wrong
and I can't wait
boy you know all the right things to say
you know it's just too little too late
You say you dream of my face
but you don't like me
you just like the chase
to be real it doesn't matter anyways
You know it's just too little too late

yeah yeah it's just too little too late

I was young and in love
I gave you everything but it wasn't enough
and now you wanna communicate
You know it's just too little too late

Go find someone else
in letting you go I'm loving myself
you got a problem
but don't come asking me for help
Cause you know

It's just too little too late
a little too wrong
and I can't wait
boy you know all the right things to say
you know it's just too little too late
You say you dream of my face
but you don't like me
you just like the chase
to be real it doesn't matter anyways
You know it's just too little too late

I can love with all of my heart baby
I know I have so much to give(I have so much to give)
with a player like you I don't have a prayer
That's the way to live

Oooh no it's just too little too late yeah

It's just too little too late
a little too wrong
and I can't wait
boy you know all the right things to say
you know it's just too little too late
You say you dream of my face
but you don't like me
you just like the chase
to be real it doesn't matter anyways
You know it's just too little too late
you know it's just too little too late

It's just too little too late
a little too wrong
and I can't wait
boy you know all the right things to say
you know it's just too little too late
You say you dream of my face
but you don't like me
you just like the chase
to be real it doesn't matter anyways
You know it's just too little too late
