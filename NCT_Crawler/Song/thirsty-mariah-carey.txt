                        Oh, you’re thirsty
Oh, you’re thirsty
Oh, you’re thirsty
Oh, you’re thirsty

You send the bright lights
Even change your name
Say you’re my boss now
Ain't nothing out your range
Well, almost anything

You used to be Mister all about me
Now you just thirsty for celebrity
Best thing that happened to your ass was me
Pull down them Tom Fords, and act like you see

You thirsty for a dream
Leaving me drowning
Boy there ain't no SOS
Filled with discontent
Finding you can’t quit
Why you try to so damn hard?

Oh, you’re thirsty
Oh, you’re thirsty
Oh, you’re thirsty

Oh, you’re thirsty
Oh, you’re thirsty
Oh, you’re thirsty

Calling you again
So you stunting on your Instagram
But that sh-t ain't everything.
You used to be Mr. all about we
Now you're just thirsty for celebrity
Best thing to happen to your ass was me
Pull down them Tom Fords, and act like you see

You thirsty for a dream, leaving me drowning
Boy there ain't no SOS
Filled with discontent
Finding you can’t quit
Why you try to so damn hard?

[Rich Homie Quan:]
Somebody get this girl a glass water
I say she six nickels, not a dime, past a quarter
Her daddy question me why she thirsty
You can ask your daughter, back up off
You look a little salty, so thirsty, should drink coffee
And you ain't really gotta keep hitting my phone, I see every message
Texting me asking where I'm going, baby girl stop stressin'
Then I walked in like the man of the year with these thirsty girls in my section
These thirsty girls want a blessin'
Get wet, you [?] for me
No defense but you can get the D
No sequal it's only one on me
That thirsty [?] my tires
It got me on fire
Rich Homie Quan times Mariah, Sing!

Boss now, you're trying to be a boss now
Thinking you a boss now
Boy you just looking thirsty
Boss now, you try to be a boss now
Thinking you a chief now
Boy you're just *** thirsty

Oh, you’re thirsty
Oh, you’re thirsty
Oh, you’re thirsty

Oh, you’re thirsty
Oh, you’re thirsty
Oh, you’re thirsty
