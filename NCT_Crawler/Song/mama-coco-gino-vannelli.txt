                        Mama Coco, hey you're lookin' heavy
 Mama Coco, ho you're lookin' good
 Mama Coco, yes I've been getting hungry
 Mama Coco, feed me woman food
 Mama Coco I don't have fancy shacks or multi-colored Cadillacs
 But I have three months of loneliness
 So Mama, have a drink, relax
 Mama, Mama, so glad to have you here
 I love you, love you, Mama Coco Mama Coco, such anticipation
 Mama Coco, mam you're blowin' my mind
 Mama Coco, I'm just a male Caucasian
 Mama Coco, I'm virgin to your kind
 Mama Coco I don't get paranoid
 I ain't a horny little mongoloid
 All I wanna, wanna, wanna have
 Is a little bit of love and joy Mama, Mama, so glad to have you here
 I love you, love you, love you, love you, Mama Coco
 Mama Mama, Mama, so glad to have you here
 I love you, love you, love you, love you, Mama Coco Mama Coco
 Mama Coco, hey you're lookin' heavy
 Mama Coco, ho you're lookin' good
 Mama Coco, Mama Coco, Mama Coco
