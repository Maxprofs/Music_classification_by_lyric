                        The sun, the moon, the sky up above, my dear
A day, a week, a month, or even a year
I'll give you all that you want and all that you need
from my heart to your heart
this is how you make me feel

My love, my love, my love
I'll give it all to you
My love, my love, my love
'cause my heart so true
My love, my love, my love
I'll give you everything
And giving is the greatest gift of all
So I couldn't ask for anything more my love

A smile, a laugh, a hand to hold my dear
A hope, a wish, a life with nothing to fear
I'll give you all that you want and all that you need
from my heart to your heart
this is how you make me feel

My love, my love, my love
I'll give it all to you
My love, my love, my love
'cause my heart so true
My love, my love, my love
I'll give you everything
And giving is the greatest gift of all
So I couldn't ask for anything more my love

Tell me what you wish for
Oh anything your heart desires
Anything at all

My love, my love, my love
I'll give it all to you
My love, my love, my love
'cause my heart so true
My love, my love, my love
I'll give you everything
And giving is the greatest gift of all
So I coulnd't ask for anything more than your love
                        
                    |
