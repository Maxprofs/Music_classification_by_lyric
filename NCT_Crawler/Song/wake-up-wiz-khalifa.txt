                        Wake up, wake up, I don’t wanna wake up, wake up.
Wake up, wake up, I don’t wanna wake up, wake up.

Get on straight never switch lane...’cause it’s hard not to see
I came up in a big way and I hardly ever sleep well it’s like a dream
I don’t wanna wake up from, don’t wanna wake up from
I don’t wanna wake up from, don’t wanna wake up from

Ohh, long days, what I know hard work place
All the money getting long to
And the cush male strong too,
that’s that good any chick ...need a .. too
one thing I know is go hard young make fake niggas know this
blowing money ‘cause you die if you don’t live
that’s how you know I was fly when I wrote this
first class tax or maybe I’m the first ‘cause it’s my first class swag
..i was dripin’ ....

Chorus:
Get on straight never switch lane...’cause it’s hard not to see

I came up in a big way and I hardly ever sleep well it’s like a dream
I don’t wanna wake up from, don’t wanna wake up from
I don’t wanna wake up from, don’t wanna wake up from.
Go hard young, go hard.. let you in the game better play your part
Go hard young, go hard and if you win the game as well place smart
‘cause I’ve seen niggas fall like paper, got money scene friend turn haters
Got money ..turn major, got money why people turn neighbors
Me to girl teach her how to roll papers, six months three place
.... run my town like the .. run my town b*tch like a ..

[Chorus:]

I can take you up higher than you ever know
..what you want ..let go, hell no
...

[2 x Chorus:]
