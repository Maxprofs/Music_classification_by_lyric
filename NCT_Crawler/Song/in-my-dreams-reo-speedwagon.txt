                        There was a time
 Some time ago
 When every sunrise meant
 A sunny day, oh a sunny day But now when
 The morning light shines in
 It only disturbs the dreamland
 Where I lay, oh where I lay I used to thank the lord when I'd wake
 For life and love and the golden sky above me
 But now I pray the stars will go on shinin'
 You see in my dreams you love me Daybreak is a joyful time
 Just listen to the songbird
 Harmonies, oh the harmonies But I wish the dawn
 Would never come
 I wish there was silence
 In the trees, oh the trees If only I could stay asleep
 At least I could pretend
 You're thinkin' of me
 'Cause night time is
 The one time I am happy
 You see in my dreams We climb and climb and at the top we fly
 Let the world go on below us, we are lost in time
 And I don't know really what it means
 All I know is that you love me, in my dreams I keep hopin' one day I'll awaken
 And somehow she'll be lying by my side
 And as I wonder if the dawn is really breakin'
 She touches me and suddenly I'm alive We climb and climb and at the top we fly
 Let the world go on below us, we are lost in time
 And I don't know really what it means
 All I know is that you love me, in my dreams We climb and climb and at the top we fly
 Let the world go on below us, we are lost in time
 And I don't know really what it means
 All I know is that you love me, in my dreams
 Oh, in my dreams
                        
                    |
