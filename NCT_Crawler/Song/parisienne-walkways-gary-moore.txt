                        (Gary Moore/Philip Lynott) I remember Paris in '49.
 The Champs Elysee, Saint Michel,
 and old Beaujolais wine.
 And I recall that you were mine
 in those Parisienne days. Looking back at the photographs.
 Those summer days spent outside corner cafes.
 Oh, I could write you paragraphs,
 about my old Parisienne days.
