                        Bài Hát: Let Me Love You (Until You Learn to Love Yourself)
Trình Bày: Ne-Yo 

Much as you blame yourself
You can't be blamed for the way that you feel

Had no example of a love that
 was even remotely real .... ..
How can you understand something
 that you never had ... ..
Ooh baby if you let me,
I can help you out with all of that

Girl let me love you ...
And I will love you ...
Until you learn ...
to love yourself ...
Girl let me love you ...
And all your trouble ...
Don't be afraid ...
girl let me help

Girl let me love you ...
And I will love you ...
Until you learn ...
to love yourself ...
Girl let me love you ...
A heart of numbness ...
Comes back to light ...
I'll take you there

Girl let me love you
Let me love you baby,

Girl let me love you
Let me love you baby

Girl let me love you
Let me love you, 
let me love you

I can see the pain behind your eyes
It been there for some while .....
I just wanna be the one 
to remind you 
What it is to smile

I would like to show 
you what true love can really do

Girl let me love you ...
And I will love you ...
Until you learn ...
to love yourself ...
Girl let me love you ...
And all your trouble ...
Don't be afraid ...
girl let me help

Girl let me love you ...
And I will love you ...
Until you learn ...
 to love yourself ...
Girl let me love you ...
A heart of numbness ...
Comes back to light ...
I'll take you there

Girl let me love you baby
Girl let me love you
Girl Let me love you baby,
Girl let me love you

Girl Let me love you baby
Girl let me love you
Let me love you
Girl Let me love you baby

For every heart that beats ...
heart that beats

Girl let me love you ...
And I will love you ...
Until you learn ...
to love yourself ...
Girl let me love you ...
And all your trouble ...
Don't be afraid ...
girl let me help

Girl let me love you ...
And I will love you ...
Until you learn ...
to love yourself ...
Girl let me love you ...
A heart of numbness ...
Comes back to light ...
I'll take you there

Girl let me love you ... ...
Let me love you baby,
 love you baby
Girl let me love you
Let me love you baby,
 love you baby
