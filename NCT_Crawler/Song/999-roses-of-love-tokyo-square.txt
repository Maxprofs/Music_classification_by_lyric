                        Bài hát: 999 Roses Of Love - Tokyo Square

I feel so blue oh when I'm not with you
Thinking of you is the best thing I can do
Just loving you it's what I wanna do
Baby won't you just come love me too

When I meet you I just know that is you
And I can feel something special that's in you
Looking at you I just fall in love
You're the one that I want in my life

I give you anything dear 
As long as you're here right beside me
No matter where you go now
I know I want you to be with you
I assure you'll we'll be happy
Come on now and give your love right to me
                        
                    |
