                        Nat king cole I was walking along, minding my business
 When out of an orange-colored sky
 Flash! bam! alakazam!
 Wonderful you came by I was humming a tune, drinking in sunshine
 When out of that orange-colored view
 Wham! bam! alakazam!
 I got a look at you One look and I yelled "timber"
 "watch out for flying glass"
 'cause the ceiling fell and the bottom fell out
 I went into a spin and I started to shout,
 "i've been hit, this is it, this is it!" I was walking along minding my business
 When love came and hit me in the eye
 Flash! bam! alakazam!
 Out of an orange-colored sky.
