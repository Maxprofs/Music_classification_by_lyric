                        Bài hát: Got Love - Tove Lo

When I breathe then I breathe into you and I feel you right to the bone
And I give what you give and we go even higher than we are strong
And the cracks in the walls covered up by the sheets we live underneath
All the sex, all the nights we stay up yeah we're stuck but we're more than free
Ooooh aaaah oooooh aaaaah
Got the world in our hand like a land

[Chorus x2:]
Got enough to make the ocean look like it's a pond
Got enough to turn the valleys into mountaintops
And we live like legends now, know that we'll never die
We got love, we got love

I can feel that you feel what I feel and I feel it all in your hands
When we touch it's too much and you're making me move, yeah, now make me dance
Going body to body for good saying nobody get's it right
We don't plan, we don't care, got the fume and the flame, we don't let it die
Ooooh aaaah oooooh aaaaah
Got the world in our hand like a land

[Chorus x2]

Perfect like a picture
I know we are one in the same
Perfect like a picture
Even when they look through the grains

[Chorus x2]
                        
                    |
