                        Bài hát: This Little Girl - Nightcore

You got your keys, but where you going?
The third degree just isn't working. 
'Cause you walked out without asking me to go, 
And if I followed you home, would you be alone?

I checked your phone, 'cause it was beeping
Are you alone? I know you're creepin'
'Cause you walked out without asking me to go, 
But if I followed you home, I hope you're alone

Bridge: 
I'm three steps from the edge
Whoa-oh
Don't push me over it
Don't you know, don't you know

Chorus: 
Every girl is capable of murder if you hurt her
Watch out you, don't push me any further, any further
You're not the only one walkin' 'round with a loaded gun.
This little girl is capable of murder 'cause you hurt her

My hands are clean, not yet a killer
Ain't I your queen? And did you tell her?
'Cause you broke down all my shoulda known betters
And I followed you home, throwing sticks and stones 

Bridge:
I'm two steps from the edge
Whoa-oh
Don't push me over it
Don't you know, don't you know

Chorus:
Every girl is capable of murder if you hurt her
Watch out you, don't push me any further, any further
You're not the only one walkin' 'round with a loaded gun
This little girl is capable of murder 'cause you hurt her

Don't you know you should never treat a girl like that?
Got a good alibi, and my bag's all packed
Don't you know you should never treat a girl like that?
'Cause the next one's gonna have the hammer pulled back

Chorus: 
Every girl is capable of murder 
So watch out you, don't push me any further
But you f*ckin' hurt her

Every girl is capable of murder if you hurt her
Watch out, you don't push me any further, any further
You're not the only one walkin' 'round with a loaded gun
This little girl is capable of murder, hey! 
This little girl is capable of murder 'cause you hurt her!
