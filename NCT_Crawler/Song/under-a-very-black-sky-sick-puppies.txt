                        I had a dream
 You had a weapon
 I couldn't see it in the dark of the night
 It is easy to hide under a very black sky
 Over the moon just beyond sudden
 I watched in vain as the missiles took flight
 We lost our lives under a very black sky Under a black sky Colors explode under your microscope
 but just through my eyes it is all black and white
 I lost my mind under a very black sky
 We live our lives mostly pretending
 You have a secret, you'll never know mine
 I'll wear my disguise under a very black sky Its easy to love you, easy as hell
 When you're anyone, anyone else
 It is so hard to fake it, I know you can tell
 If you're anyone, anyone else Under a black sky At first you believe, and then you start lying
 Swallowing pain likes its shredded up glass
 I'm bleeding inside under a very black sky
 Disappointment is cruel, but hope can be crueler
 I have felt them both until I thought I could die
 Now all my tears are dry under a very black sky Under a black sky
                        
                    |
