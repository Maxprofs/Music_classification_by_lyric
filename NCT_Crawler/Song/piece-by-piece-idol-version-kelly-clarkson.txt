                        Bài hát: Piece By Piece - Kelly Clarkson

And all I remember is your back
Walking towards the airport leaving us all in your past
I traveled 1500 miles to see you
Begged you to want me
But you didn't want to

But piece by piece he collected me
Up off the ground where you abandoned things, and
Piece by piece he filled the holes that you burned in me
At six years old and now
He never walks away
He never asks for money
He takes care of me
He loves me
Piece by piece
He restored my faith
That a man can be kind
And a father could stay

And all of your words fall flat
I made something of myself and now you wanna come back
But your love, it isn't free
It has to be earned
Back then I didn't have anything you needed
So I was worthless

But piece by piece he collected me
Up off the ground where you abandoned things, and
Piece by piece he filled the holes that you burned in me
At six years old and no
He never walks away
He never asks for money
He takes care of me
'Cause he loves me
Piece by piece
He restored my faith
That a man can be kind
And a father could stay

Piece by Piece... (x6)

Piece by piece I fell far from the tree
I would never leave her like you left me
And she will never have to wonder her worth
Because unlike you I'm gonna put her first, and know
He'll never walk away
He'll never break her heart
He'll take care of things
He'll love her
Piece by piece
He restored my faith
That a man can be kind
And a father should be great

Piece by Piece...
