Kanji Lyrics 歌詞

それでもきっと間違っていないよね
私たちの Story
今までもこれからも 迷いながら
Just let it go


“あの日に戻りたい”って
もう何年前だっけ?
気づけば遠い昔の話で

Uh 愛想笑いを磨いて
Uh バカなことは諦めて
大人にならなきゃいけないのかな

お互い他人の夢なら
応援できるのにね
Oh Yeah
I just don't know why

それでもきっと間違っていないよね
私たちの Story
未来のほんの一部が見えなくて
Give up, Never, Give up
繰り返して Try
磨かれる Style
いつか本当の夢を
見つけるその日まで Trying Trying
何度でも So just let it go

“幸せになりたい”って
もう何回目だっけ?
気づけば同じ失敗話で

Uh 会いたい気持ち隠して
Uh ワガママなんて言わないで
大人にならなきゃいけないのかな

お互い他人の恋なら
冷静になれるのにね
Oh Yeah
I just don't know why

それでもきっと間違っていないよね
私たちの Story
心のほんの一部が痛いだけ
Hello, Goodbye, Hello
繰り返して Cry
強くなる Heart
いつか本当の恋を
見つけるその日まで Crying Crying
何度でも So just let it go

I don't know what should I do
I don't know what I want to do
どこへ向かうの?この先は
Nobody knows the way it's gonna be
Everything depends on me
この手で 全てを 描いてく Story

笑顔も涙もキレイな思い出も
私たちの Story
まだまだ続きがあるから悲しみに
Goodbye, All right, All right
Just let it go

それでもきっと間違っていないよね
私たちの Story
未来のほんの一部が見えなくて
Give up, Never, Give up
繰り返して Try
磨かれる Style
いつか本当の私を
見つけるその日まで Trying Trying
何度でも So just let it go
Just let it go
Just let it go

English Translation Lyrics

Still I'm surely not wrong
the story of us
Even now, while I'm lost in the furure
Just let it go

“You said I want to return”
For many years ago, you remember me?
I noticed in the story of yours long ago

Uh brushing up my fake smile
Uh so fool to give up
I wonder should I be an adult?

If you dream of having each others
I wish you can support it
Oh Yeah
I just don't know why

Still I'm surely not wrong
the story of us
the're things that's not visible in the future
Give up, Never, Give up
Repeating it, Try
to be polished with Style
Someday dreams will come true
Just keep on Trying Trying until you find it
For many times, So just let it go

“What I want to be happy”
How many times was that it?
I noticed there's always failure in the same story

Uh there are hidden feelings that I want to see
Uh this selfishness just don't say it
I wonder should I be an adult?

If you love of having each others
I get used to be calm
Oh Yeah
I just don't know why

Still I'm surely not wrong
the story of us
it only hurts just little fraction in my heart
Hello, Goodbye, Hello
Repeating it just Cry
I become stonger by Heart
Someday there will be true love
I'll be Crying Crying until I find it
For many times, So just let it go

I don't know what should I do
I don't know what I want to do
Where are you going? on this journey
Nobody knows the way it's gonna be
Everything depends on me
All would be painted in this hand like a Story

Tears & laughter, beautiful memories
the story of us
still continuing in sorrow of being distant but it's over
Goodbye, All right, All right
Just let it go

Still I'm surely not wrong
the story of us
the're things that's not visible in the future
Give up, Never, Give up
Repeating it, Try
to be polished with Style
Someday the real me
would keep on Trying Trying until I find it
For many times, So just let it go
Just let it go
Just let it go
                        
                    |
