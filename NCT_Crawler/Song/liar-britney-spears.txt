                        Bài Hát: Liar - Britney Spears

[Verse 1]
Tall tale, such a damn shame
Hindsight, I can see it all so plain
Kamikaze fire come down
Fire come down, fire-fire come down
Left, right, nowhere to turn
I'm left in the ash from the bridges you burned
Kamikaze fire come down
Fire come down, fire-fire come down

[Pre-Chorus]
(ah) It's too late for apologies
(ah) Nothing you can offer me now
(ah) I'm looking at you on your knees
(ah) And I'm all listened out
[Chorus]
Crawl, crawl, crawl
But I'm never coming down
Baby cry, cry, cry
You ain't fooling anyone
You know I know that you know I know
That you're a liar, a liar
You can crawl, crawl, crawl
You can beg and you can bleed
Baby talk, talk, talk
Keep on lying through your teeth
You know I know that you know I know
That you're a liar, a liar

[Verse 2]
I hear you all night talk in your sleep
Saying all kind of things but none of them read
Keeping secrets under your sheets
Under you sheets, under-under your sheets
You can cry wolf
But you know I ain't gonna be here tomorrow, oh no
I ain't *** with you dirty, dirty, dirty laundry
Dirty laundry, dirty-dirty laundry

[Pre-Chorus]
(ah) It's too late for apologies
(ah) Nothing you can offer me now
(ah)I'm looking at you on your knees
(ah) And I'm all listened out

[Chorus]
Crawl, crawl, crawl
But I'm never coming down
Baby cry, cry, cry
You ain't fooling anyone
You know I know that you know I know
That you're a liar, a liar
You can crawl, crawl, crawl
You can beg and you can bleed
Baby talk, talk, talk
Keep on lying through your teeth
You know I know that you know I know
That you're a liar, a liar

[Bridge]
So here we go
Wo-wo-wo-wo-wo-wo
Wo-wo-wo-wo-wo-wo
So here we go
Wo-wo-wo-wo-wo-wo
Here we go (You're a liar, liar)

[Chorus]
You can crawl, crawl, crawl
But I'm never coming down
Baby cry, cry, cry
You ain't fooling anyone
You know I know that you know I know
That you're a liar, a liar
You can crawl, crawl, crawl
You can beg and you can bleed
Baby talk, talk, talk
Keep on lying through your teeth
You know I know that you know I know
That you're a liar, a liar

So here we go
Wo-wo-wo-wo-wo-wo
Wo-wo-wo-wo-wo-wo
Wo-wo-wo-wo-wo-wo
You're a liar, a liar
