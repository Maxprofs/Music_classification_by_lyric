                        Bài hát: I'm In Love - Alexander Rybak

No matter what they say - now I'm in love
I do it my way - cause I'm in love
And I can keep that song out of my mind
Playing that silly tune - all the time

La da da da da
I'm in love

No matter what they say - I don't care
I do it anyway - anywhere
I found this little song on my own
She said that I'm a genius - I'm in love

My friends say that I'm crazy - I'm just fine
My neighbors stare at me - Never mind
Cause everytime this sweetness of her smile
My supersonic girl - I'm in love

No matter what they say - now I'm in love
I do it my way - cause I'm in love
And I can keep that song out of my mind
Playing that silly tune - all the time

La da da da da
I'm in love

No matter what they say - I don't care
I do it anyway - anywhere
I found this little song on my own
She said that I'm a genius - I'm in love

My friends say that I'm crazy - I'm just fine
My neighbors stare at me - Never mind
Cause everytime this sweetness of her smile
My supersonic girl - I'm in love

No matter what they say - now I'm in love
I do it my way - cause I'm in love
And I can keep that song out of my mind
Playing that silly tune - all the time

I'm in love

My friends say that I'm crazy - I'm just fine
My neighbors stare at me - Never mind
Cause everytime this sweetness of her smile
My supersonic girl - I'm in love

I'm in love
I'm in love
