                        [Verse:]
 I keep on fallin'... In--- and out of love with you
 Sometimes I love ya, sometimes you make me blue
 Sometimes I feel good, At times I feel used
 Lovin' you darlin', makes me so confused

 [Chorus:]
 I keep on fallin', in and out of love with you
 I never loved someone the way that I'm lovin' you

 [Verse 2:]
 Oh Oh, I... Never felt this way
 How do you give me so much pleasure,
 And cause me so much pain(yea-ea, yea-ea)
 Just when I think I've taken more than would a fool
 I start on fallin back in love with you

 [Chorus:]
 I keep on fallin', in and out of love with-a you
 I never loved someone the way that I'm lovin' you

 (Bridge)Oh baby
 I, I, I, I'm
 Fa-a-allin'
 I, I, I, I'm
 Fa-a-allin'
 Fall, fall, fa-a-a-allin'x2

 O-o-o-o-oh o-o-o-o-o-oh

 (Chorus X 4)
 I'm keep on fallin', in and out of love with-a you
 I never loved someone the way that I'm lovin' you

 I'm fallin', in and out of love with-a you
 I never loved someone the way that I'm lovin' you

 I'm fallin', in and out of love with-a you
 I never loved someone the way that I'm lovin' you

 I'm fallin', in and out of love with-a you
 I never loved someone the way that I'm lovin' you
                        
                    |
