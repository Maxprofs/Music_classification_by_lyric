                        Bài Hát: Last kiss goodbye - Nathan Lee, Thu Minh

Do you still remember how we kissed 
The tenderness that I used to miss
The temptation I can’t resist

Yes, I still remember everytime
My lips are yours and yours will all mine
It’s still so long but can we try ?

So kiss one more time
What care about tomorrow?
When I’m gone and where you will go?
Just give it a try
Remember that sweet moment
For tonight you’re forever mine
Last kiss goodbye

I will never feel this way again
The happiness within this pain
Those memories your lips remain
I know it is crazy but it’s true
You must think that I’m just a fool
But every kisses remind me of you

Kiss me one more time
With all you have in your soul
Be with me wherever you go
Just give it a try
Remember that sweet moment
For tonigh you’re forever mine
Last kiss goodbye

Kiss me one more time
With all you have in your soul
Be with me wherever you go
Just give it a try
Remember that sweet moment
For tonight you’re forever mine
Last kiss goodbye 

Yes, I still remember everytime
My lips are yours and yours are mine
Just give me one last kiss goodbye
