                        When I get older
 I will be stronger
 They'll call me freedom
 Just like a wavin' flag(x2)

 And then it goes back (x3)
 Oh

 Born to a throne
 Stronger than Rome
 But violent prone
 Poor people zone
 But it's my home
 All I have known
 Where I got grown
 Streets we would roam

 Out of the darkness
 I came the farthest
 Among the hardest (survival)
 Learn from these streets
 It can be bleak
 Accept no defeat
 Surrender, retreat

 (So we strugglin')
 Fighting to eat
 (And we wonderin')
 When we'll be free
 So we patiently wait
 For that faithful day
 It's not far away
 But for now we say

 When I get older
 I will be stronger
 They'll call me freedom
 Just like a wavin' flag
 (And then it goes back x3)

 Ahhho ahhho ahhho

 So many wars, settling scores
 Bringin' us promises, leaving us poor
 I heard them say love is the way
 Love is the answer that's what they say

 But look how they treat us
 Make us believers
 We fight their battes
 Then they deceive us
 Try to control us
 They couldn't hold us
 Cause we just move forward
 Like buffalo soldiers
 (But we strugglin)
 Fighting to eat
 (And we wonderingg)
 When we'll be free
 So we patiently wait
 For that fateful day
 It's not far away
 But for now we say

 When I get older
 I will be stronger
 They'll call me freedom
 Just like a wavin' flag
 (And then it goes back (3x)

 And then it goes
 When I get older
 I will be stronger
 They'll call me freedom
 Just like a wavin' flag
 (And then it goes back (3x)
 Ahhhooo ahhhoooo ahhhooo

 And then it goes

 And everybody will be singing it
 And you and I will be singing it
 And we all will be singing it
 Woah woah woah

 When I get older
 I will be stronger
 They'll call me freedom
 Just like a wavin' flag
 (And then it goes back (3x)

 And then it goes
 When I get older
 I will be stronger
 They'll call me freedom
 Just like a wavin' flag
 (And then it goes back (3x)
 A oh a oh a oh

 When I get older
 When I get older
 I will be stronger

 Just like a wavin' flag (3x)
 Flag(x2)
 Just like a wavin' flag
