                        Listen to the children sing
 Watch them dancing all 'round the christmas tree
 Waiting for the opening
 Early christmas morning All around the world is sleeping
 Little children there's no peeping
 Wait and see what santa's bringing
 Early christmas morning Icicles and breakfast cakes
 Friends and family we will celebrate
 Sounds that joy and laughter make
 Early christmas morning All around and far off places
 Angels waken smiling faces
 Wrapping us with love and graces
 Early christmas morning
 Early christmas morning
