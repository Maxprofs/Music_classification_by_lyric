                        Bài hát: Somebody Sometime - Matthew Barber

You gotta love to lighten that load
You gotta live to die
You gotta lie to somebody sometime
Better make it white

Cause someone will be waiting for you
Somewhere dark and deep
Someone will be greeting you sometime
Somewhere in your sleep
Oh somewhere in your sleep

I think I might need an adventure
I need a visit to some place new
I'm happy enough with the temperature
But I'm unhappy with the view

And maybe I'll finally see it
And maybe I'll finally know
And maybe I'll never return to this place
And maybe I'll never go
Oh and maybe I'll never go

It's Christmas eve and my girl's out at sea
She's a thousand miles away
I'm tossing and turning but will I be earning
A loving come New Years Day

And pretty soon it'll be my birthday
And I'll be 29
So come on Barbie, let's go party
With that bottle of company wine

You gotta love to lighten that load
You gotta live to die
You gotta lie to somebody sometime
Better make it white

Cause someone will be waiting for you
Somewhere dark and deep
Someone will be greeting you sometime
Somewhere in your sleep
Somewhere in your sleep
Somewhere in your sleep
