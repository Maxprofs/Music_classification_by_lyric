 [Chorus:]
 There's nothing in this world
 There's not another girl that could satisfy my needs
 There's nothing in this world
 There's not another boy that could make me feel so sweet
 Coz me love life's so right
 When she hold me so tight, how she kiss me goodnight (night)
 Coz he fills up my life
 Like the sun, he shines bright
 Boy, come with me now

 The first night me meet her
 Yes me senorita me never want to leave her no
 Because the gal look sweet and took her a treat
 And me really want to take her home
 Coz she look nice and she's a one of a kind
 When me look up in her eyes then she got me mesmerised
 Picture perfect like a Kodak moment
 When she kiss me goodnight and she feelin' up on me
 We been there from the jump, never front, never stunt
 Never done what a average girl done
 And I can tell by her body language
 She feels my emotions
 And got me anxious
 So that's me type
 Me and me angel
 And me really have to let her know
 She's the woman of my life
 Oh yes she so right
 So please let the chorus go (oh yeah)

 [Chorus:]
 There's nothing in this world
 There's not another girl that could satisfy my needs
 There's nothing in this world
 There's not another boy that could make me feel so sweet

 Coz me love life's so right
 When she hold me so tight, how she kiss me goodnight
 Coz he fills up my life
 Like the sun, he shines bright
 Boy, come with me now

 I Saw you from across the room
 Looking so fly I gotta talk to you, yeah
 It didn't take a sec to see
 That you're the only one who wanna rescue me (ay)
 I can't lie, boy you're my type of guy
 And there's nothing in this world that can stop me from lovin' you (stop, stop me from lovin' you)

 Girl you put me in a good mood (mood)
 And me love the way you flex too (too)
 We could chill girl, after school (school)
 Coz I ain't trippin girl it's up to you
 And since then we've been inseperable
 Coz I did everything to get next to you
 Since day one you know I stay true
 So ever since then it's been me and my boo

 [Chorus:]
 There's nothing in this world
 There's not another girl that could satisfy my needs
 There's nothing in this world
 There's not another boy that could make me feel so sweet
 Coz me love life's so right
 When she hold me so tight, how she kiss me goodnight
 Coz he fills up my life
 Like the sun, he shines bright
 Boy, come with me now
