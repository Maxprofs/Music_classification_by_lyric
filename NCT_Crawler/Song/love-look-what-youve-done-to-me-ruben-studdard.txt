                        Hoping never end this song
 This could take us all night long
 I looked at the moonlight and I felt good
 Then I looked again and I saw you
 Eyes like fire in the night
 Breath, just burning with their light
 Now I have to spend all night through
 And honey, yes I like to spend it all on you
 You, you

 Love, look what you've done to me
 Never thought I could fall again so easily
 Love, you wouldn't lie to me
 Believe in me to feel this way

 They might fade and turn to stone
 But let's go crazy on alone
 Hold me closer than you ever did
 Close your eyes and I'll be there
 I'll be there
 After all you're still the one
 After all you're still the one
 Girl, take me up onto the stairs until you're done
 Girl, take me where we don't care anymore

 Love, look what you've done to me
 Never thought I could fall again so easily
 Love, you wouldn't lie to me
 Believe in me to feel this way, this way, this way
 Do you feel me baby?
 Look what you've done to me

 Love, look what you've done to me
 Never thought I could fall again so easily
 Love, you wouldn't lie to me
 Believe in me to feel this way
 Oh, baby, look what you've done to me
                        
                    |
