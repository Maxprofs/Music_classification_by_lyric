                        Bài hát: Another Day Of Sun (From "La La Land" Soundtrack) - La La Land Cast

[Intro: First Girl]
Ba-ba-da-ba da-ba-da-ba
Ba-ba-ba ba-da-ba-da-ba
Ba-ba-ba ba

[Verse 1: First Girl]
I think about that day
I left him at a Greyhound station
West of Santa Fé

We were seventeen, but he was sweet and it was true
Still I did what I had to do
'Cause I just knew

Summer: Sunday nights
We'd sink into our seats
Right as they dimmed out all the lights
A Technicolor world made out of music and machine
It called me to be on that screen
And live inside each scene

[Pre-Chorus 1: First Girl & First Man]
Without a nickel to my name
Hopped a bus, here I came
Could be brave or just insane

[First Girl, First Man & Second Man]
We'll have to see

[First Girl]
'Cause maybe in that sleepy town
He'll sit one day, the lights are down
He'll see my face and think of how he...

[First Girl, First Man, Second Man & Dancers]
...used to know me

[Chorus: All]
Climb these hills
I'm reaching for the heights
And chasing all the lights that shine
And when they let you down
You'll get up off the ground
'Cause morning rolls around
And it's another day of sun

[Verse 2: Young Man]
I hear 'em ev'ry day
The rhythms in the canyons
That'll never fade away
The ballads in the barrooms
Left by those who came before
They say "you gotta want it more"
So I bang on ev'ry door

[Pre-Chorus 2: Second Girl]
And even when the answer's "no"
Or when my money's running low
The dusty mic and neon glow
Are all I need

[Young Man]
And someday as I sing my song
A small-town kid'll come along

[Second Girl & Young Man]
That'll be the thing to push him on and go go

[Chorus: All]
Climb these hills
I'm reaching for the heights
And chasing all the lights that shine
And when they let you down
You'll get up off the ground
'Cause morning rolls around
And it's another day of sun

[Instrumental Break]

[Bridge: First Girl]
And when they let you down
The morning rolls around

[All]
It's another day of sun
It's another day of sun
It's another day of sun
It's another day of sun
Just another day of sun
It's another day of sun
Another day has just begun
It's another day of sun

[Outro]
It's another day of sun
                        
                    |
