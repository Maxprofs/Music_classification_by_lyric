                        Bài hát: Can't Get Over You (Ảo Mộng Tình Yêu) - V.A

You said, you’ll never fall in love again.
All you love that left you in pain.
You kept telling me that you’ll not in love
Never fall in love again.

Know you always telling me the true
But you treating me just like a fool.
I know I can’t get it away from you.
Darling! Why can’t our love be real ...

You know just how I can’t get over you.
Don’t you know! How much I love you.
You know I just cannot live my life alone
How can I live my life without your love.

You know just how I can’t get over you.
I’ll do anything to have you
Give me a chance to proof to you my love!
I’ll do anything that you want me to..
