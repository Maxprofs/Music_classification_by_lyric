                        Bài hát: One Step Closer - Shane Harper

Woahhh ohh, hey hey
Listen
I can't keep chasing you around
all of this running just bringing me down
its got me down
Every time I look at you the angels sing
I hope you hear them too
ohhhhhhhh, oh
I hope you here them too
got me feeling hypnotized
and girl it makes me feel alive
Heeyyyy Yeahhh

I'd climb the highest mountain
and I'd sail across the sea
baby for you I'd do anything
I'd fly to the moon
I'd paint your gray skies a beautiful blue
just to get one step closer to you

Don't hesitate there's no better time than now baby
the sky is falling down
well baby are you down, down, down, down

I could wait forever and a day
just to have you look my way (just look my way)
look my way yeah

It's in every little thing I do
'cause baby I do it all for you
Heeyyy yeahhh

I'd climb the highest mountain
and I'd sail across the sea

baby for you I'd do anything
I'd fly to the moon
I'd paint your gray skies a beautiful blue
just to get one step closer to you

I will write you a million love songs
just to hear you sing
baby for you I'd do anything

I'd fight superman
just to hold your hand
I have to get one step closer to you

And now your in my arms
I knew it from the start
That I'd never break your heart
If this ain't love then nothing else is
I'd do anything for just one kiss

I'd climb the highest mountain
I'd sail across the sea
for you I'd do anything
I'd plan a picnic on the moon
just for me and you (x2)

I will write you a million love songs
just to hear you sing
baby for you I'd do everything

Yeah, I'd fight superman
just to hold your hand
have to get one step closer to you

ooohhh, yeahhhh
just to get one step closer to you
