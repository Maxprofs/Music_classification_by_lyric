                        Bài hát: Stay One More Night - Chris Norman

All the words of love and passion.
Never really mean the thing.
When freedom is callin'.
'Cos the times are changing.
Sometimes all the good goes wrong.
And tears fallin'.
I won't ever tell your lies.
You will find'the truth behind my eyes.

CHORUS: Stay one more night.
Let me hold you so tight.
Baby stay another night with me.
And put your arms around me tenderly.

Don't wanna hurt you baby.
Don't know what tomorrow brings.
Nothing forever.
Don't you trust a broken feeling.
Lay your body next to mine.
Oh baby I miss you.
I won't ever tell you lies.
You will find'the truth behind my eyes.

CHORUS: Stay one more night.
Let me hold you so tight.
Baby stay another night with me.
And put your arms around me tenderly

Pleas put your arms around me tenderly

CHORUS: Stay one more night.
Let me hold you so tight.
Baby stay another night with me.
And put your arms around me tenderly

Wanna stay with you baby.
I'll hol you forever and ever.
                        
                    |
