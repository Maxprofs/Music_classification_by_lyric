                        Bài hát: Heroin - Lana Del Rey

[Verse 1]
Topanga is hot tonight, the city by the bay
Has movie stars and liquor stores and soft decay
The rumbling from distant shores sends me to sleep
But the facts of life can sometimes make it hard to dream

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Life rocked me like Mötley
Grabbed me by the ribbons in my hair
Life rocked me ultra-softly
Like the heavy metal that you wear

[Chorus 1]
I'm flying to the moon again, dreaming about heroin
Probably gave you everything and took your life away
I put you on an aeroplane, destined for a foreign land
My hope's that you come back again
And tell me everything's okay, ay, babe, yeah

[Verse 2]
Topanga's hot today, Manson's in the air
And all my friends have come, 'cause they still feel him here
I want to leave, I'll probably stay another year
It's hard to leave when absolutely nothing's clear

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Life rocked me like Mötley
Bad beginning to my new year
Life rocked me ultra-softly
Like the heavy metal that you hear

[Chorus 2]
I'm flying to the moon again, dreaming about heroin
And how it gave you everything and took your life away
I put you on the aeroplane, destined for a foreign land
I thought that you'd come back again
To tell me everything's okay, ay, babe, yeah

[Bridge]
It's *** hot, hot, winter in the city
Something 'bout this weather made these kids go crazy
It's hot, even for February
Something 'bout this sun has made these kids get scary
Oh, writing in blood on my walls and ***
Like oh my God
Dripping off from the walls into the ducts and ***
Oh, ho ho ho, I'd be lying if I said I wasn't sick of it
Lead me, baby, come on, come one, come on, come on

[Chorus 3]
I'm flying to the moon again, dreaming about marzipan
Taking all my medicine to take my thoughts away
I'm getting on that aeroplane, leaving my old man again
I hope that I come back one day
To tell you that I really changed, baby

[Outro]
It's hot, hot, something 'bout the city
Don't know what it is and make's my head get crazy
Oh, makes me feel like I can change
Oh, ho ho ho, all of my evil ways and ***
Oh, I'd be lying if I said I wasn't sick of it
                        
                    |
