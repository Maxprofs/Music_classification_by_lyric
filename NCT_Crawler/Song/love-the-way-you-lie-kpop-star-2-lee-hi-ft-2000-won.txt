                        Bài hát : Love The Way You Lie (Kpop Star 2) - Lee Hi, 2000 Won

On the first page of out story
The future seemed so bright
Then this thing turned out so evil
Don't know why i'm still surprised

Even angels have their wicked schemes
And you take that to new extremes
But you'll always be my hero
Even though you've lost your mind

Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
That's alright because i like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
That's alright because i love the way you lie
I love the way you lie

Na manheun geoseur wonhaji anha
Geujo neor nae gyeote duneungeos nae hyeonsiri nae beop
Sarang geos ppuniya joedae teul lin ge aniya
Siheomi aniya jeongdabeun eopso This is love
Ha i ga mal hae ji sarang jip chagui Best Friend
Neomalhae naege jogeum man cham go relax hae
Geu reo ge swip ge doe myeon gwaen hi sarang i ges seo
Naega matchwo bakkuryeo neoreu apeuge maejil haesseo
Twing gyeo jyeo naga naran byeoge niga bu di hyeo seo
Du ryeo wo honjain moseub jakku geo ure bi chyeo seo
Geurae seo neo deo ugolga mae go ga du ryeo hae
Do mang ga ryeo hajimal hae ha neun ge hwol ssin pyeon hae

Just gonna stand there and watch me burn (Watch me burn)
That's alright because i like the way it hurts (Love the way it hurts)
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry (Hear me cry)
That's alright because i love the way you lie (Love the way you cry)
I love the way you lie

So maybe i'm a masochist
I try to run 
I don't wanna ever never love
Til the wall aere going up
In smoke with all our memories 

Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
That's alright because i like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
That's alright because i love the way you lie
I love the way you lie~
