                        ohhh...

Don't pretend your sorry
I know you're not
You know you got the power to make me weak inside
Girl you leave me breathless
But it's ok
Cause you are my survival
Now hear me say...

I can't imagine life without your love
And even forever don't seem long enough

Chorus:
'Cause every time I breathe I take you in
And my heart beats again
Baby I can't help it
You keep me drowning in your love
And every time I try to rise above
I'm swept away by love
Baby I can't help it (Baby I can't help it)
Keep me drowning in your love

Maybe I'm a drifter
Maybe not
'Cause I have known the safety of flowing freely in your arms
I don't need another lover
It's not for me
'Cause only you can save me
Oh, can't you see

I can't imagine life without your love
And even forever don't seem like long enough
(Don't seem like long enough, yeah)

Chorus(repeat)

Go on and pull me under
Cover me with dreams, yeah
Love me mouth to mouth now
You know I can't resist
'Cause you're the air I breathe

Every time I breathe I take you in (Every time I breathe, yeah)
And my heart beats again
Baby I can't help it (baby I can't help it)
Keep me drowning in your love
And every time I try to rise above
I'm swept away by love
Baby I can't help it (Baby I can't help it)
Keep me drowning in your love (looooooooooooooove)

Baby I can't help it
Keep me drowning in your love (Keep me drowning in your love)

Whoa, got me drowning, keep me drowning in your love
Baby I can't help it (I can't help it, can't help it, no no)

Every time I breathe I take you in (yes I do)
And my heart beats again
Baby I can't help it (Baby I can't help it)
Keep me drowning in love
Every time I try to rise above (Every time I try to rise, rise above)

I'm swept away by love

Baby I can't help it
You keep me drowning in .....your love
