                        Bài hát: Someday at Christmas - The Jackson 5

Someday at Christmas men won't be boys
Playin with bombs like kids play with toys
One Warm December our hearts will see
A world where men are free

Someday at Christmas there'll be no wars
When we have learned what Christmas is for
When we have found what life really worth
There'll be peace on earth

Someday all our dreams will come to be
Someday in a world where men are free
Maybe not in time for you and me
But someday at Christmas time

Someday at Christmas we'll see a land
With no hungry children, no empty hand
One happy morning people will share
A world where people care

OOOH!!!....

Someday at Christmas there'll be no tears
Where all men are equal and no man have fears
One shining moment, one prayer away
From our world today

Someday all our dreams will come to be
Someday in a world where men are free
Maybe not in time for you and me
But Someday at Christmas time

Someday at Christmas men would not have failed
Hate will be gone and love will prevail
Someday in a world that we can all start
With hope in every heart
OOOOh!!!!

Someday at Christmas

But Someday at Christmas time
Someday at Christmas Time!
