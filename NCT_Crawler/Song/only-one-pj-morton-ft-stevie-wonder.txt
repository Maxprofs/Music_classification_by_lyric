                        Bài hát: Only One - PJ Morton, Stevie Wonder

I’m pretty sure I don’t need anything else
This is the best feeling I’ve ever felt
I know it took a long time, but now I’m here
And I ain’t going nowhere, no more fear
Room full of people but I only see you
Yeah, I’m so focused, everything else is in my rear view
Tell me what it’s going to take for you to see
I only wanna be with you,

Chorus:
Say girl, you know that you’re the only one that I want
The one that I want, one that I want
You know that you’re the only one that I need
The one that I need, one that I need
You know that you’re the only one that I want
The one that I want, one that I want
You know that you’re the only one that I need
The one that I need, one that I need
You know that you’re the only one that I want
Ooh

I know you’ve heard me say the same things before
But this time’s different, I’m sure that I want more
So give me just one more chance, I won’t let you down
Just watch what i show you, watch what I show you now
I know that forever is a long time
But there is no other choice in my mind
Tell me what it’s going to take to make you see
That I only wanna be with you

Chorus:
Say girl, you know that you’re the only one that I want
The one that I want, one that I want
You know that you’re the only one that I need
The one that I need, one that I need
You know that you’re the only one that I want
The one that I want, one that I want
You know that you’re the only one that I need
The one that I need, one that I need
You know that you’re the only one that I want
Ooh

Oh I, I’ve made uṗ my mind
I know just what I want
I’m just waiting for you to see
What I see so clearly
I’ve never been more sure
Oh never in my life
But the time is right for you to be my one and only

Chorus:
You know that you’re the only one that I want
The one that I want, one that I want
You know that you’re the only one that I need
The one that I need, one that I need
You know that you’re the only one that I want
The one that I want, one that I want
You know that you’re the only one that I need
The one that I need, one that I need
