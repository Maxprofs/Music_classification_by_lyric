                        Sk8er Boi - Avril Lavigne

He was a boy
She was a girl
Can i make it any more obvious
He was a punk
She did ballet
What more can I say
He wanted her
She'd never tell secretly she wanted him as well
But all of her friends
Stuck up their nose
They had a problem with his baggy clothes

He was a sk8er boi
She said see you later boy
He wasn't good enough for her
She had a pretty face
But her head was up in space
She needed to come back down to earth

5 years from now
She still sits at home
Feeding the baby she's all alone
She turns on tv
Guess who she sees
Sk8er boi rockin on MTV
She calls up her friends
They already know
And they've all get
Tickets to see his show
She tags along
Stands in the crowd
Looks up at the man that she turned down

He was a sk8er boi
She said see you later boy
He wasn't good enough for her
Now he's a super star
Slamming on his guitar
Does your pretty face see what he's worth?

He was a sk8er boi
She said see you later boy
He wasn't good enough for her
Now he's a super star
Slamming on his guitar
Does your pretty face see what he's worth?

Sorry girl but you missed out
Well tough luck that boy's mine now
We are more than just good friends
This is how the story ends
Too bad that you couldn't see,
See the man that boy could be
There is more that meets the eye
I see the soul that is inside

He's just a boy
And Im just a girl
Can I make it any more obvious
We are in love
Haven't you heard
How we rock each others world

I'm with the sk8er boi
I said see you later boy
I'll be back stage after the show
I'll be at the studio
Singing the song we wrote
About a girl he used to know

I'm with the sk8er boi
I said see you later boy
I'll be back stage after the show
I'll be at the studio
Singing the song we wrote
About a girl he used to know
