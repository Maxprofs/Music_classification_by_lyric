                        Bài hát: Kiss The Girl - Dove Cameron, Sofia Carson, Cameron Boyce, Booboo Stewart, China Anne McClain, Thomas Doherty

There you see her
Sitting there across the way
She don't got a lot to say
But there's something about her.

And you don't know why
But you're dying to try
You wanna kiss the girl.

Yes, you want her
Look at her, you know you do
It's possible she wants you too
There's one way to ask her.

It don't take a word, not a single word
Go on and kiss the girl.

Sha la la la la
My oh my
Looks at the boy too shy
Ain't gonna kiss the girl.

Sha la la la la
Ain't it sad
Ain't it a shame, too bad
You're gonna miss the girl.

Now's your moment
Floating in a blue lagoon
Boy, you better do it soon
No time will be better.

She won't say a word
And she won't say a word
Until you kiss the girl.

Sha la la la la
My oh my
Look at the boy too shy
Ain't gonna kiss the girl.

Sha la la la la
Ain't it sad
Ain't it a shame, too bad
You're gonna miss the girl.

Sha la la la la
Don't be scared
You got the mood prepared
Go on and kiss the girl.

Sha la la la la
Don't stop now
Don't try to hide it how
You wanna kiss the girl.

Sha la la la la
Float along, listen to the song
The song says kiss the girl.

Sha la la la la
Music play, do what the music say
You want to kiss the girl.

You've got to kiss the girl
Why don't you kiss the girl
You've got to kiss the girl
Kiss the girl, kiss the girl.

You've got to kiss the girl
You've got to kiss the girl
Whoa, kiss the girl, kiss the girl.

You've got to kiss the girl
You've got to kiss the girl
Whoa, kiss the girl, kiss the girl.
