                        Baby wan't you tell my why. There's sadness in your eyes.
I don't wanna say good bye to you. Love is one big illusion.
I should try to forget. But there is something left in my head.
You're the one who set it up. Now you're the one to make its stop.
I'm the one who's feeling last right now. Now you wan't me to forget.
Every little thing you said. But there is something left in my head.
I won't forget the way, you're kissing. The feeling is so strong, we're lasting for so long.
But i'm not the man your heart, it's missing that's why you go away i know. You were never satisfied, no matter how i tried. now you wanna say goodbye to me. Love is one big illusion. I should try to forget. But there is something left in my head.
...Sitting here all alone in the middle of now here. Don't know which way to go. There ain't so much to say now, Between us , there ain't so much for you, there ain't so much for me any more.
...That's why you go away. i know..............
