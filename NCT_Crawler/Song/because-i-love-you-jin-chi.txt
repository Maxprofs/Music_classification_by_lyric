                        If I got down on my knees and I pleaded with you 
If I crossed a million oceans just to be with you 
Would you ever let me down? 

If I climbed the highest mountain just to hold you tight 
If I said that I would love you every single night 
Would you ever let me down? 

Well I'm sorry if it sounds kinda sad, it's just that 
Worried, so worried 
that you let me down 

Chorus: Because I love you, love you 
Love you, so don't let me down 

If I swam the longest river just to call your name 
If I said the way I feel for you would never change 
Would you ever fool around 

Well I'm sorry if it sounds kinda bad, just that 
Worried, cuz' I'm so worried 
that you let me down
                        
                    |
