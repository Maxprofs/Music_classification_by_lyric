                        [Verse 1]
 Sell the kids for food
 Weather changes moods
 Spring is here again
 Reproductive glands

 [Chorus]
 He's the one
 Who likes all the pretty songs
 And he likes to sing along
 And he likes to shoot his gun
 But he knows not what it means, knows not what it means
 And I say
 He's the one
 Who likes all the pretty songs
 And he likes to sing along
 And he likes to shoot his gun
 But he don't know what it means, don't know what it means
 And I say ahhhhh... 

 [Verse 2]
 We can have some more
 Nature is a ***
 Bruises on the fruit
 Tender age in bloom

 [Chorus]
 Heeeeey... 
 He's the one
 Who likes all the pretty songs
 And he likes to sing along
 And he likes to shoot his gun
 But he knows not what it means, knows not what it means
 And I say
 He's the one
 Who likes all the pretty songs
 And he likes to sing along
 And he likes to shoot his gun
 But he don't know what it means, don't know what it means
 And I say ahhhh... 

 [Chorus]
 Heeeeey... 
 He's the one
 Who likes all the pretty songs
 And he likes to sing along
 And he likes to shoot his gun
 But he knows not what it means, knows not what it means
 And I say
 He's the one
 Who likes all the pretty songs
 And he likes to sing along
 And he likes to shoot his gun
 But he knows not what it means, knows not what it means
 Knows not what it means, knows not what it means
 And I say ahhhh...
