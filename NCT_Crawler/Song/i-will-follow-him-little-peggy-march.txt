                        I will follow Him, follow Him
 Wherever He may go,
 And near Him,
 I always will be,
 For nothing can keep me away,
 He is my destiny.
 I will follow Him, ever since
 He touched my heart I knew,
 There isn't an ocean too deep,
 A mountain so high, it can keep,
 Keep me away, away from His love.

 I love Him, I love Him, I love Him,
 And where He goes, I'll follow, I'll follow, I'll follow.

 I will follow Him, follow
 Him wherever He may go,
 There isn't an ocean too deep,
 A mountain so high, it can keep,
 Keep me away...

 I will follow Him (follow Him),
 Follow Him wherever He may go,
 There isn't an ocean too deep,
 A mountain so high, it can keep,
 Keep me away, away from His love...

 I love Him (Oh yes, I love Him)
 I'll follow (I'm gonna follow)
 True love (He'll alway
 S be my true, true love)
 Forever (Now until forever)
 I love Him, I love Him, I love Him,
 And where He goes, I'll follow, I'll follow, I'll follow,
 He'll always be my true love, my true love, my true love,
 From now until forever, forever, forever...

 There isn't an ocean too deep,
 A mountain so high, it can keep,
 Keep me away, away from His love.
