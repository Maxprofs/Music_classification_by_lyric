                        Bài hát: Emotions - Jennifer Lopez 

Someone took my emotions,
Don't forgive me, I didn't ask
Someone took my emotions,
I feel good, 'cause I don't feel bad

You said that you gon' take my heart babe
But I don't believe in fairytale
It's the same old thing, not a damn thing changed
You're playing games, playing games
Now I'm taking names, taking names now
And I don't play no more, baby, this is game over

Broke your heart for you could feel
Deep we're gonna think we're real,
We're through, me and you
(This is)
Tears fall down, feels like it's raining
'Cause I don't want to feel the pain, me and you
We're through

Someone took my emotions,
Don't forgive me, I didn't ask
Someone took my emotions,
I feel good, 'cause I don't feel bad

I've tried to give you all my time babe
But they never meant a thing to you
So don't you call my name
On my info chain
It's such a shame, what a shame
Now I'm breaking chains, breaking chains
And I don't play no more, baby this is game over

Broke your heart for you could feel
Deep we're gonna think we're real,
We're through, me and you
(This is)
Tears fall down, feels like it's raining
'Cause I don't want to feel the pain, me and you
We're through

Someone took my emotions,
Don't forgive me, I didn't ask
Someone took my emotions,
I feel good, 'cause I don't feel bad

All I ever wanted was your time, right now
I don't even have the patience
I'm tired of waiting for you
I just wanna let go
You try to change me mind
But the answer's still no
Who are you
You don't mean nothing
You ain't worth nothing
When I tell you something
You don't learn from it
I got my bags at the door
Passport to go
When I leave, you gon' come running
You did it yeah
I got no feelings yet
I'm so numb, you're so dumb
It's over, it's over

Someone took my emotions
Someone took my emotions
Everything, everything I do
Everything, everything I do
