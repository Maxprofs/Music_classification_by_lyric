                        Bài hát: Beautiful Now - Zedd, Jon Bellion

[Verse 1]
I see what you're wearing, there's nothing beneath it
Forgive me for staring, forgive me for breathing
We might not know why, we might not know how
But baby, tonight, we're beautiful now

[Pre-Chorus]
We're beautiful now
We're beautiful now

[Chorus]
We might not know why, we might not know how
But baby, tonight, we're beautiful now
We'll light up the sky, we'll open the clouds
Cause baby, tonight, we're beautiful now, we're beautiful (x2)

[Verse 2]
Wherever it's going, I'm gonna chase it
What's left of this moment, I'm not gonna waste it
Stranded together, our worlds have collided
This won't be forever, so why try to fight it?

[Pre-Chorus] + [Chorus]

[Bridge]
Let's live tonight like fireflies
And one by one light up the sky
We disappear and pass the crown
You're beautiful, you're beautiful

[Pre-Chorus x2] + [Chorus]
                        
                    |
