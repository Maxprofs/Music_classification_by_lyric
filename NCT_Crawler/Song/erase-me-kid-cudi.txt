Erase Me Lyrics
Artist(Band): Kid Cudi
(feat. Kanye West)



[Verse 1 (Kid Cudi)]
She said I don't spend time
like I really should
She said she don't know me,
anymore
I think she hates me deep down
I know she does
She wants to erase me
hmmmmmmmmm
A couple days no talking,
I seen my baby
And this what she tells me
She said

[Hook]
I keep on running, keep on running
and nothing works
I can't get away from you,
no
I keep on ducking, keep on ducking
and nothing helps
I can't stop missing you
yeah

[Verse 2 (Kid Cudi)]
It's like I'm her new nightmare
She ain't escaping
It makes me feel a bit complete
yeah
Knowing someone you love
Don't feel the same way about ya
Memories, they soon delete
hmmmmmmm
A couple weeks no talking,
I seen my baby
I've missed you so damn much,
heyy
I wish we could start over,
I told my baby
This what this bitch tells me,
She said

[Hook]
I keep on running, keep on running
and nothing works
I can't get away from you,
no
I keep on ducking, keep on ducking
and nothing helps
I can't stop missing you
yeah

Cuz I'm in the magazines
On the TV
No matter where you are
You might hear me
Cuz I'm in the magazines
On the TV
No matter where you go
You might see me

[Verse 3 (Kanye West)]
Hello, uh, I'm Yeezy
She said, "Hi I'm Aria"
No, you an angel
You wave hi to Aaliyah
I got a show in Korea,
They built a new arena
Why don't you come and
Watch a nigga tear the whole scene up
I know I seen ya before,
but don't know where I seen ya
Oh I remember now
It's something that I dreamed up
Don C says she cool,
But don't let her * her cream up
Monica Lewinski on the dress
She'll take ya to the cleaner
Sure enough a week later
I'm an extra love
And everybody know she mine
So she extra plugged
Every bouncer, every club
Show her extra love
We just praying the new fame
Don't get the best of us
But all good things gotta
Come to an end
She let it go to her head,
No, not a mind reader
The height of her shopping
was the writer's blocking me
I couldn't get me * out
Anyway
I hope you die Aria

[Hook]
She said
I keep on running, keep on running
and nothing works
I can't get away from you,
no
I keep on ducking, keep on ducking
and nothing helps
I can't stop missing you
                        
                    |
