                        Bài hát: It's So Hard To Say Goodbye To Yesterday - Jason Mraz

How do I say goodbye to what we had? The good time that made us laugh Outweigh the bad
I thought we'd get to see forever But forever's gone away It's so hard to say goodbye to yesterday
I don't know where this road is going to lead All I know is where we've been And what we've been through
If we get to see tomorrow I hope it's worth all the wait It's so hard to say goodbye to yesterday
And I'll take with me the memories To be my sunshine after the rain It's so hard to say goodbye to yesterday
And I'll take with me the memory To be my sunshine after the rain It's so hard to say goodbye to yesterday
