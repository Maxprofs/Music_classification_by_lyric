(Do you know what it's like, c'mon, c'mon)
Baby Tell me
To My Heart
Like the kinda girl
That you wanna take me home
Wanna meet me alone
Do you even know what I like
Just what I'm living for,
What I adore
Baby, take the time to realize I'm
not the kind to sacrifice
The way I am
So if you wanna be my man (baby)
Walk a mile in my shoes
Do me right or I'm through
Can't you see that
If you wanna stay around
(you're telling me)
You got to picka me up
Take your time or you loose
This is my game, my rules
Something I can see, obviously,
Baby You don't know
What It's like to be me
Don't you get it twisted boy
I want you to
But you got my heart to win
Before I let you in
And it deceives you baby
I'm not the other in leading
I need tomorrow to love
Baby, take the time to realize I'm
not the kind to sacrifice
The way I am
So if you wanna be my man (baby)
Walk a mile in my shoes
Do me right or I'm through
Can't you see that
If you wanna stay around
You got to picka me up
Take your time or you loose
This is my game, my rules
And I can see, obviously,
Baby You don't know
What It's like to be me
Baby, Get to know me
Then you can show me
that you love for me is true
I'll give you everything
That a girl can give
Don't you wanna be my man?
Walk a mile in my shoes
Do me right or I'm through
Can't you see that
If you wanna stay around
(you're telling me)
You got to picka me up
Take your time or you loose
This is my game, my rules
And I can see, obviously,
Baby You don't know
What It's like
Walk a mile in my shoes
Do me right or I'm through
Can't you see that
If you wanna stay around
You got to picka me up
Take your time or you loose
This is my game, my rules
And I can see, obviously,
Baby You don't know
What It's like to be me
