                        Bài hát: Dance Again (Radio Version) 
- SlimV, Josh Dank, Paul Fiction, Mac Millan

I see myself so very clear tonight 
Don't loose myself in you again
I'm breaking free for real and shine like i used to do
Ido'nt need this sh*t to come over me again
Feel it now and see what it trkes, what it trkes
I'm freed and back full of pride again
I hold my head up high and smile
Tonight i freed myself and dance again
I'm gonna dance, i'm gonna dance again
Again...
I'm gonna dance again
Again...

I won't regret and don't look back
Don't want your excuse anymore, no oh oh
I'm rising up, i'am breaking free
I'm not trking part in your company
Feel it now and see what it trkes, what it trkes
I'm freed and back full of pride again
I hold my head up high and smile
Tonight i freed myself and dance again
I will not...i will, i will, will, i will, will, i will
Dance... again
