[00:-2.00]Daughtry - Every Time You Turn Around
[00:-1.00]

I been me,
I been followin' my dreams
Tryin' to find the scene where you believed me.

I been true,
I been waiting here for you.
I been patient, understanding and believing.

Whoa whoa
Every time you turn around
Whoa whoa
I know you're standing there waiting for me
To take it on back down the other road, baby
But I won't let ya down.

I know you're standing there waiting for me
To take it on back down the other road, baby
But I won't let ya down
Every time you turn around yeahh

I been good,
I been doin' what I should
Workin' hard to make a world that we can live in

I been strong,
I been holding out so long
And I don't you to forget that you're forgiven.
I know you're standing there waiting for me
To take it on back down the other road, baby
But I won't let ya down.

I know you're standing there waiting for me
To take it on back down the other road, baby
But I won't let ya down
Every time you turn around.yeahh

All the reasons you believe what you believe
Never seeing that the truth is a part of me
And all I wanna do is to show you what it really means to love
What it really means to love.

I know you're standing there waiting for me
To take it on back down the other road, baby
But I won't let ya down.
I know you're standing there waiting for me
To take it on back down the other road, baby
But I won't let ya down
Every time you turn around Ohhhh

Every time you turn around Ohhhh

Every time you turn around Ohhhh

Every time you turn around
