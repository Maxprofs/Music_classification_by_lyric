R&B/Hip Hop/Rap|

                        I can't control the way I'm moving hips
Bet you never ever seen it like this
I'm a monster on the floor I can't quit
Now I know it's automatic, it's automatic
It's automatic I’m a runaway train
And it's likely that I tear up this place
When I go, I go hard
I'mma show you this side tonight
It's automatic my condition's unknown
There's no remedy, and no antidotes
It's just the way that I am
Nicki, Nicki, so bad tonight, ah ah ah ah
I can't control the way I'm moving hips
Bet you never ever seen it like this
I'm a monster on the floor I can't quit
Now I know it's automatic, it's automatic
Eh eh eh eh eh eh
It's automatic
Eh eh eh eh eh eh
It's automatic
It's automatic some might call it insane
I assure you I’ll be stuck in your brain
You be falling for me boy
Yeah just like a domino tonight
It's automatic when I’m rockin the beats

Systematically I’m dropping pure heat
It's just the way that I am
Nicki, Nicki, so bad tonight, ah ah ah ah
I can't control the way I'm moving hips
Bet you never ever seen it like this
I'm a monster on the floor I can't quit
Now I know it's automatic, it's automatic
Eh eh eh eh eh eh
It's automatic
Eh eh eh eh eh eh
It's automatic
Press rewind, press rewind
Einstein, I'm looking for that Einstein
Wales, London, Ireland, Scotland, I get idoled in
South Africa, and Brazil
Shut the club down, bring the bill
Bring the bill, bring the bill
Shut the club down, and bring the bill
I can't control the way I'm moving hips
Bet you never ever seen it like this
I'm a monster on the floor I can't quit
Now I know it's automatic, it's automatic
Eh eh eh eh eh eh
It's automatic
Eh eh eh eh eh eh
It's automatic
