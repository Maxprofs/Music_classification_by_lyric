                        I can't light
 No more of your darkness
 All my pictures
 Seem to fade to black and white I'm growing tired
 And time stands still before me
 Frozen here
 On the ladder of my life It's much too late
 To save myself from falling
 I took a chance
 And changed your way of life But you misread
 My meaning when I met you
 Closed the door
 And left me blind by the light Don't let the sun go down on me
 Although I search myself it's always someone else I see
 I'd just allow a fragment of your life to wander free
 But losing everything is like the sun going down on me {Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Elton John!} I can't find
 Oh, the right romantic line
 But see me once
 And see the way I feel Don't discard me, baby don't
 Just because you think I mean you harm
 Just because you think I mean you harm, oh
 But these cuts I have, cuts I have
 They need love, they need love, they need love to help them heal Oh, don't let the sun go down on me
 Although I search myself it's always someone else I see
 I'd just allow a fragment of your life to wander free, oh
 Cause' losing everything is like the sun going down on me Don't let the sun go down on me
 Although I search myself it's always someone else that I see, yeah
 I'd just allow a fragment of your life to wander free baby, oh
 Cause' losing everything is like the sun going down on me {Mr. Elton John}
