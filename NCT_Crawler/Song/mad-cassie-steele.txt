                        Bài hát: Mad - Cassie Steele

Oooh, Oooh, Oooh, Oooh

Do you feel higher as a liar?
Feel the need and the greed
Do you dabble in the fire
When the Devil is asleep?
Do you like a brother's woman?
Let your hands say what they want
Do you like to be the villain?
If you do
Then come on

If you think you're some demented
Miscreant with no where headed
Then I got somewhere you should be
If you think that you're unworthy 
'Cause inside your brain's disturbing
Baby, come along with me

Angry
Baby
Turned into a crazy
Child 
Who got wild in her teens
Angry 
Lady 
Still misbehaving
You're brain sick
Just like me

You know I'm mad
Mad
Mad
You know I'm mad
I'm mad
I'm mad
I'm mad
You know

Are you down in the daylight?
Are you happy when it rains?
Does the night make you alive?
Feel the dark in your veins
Do you like a little substance?
Do you love a lot of drink?
Do the hot and heavy moments
Make your life worth living?

If you think you're some demented
Miscreant with no where headed
Then I got somewhere you should be
If you think that you're unworthy 
'Cause inside your brain's disturbing
Baby, come along with me

Angry
Baby
Turned into a crazy
Child 
Who got wild in her teens
Angry 
Lady 
Still misbehaving
You're brain sick
Just like me

You know I'm mad
Mad
Mad
You know I'm mad
I'm mad
I'm mad
I'm mad
You know

Ever get the feeling
That we'll be alright?
Life was meant for living
We're doing just fine
Don't let nobody tell you 
That your soul ain't right
Because you need the darkness
To enjoy the light

Angry
Baby
Turned into a crazy
Child 
Who got wild in her teens
Angry 
Lady 
Still misbehaving
You're brain sick
Just like me

You know I'm mad
Mad
Mad
You know I'm mad
I'm mad
I'm mad
I'm mad
You know

Angry
Baby
Turned into a crazy
Child 
Who got wild in her teens
Angry 
Lady 
Still misbehaving
You're brain sick
Just like me

You know I'm mad
Mad
Mad
You know I'm mad
I'm mad
I'm mad
I'm mad
You know

Baby, come along
I know what you want
Baby, come along
Baby, come along
You know what I want
Baby, come along
You know what I want
