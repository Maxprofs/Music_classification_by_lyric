                        [ti:I've seen it all]
[ar:Maya Saban/Schiller]
[al:Leben]
Moments of eternity
Strangers stealing someone elses dream
I've seen it all
Hunting for a mistery
Running for your live in times like these
I've seen it all
I remember the time
Once in a life, oh baby
Got you here in my head,
Here in my head, oh maybe
I've seen it all...
Waiting on a bed of nails
Time is running slow until it ends
I've seen it all
Hunting for a mistery
Running for your life in times like these
I remember the time
Once in a life, oh baby
Got you here in my head,
Here in my head, oh maybe
I've seen it all...
Like i ÃÅve never seen before
Catching up a smile instead of frown
Asking you to never let me down
It will never be the same forever
I've seen it all...
