                        I'm livin' in the 21st century
 Doin' something mean to it
 Do it better than anybody you ever seen do it
 Screams from the haters, got a nice ring to it
 I guess every superhero need his theme music
 No one man should have all that power
 The clock's tickin', I just count the hours
 Stop trippin', I'm trippin' off the power
 (21st century schizoid man)
 The system broken, the schools closed, the prisons open
 We ain't got nothin' to lose, ma'f-cka, we rollin'
 Huh? Ma'f-cka, we rollin'
 With some light-skinned girls and some Kelly Rowlands
 In this white man's world, we the ones chosen
 So goodnight, cruel world, I see you in the mornin'
 Huh? I see you in the mornin'
 This is way too much, I need a moment
 No one man should have all that power
 The clock's tickin', I just count the hours
 Stop trippin', I'm trippin' off the power
 'Til then, f-ck that, the World's ours
 And then they (Go)
 And then they
 And then they (Go)
 And then they (21st century schizoid man)
 F-ck snl and the whole cast
 Tell 'em Yeezy said they can kiss my whole ass
 More specifically, they can kiss my ***
 I'm an ***? You n-ggas got jokes
 You short-minded n-ggas' thoughts is Napoleon
 My furs is Mongolian, my ice brought the goalies in
 Now I embody every characteristic of the egotistic
 He know, he so, f-ckin' gifted
 I just needed time alone, with my own thoughts
 Got treasures in my mind but couldn't open up my own vault
 My childlike creativity, purity and honesty
 Is honestly being prodded by these grown thoughts
 Reality is catchin' up with me
 Takin' my inner child, I'm fighting for it, custody
 With these responsibilities that they entrusted me
 As I look down at my dia-mond-encrusted piece
 N-gga, no one man should have all that power
 The clock's tickin', I just count the hours
 Stop trippin', I'm trippin' off the power
 'Til then, f-ck that, the World's ours
 And then they (Go)
 And then they
 And then they (Go)
 And then they
 And then they (Go)
 And then they (21st century schizoid man)
 Colin Powells, Austin Powers
 Lost in translation with a whole f-ckin' nation
 They say I was the obamanation (abomination) of Obama's nation
 Well, that's a pretty bad way to start the conversation
 At the end of day, goddammit, I'm killin' this sh-t
 I know damn well y'all feelin' this sh-t
 I don't need yo' p-ssy, bitch, I'm on my own d-ck
 I ain't gotta power trip, who you goin' home with?
 How 'Ye doin'? I'm survivin'
 I was drinkin' earlier, now I'm drivin'
 Where the bad bitches, huh? Where ya hidin'?
 I got the power, make yo' life so excitin' (So excitin')
 Now this would be a beautiful death
 Jumpin' out the window
 Lettin' everything go
 Lettin' everything go
 N-now-now this would be a beautiful death
 Jumpin' out the window
 Lettin' everything go
 Lettin' everything go
 Now this would be a beautiful death
 Jumpin' out the window
 Lettin' everything go
 Lettin' everything go
 You got the power to let power go
