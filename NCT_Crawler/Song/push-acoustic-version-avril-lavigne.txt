                        Been seein' to much of you lately
 And you're starting to get on my nerves.
 This is exactly what happened last time and it's not what we deserve
 It's a, it's a waste of my time lately.
 And I'm running out of words.
 If it's really meant to be than you can find a way to see

 [Chorus:]
 Maybe you should just shut up
 Even when it gets tough
 Baby 'cause this is love.
 And you know when push comes to shove
 It's gonna take the both of us
 Baby, this is love
 Baby, this is love

 Love
 Love
 Love
 It's really great to be with you
 This is how I spend my life
 But I'm capable of taking care of myself
 So if you *** this up than go take a hike
 It's a waste of my time
 Shakin' it up,
 Goin' out to search if it's really meant to be
 Then you could find a way to see

 [Chorus:]
 Maybe you should just shut up
 Even when it gets tough
 Baby 'cause this is love.
 And you know when push comes to shove
 It's gonna take the both of us
 Baby, this is love
 Baby, this is love

 [Bridge - sung by Evan Taubenfeld]
 You and me
 We can both start over
 Just the two of us
 We can get a little closer

 [Bridge continues â€” Avril & Evan - Duet]
 So follow me
 Honestly
 And you will see - Yeah

 [Chorus:]
 Maybe you should just shut up
 Even when it gets tough
 Baby 'cause this is love.
 And you know when push comes to shove
 It's gonna take the both of us
 Baby, this is love
 Baby, this is love

 Maybe you should just shut up
 Even when it gets tough
 Baby 'cause this is love.
 And you know when push comes to shove
 It's gonna take the both of us
 Baby, this is love
 Baby, this is love
 Love
 Love
 Love
