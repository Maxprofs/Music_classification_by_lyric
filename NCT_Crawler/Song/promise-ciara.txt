Promise
Ciara
Come enjoy the light
Baby take a ride
I just wanna lie with you
Baby you and I
Can Have A Good Time
tell me what you like
oeh - oeh
I've been single for a while now
I've been kinda lonely
I've been looking for somebody to talk to - love me
Someone who can hold me, is that you

I am looking for somebody I can talk to
Looking for the only to give my all to
Tell me if that is you you you
What you wanna do you you you

You can be my teacher I do homework
You can give me extra credit baby
I'll do more than work
What you wanna do do do
Now it's me and you you you

This Mood Is So Right
It Feels So Right
You can be a prince my knight
You can be my superman save me here I am

Cause baby there is nothing I won't do
To spend my life with you
I'll give my all to you
I promise that I will never lie

There is nothing I won't do
To spend my life with you
I'll give my all to you
I promise that I will never lie

You and me together picture perfect
I'll spend all my money all the time because you are worth it
It's just me and you you you
What you wanna do do do
Come mama's boy like a baby thinking about you dreamin about you got me going crazy

What you wanna do do do
Now it's me and you you you
I am lonely

This Mood Is So Right
It Feels So Right
You can be a prince my knight
You can be my superman save me here again
Cause baby there is nothing I won't do
To spend my life with you
I'll give my all to you
I promise that I will never lie

There is nothing I won't do
To spend my life with you
I'll give my all to you
I promise that I will never lie

I not be everything I say
From my bottom of my heart

I would never never ever hurt you
I open my heart
Give it to you
Tell the whole world that I am in love with you
Whatever you want baby
I know I work my body yes but you

Cause there is nothing I won't do - baby
To spend my life with you
I'll give my all to you
I promise that I will never lie

Cause there is nothing I won't do
To spend my life with you
I'll give my all to you
I promise that I will never lie
