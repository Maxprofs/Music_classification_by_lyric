                        Here comes the snow-white Christmas
 Out of your screen
 Thank God for Disney
 It all looks like a dream
 To make it special
 Special for you Look up for red and white Santa
 On your soda machine
 If not for Coca-Cola
 He would (He would) still have been green
 To make it special
 Special for you But tonight I know (Ooh...)
 Everything's gonna be alright (Alright, alright)
 Yeah, tonight's the night (Ooh...)
 Everything's gonna be alright And now I bet you that the DJ's gonna spin you a Christmas
 To get you in the feeling
 And there will be plastic snow all over the world
 Falling from the ceiling, oh-oh-oh (Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)
 Whether you love or hate it, oh-oh-oh
 (Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)
 You're gonna celebrate it This is the season where that Wham! song
 Damages your head (Damages your head)
 And all the dreams of white Christmas
 Are getting you wet
 To make it special
 Special for you (Ooh...) Be ready to get stuffed like a turkey
 With candy and twinkle lights
 Stargazing snowmen
 And bells playing 'Silent Night' (Ooh...) Everything's gonna be alright And now I bet you that the DJ's gonna spin you a Christmas (Yeah)
 To get you in the feeling
 And there will be plastic snow all over the world (Yeah)
 Falling from the ceiling, oh-oh-oh (Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)
 Whether you love or hate it, oh-oh-oh
 (Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh) (Yeah)
 You're gonna celebrate it, oh-oh-oh (Bring it all down loud) DJ, DJ, DJ, DJ, DJ, DJ, DJ, DJ, DJ, DJ, DJ, DJ...
 (Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)
 DJ, DJ, DJ, DJ...
 (Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)
 DJ, DJ, DJ, DJ...
 Oh-oh-oh
 (Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)
 DJ, DJ, DJ, DJ...
 (Ooh-ooh) And now I bet you that the DJ's gonna spin you a Christmas (Yeah)
 To get you in the feeling
 And there will be plastic snow all over the world (Yeah)
 Falling from the ceiling, oh-oh-oh (Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh) (Yeah)
 Whether you love or hate it, oh-oh-oh
 (Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh) (Yeah)
 (Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh) You're gonna celebrate it, oh-oh-oh
