                        Bài hát : Going Wrong (Remix) - DJ Khang Chivas, Armin van Buuren, Chris Jones

Yea I keep dreaming
But I have it all
Ooh I'm still craving
To have you by my side

I know our love is fading
But soon it will shine

And I can't see today
And I can't see tomorrow
You're burning out of my head
And my brain its going wrong

And I will live today
And I will love tomorrow
No matter what is said or done
Even if its going wrong

Even if its going wrong [2x]
You're burning out my head

I keep searching
Forever in your eyes
I'll be careful
But soon we will shine

And I can't see today
And I can't see tomorrow
You're burning out of my head
And my brain its going wrong

And I will live today
And I will love tomorrow
No matter what is said or done
Even if its going wrong

Even if its going wrong [2x]
You're burning out my head

Even if its going wrong

You're burning out my head
And I can't see today
And I can't see tomorrow [3X]

You're burning out my head
And I will live today
And I will love tomorrow
No matter what is said or done
Even if its going wrong
                        
                    |
