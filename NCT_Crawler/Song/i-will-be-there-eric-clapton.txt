                        Bài hát: I Will Be There - Eric Clapton

When times are hard
And friends are few
And you need someone
To help you through
Just call my name
And I'll come running to your side
Don't be afraid, don't be afraid

I will be there
(When you are lost, lost in the night
Nowhere to turn)
I will be there
(Don't be afraid, don't be afraid)

When morning comes
And nothing's changed
And the world outside
Plays the same old game
Just call on me
And I will ease your lonely heart
Don't be afraid, don't be afraid

I will be there
(When you are lost, lost in the night
Nowhere to turn)
I will be there
(Don't be afraid, don't be afraid)
I will be there
(When everyone that you believed
Still lets you down)
I will be there
(Don't be afraid, don't be afraid)

I will be there, don't be afraid
I will be there, don't be afraid
When morning comes
And nothing's changed
And the world outside
Plays the same old game
When everyone still lets you down
I will be there
When times are hard
And friends are few
And you need someone to help you through
I will be there, don't be afraid
I will be there, don't be afraid
I will be there
                        
                    |
