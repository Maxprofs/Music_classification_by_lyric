                        Ooh, Yeah
 Oh yeah
 Oh Life
 Oh Life
 I'm afraid of the dark
 Especially when I'm in the park
 When there's no one else around
 Oh I get the shivers
 I don't wanna see a ghost
 It's the sight that I fear most
 I'd rather have a piece of toast
 Watch the evening news
 Life, oh life
 Oh life, oh life
 Life, oh life
 Oh life, oh life
 I'm a superstitious girl
 I'm the worst in the world
 Never walk under ladders
 I keep a rabbits' tail
 I'll take you up on a dare
 Anytime, anywhere
 Name the place, I'll be there
 Bungee jumping, I don't care
 Life, oh life
 Oh life, oh life
 Life, oh life
 Oh life, oh life
 Life
 So after all's said and done
 I know I'm not the only one
 Life indeed can be fun
 If you really want to
 Sometimes living out your dreams
 Ain't as easy as it seems
 You wanna fly around the world
 In a beautiful balloon
 Life, oh life
 Oh life, oh life
 Life, oh life
 Oh life, oh life
 Life, oh life
 Oh life, oh life
 Life, oh life
 Oh life, oh life
 Oh life, oh life..
