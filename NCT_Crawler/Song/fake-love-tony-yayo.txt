                        My life, my life, my life, my life
 Yeah, yeah, yeah
 My life, my life, my life, my life Fake love's when your homie give you dap
 Smile in your face but he wants your ass clapped
 (Fake love)
 Fake love's when they never be around
 But once you get rich, they all get down
 (Fake love) Fake love's when your friend *** your bitch
 Don't think with his head only think with his dick
 (Fake love)
 So my friends enemies and my enemies be friends
 Don't show no love, don't pretend 50 got Yayo gettin' all this cash
 Now all these yes men wanna ***
 But back in the street you ain't help me re-up
 Locked up, I had court dates, you never showed up What the ***, tell me what you grinnin' at nigga?
 If I get killed, my stash, you spendin' that nigga
 Some people want nothin' outta life
 And some people want it all, let's ball I see the jealousy and envy when you see me shoppin'
 Sapphire watch, got your jaw droppin'
 When I move that 8th, you were 7 gram coppin'
 You ain't happy for me, you hope that the Feds watchin' I ain't stoppin', homie I'm number one
 Why you schemin' on me, I'm plain and dumb
 So when it comes to the point, that you ready to flip
 I'ma pull out first, and let off my clip, take that Fake love's when your homie give you dap
 Smile in your face but he wants your ass clapped

 And your man ain't your man if he shortenin' you nigga
 Listen money talks, and bull*** run marathons
 When your money's gone, that's when them hoes gon' Fake love is when a nigga sets you up
