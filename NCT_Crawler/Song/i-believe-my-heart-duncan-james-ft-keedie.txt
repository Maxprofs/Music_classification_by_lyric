                        Whenever i see your face, the world disappears, 
All in a single glance of, revealing, 
You smile and i feel as though, ive known you for years, 
How do i know to trust what im feeling. 

- Chorus-
I believe my heart, what else can i do, 
When every part of every thought leads me straight to you, 
I believe my heart, theres no other choice, 
For now whenever my heart speaks, i can only hear your voice. 

A lifetime before we met, has faded away, 
How did i live a moment without you, 
You dont have to speak at all, i know what you'd say, 
And i know every secret about you. 

- Chorus - 
I believe my heart, it believes in you, 
Its telling me that what i see is completely true, 
I believe my heart, how can it be wrong, 
It says that what i feel for you i will feel my whole life long. 

I believe my heart, it believes in you, 
Its telling me that what i see is completely true, 
And with all my soul i believe my heart, 
The portrait that it paints of you, is a perfect work of art
                        
                    |
