Jonas Brothers - That's Just The Way We Roll

I woke up on my roof with my brothers
There's a whale in the pool with my mother
And my dad paints the house different colors
Where would we be if we couldn't dream?

And I know we get a little crazy
And I know we get a little loud
And I know we're never gonna fake it
We are wild, we are free
We are more than you think
So call us freaks
But that's just the way we roll

You've got moves, I've got shoes
Let's go dancing
Pop-and-lock
Battle dance against Hanson
If we lose
All the girls, they'll be laughing
Where would we be if we couldn't dream?

And I know we get a little crazy
And I know we get a little loud
And I know we're never gonna fake it
We are wild, we are free
We are more than you think
So call us freaks
But that's just the way we roll

Cause we're old enough to know
We're never letting go
Cause that's just the way we roll

And I know we get a little crazy
And I know we get a little loud
And I know we're never gonna fake it
We are wild, we are free
We are more than you think
So call us freaks
But that's just the way we roll

That's just the way we roll
Oh, that's just the way we roll
