                        First, first time I looked into your eyes
 I saw Heaven, oh, Heaven in your eyes
 Everything I did before you, wasn't worth my while
 It should've been you, you all the time I'd do anything and everything to please you
 You know how much I need you
 You're always, always, on my mind You're more than wonderful, more than amazing
 The irreplaceable love in my life
 You're so incredible, here in these arms tonight
 The irreplaceable, love of my life Always, seems like a reality
 Forever, don't seem so far away
 All I wanna do, all I wanna feel, all I wanna be is close to you
 Everyday, is my lucky day All I wanna do, is love you
 I place no one above you
 I'll tell you why You're more than wonderful, more than amazing
 The irreplaceable, love, love, of my life
 You're so incredible, here in these arms of mine
 The irreplaceable, love of my life Baby, you know, you know you're my one and only
 All I wanna do is be together
 Sugar, you know, I'll never leave you lonely
 In your eyes, in your eyes, I see forever You're more than wonderful, more than amazing
 The irreplaceable, love of my life
 You're so incredible, here in these arms tonight
 The irreplaceable, love, love, of my life
