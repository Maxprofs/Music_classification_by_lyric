                        Bài hát: Betrayed - Lil Xan

[Intro]
Huh? Ayy
You are now listening to a Bobby Johnson beat
What? Yeah, ayy, ayy

[Verse 1]
Pop the trunk, I open up, I sold my soul for a good price
Outta sight, and my hoe got talent, right?
Whole squad ran through that ***, yikes
Ayy, I’m a business man, I did my business, damn
But I'ma bend it down and I'ma lick her up, then dick her down
She gon' turn around then I'm gon' kick her out
She gon' talk that *** but say
How you make it up? How you fake a love?
Holy son, I was the chosen one
I'm sippin' out the grail, she gon' kiss and tell
She keep my wishes well (but) I don't need her, well
How my enemy a friend of me?
Why y'all feed off my energy? Like I ain't dead yet
Higher entity, foreign bitch that think she into me
Whip the foreign very viciously
Why these dudes wanna take pics with me?
She said she gay but still into me, said she gay but still into me
Said that she hates that I'm in the streets
And said that I hate that I'm in the streets
I wanna blow up or make history
And she said that she hate my Insta feed

[Chorus]
Xans don't make you
Xans gon' take you
Xans gon' fake you
And Xans gon' betray you
Xans don't make you
Xans gon' take you
Xans gon' fake you
Xans gon' betray you

[Verse 2]
And her pussy tastes like skittles, what?
Yeah, ayy, and you can really taste the rainbow, what? (hah, no)
Yo' bitch just like a crayola (what, ayy)
You can draw her on the table, flip her like some yola
Heart shaped kisses, I really miss my mistress
666, evil bitches want my mentions
Heart shaped kisses, I really miss my mistress
And it's 666, evil bitches want my mentions

[Chorus]
Xans don't make you
Xans gon' take you
Xans gon' fake you
And Xans gon' betray you
Xans don't make you
Xans gon' take you
Xans gon' fake you
Xans gon' betray you

[Outro]
Xans gon' fake you
Xans gon' betray you
Xans gon' take you
Xans gon' betray you
Xans gon' take you
Xans gon' take you
What, ayy, what, ayy
Xans gon'—, xans gon' take you
Yeah, Xans gon'
Xans' gon take you
Xans' gon take you
                        
                    |
