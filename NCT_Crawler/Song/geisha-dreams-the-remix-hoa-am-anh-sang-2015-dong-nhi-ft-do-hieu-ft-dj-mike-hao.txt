                        Bài hát: Geisha Dreams (The Remix)
Ca sĩ: Đông Nhi, Đỗ Hiếu, DJ Mike Hào

Empty heart and empty soul
A lover on remote control
All colors fade to grey
The more they play this love charade

Why don't you see, 
why don't you feel that love is free?

Itchy-kee, itchy-kou
All alone in Tokyo
Don't you see, don't you know,
They have nowhere else to go
Itchy-kee, itchy-kou
Far away from Tokyo,
They believe in geisha dreams

Perfect body and perfect smile
An illusion for awhile
Born to love and trained to please
And paid to put your mind at ease

But don't you see, but don't you feel that love is free?

Itchy-kee, itchy-kou
All alone in Tokyo
Don't you see, don't you know,
They have nowhere else to go
Itchy-kee, itchy-kou
Far away from Tokyo,
They believe in geisha dreams
                        
                    |
