                        Bài hát: Me Against The World - 2Pac

[Hook: 2Pac]
It's just me against the world
Nothing to lose
It's just me against the world, baby
I got nothing to lose, it's just me against the world
Stuck in the game
Me against the world, baby
[Verse 1: 2Pac]
Can you picture my prophecy?
Stress in the city, the cops on top of me
The projects is full of bullets, though bodies is droppin'
They ain't no stoppin' me
Constantly moving while making millions
Witnessing killings
Leaving dead bodies in abandoned buildings
Can't reach the children cause they're illin'
Addicted to killin' and the appeal from the cap peelin'
Without feelin', but will they last or be blasted?
Hard headed ***
Maybe he'll listen in his casket; the aftermath
More bodies being buried, I'm losing my homies in a hurry
They're relocating to the cemetery
Got me worried, stressin', my vision's blurried
The question is will I live? No one in the world loves me
I'm headed for danger, don't trust strangers
Put one in the chamber whenever I'm feeling this anger
Don't wanna make excuses, cause this is how it is
What's the use? Unless we're shooting no one notices the youth. It's just me against the world, baby

[Hook: 2Pac & Puff Johnson]
Me against the world
It's just me against the world
It's just me against the world
Me against the world
Cause it's just me against the world, baby
Me against the world
I got nothing to lose, it's just me against the world, baby
I got nothing to lose

[Verse 2: Yaki Kadafi]
Could somebody help me? I'm out here all by myself
See ladies in stores, Baby Capone's, living wealthy
Pictures of my birth on this Earth is what I'm dreamin'
Seeing Daddy's semen, full of crooked demons
Already crazy and screamin'
I guess them nightmares as a child
Had me scared, but left me prepared for a while
Is there another route? For a crooked Outlaw
Veteran, a villain, a young thug, who one day shall fall

[Verse 3: E.D.I. Mean]
Everyday there's more death, and plus I'm dough-less
I'm seeing more reasons for me to proceed with thievin'
Scheme on the schemin' and leave they peeps grievin'
Cause ain't no bucks to stack up, my nuts is backed up
I'm about to act up, go load the MAC up, now watch me klacka
Tried making fat cuts, but yo, it ain't workin'
And evil's lurkin', I can see him smirkin' when I gets to pervin'
So what? Go put some work in, and make my mail
Making sales, risking 25 with a L, but oh well

[Hook: 2Pac & Puff Johnson]
Me against the world
With nothing to lose, it's just me against the world
It's just me against the world, baby
Me against the world
I got nothing to lose, it's just me against the world
It's just me against the world, baby
With nothing to lose, it's just me against the world, baby
Me against the world
Me against the world
I got nothing to lose, it's just me against the world, baby

[Verse 4: 2Pac]
With all this extra stressin'
The question I wonder is after death, after my last breath
When will I finally get to rest through this suppression?
They punish the people that's asking questions. And those that possess steal from the ones without possessions
The message I stress: to make it stop, study your lessons
Don't settle for less, even the genius asks his questions
Be grateful for blessings, don't ever change, keep your essence
The power is in the people and politics we address
Always do your best, don't let the pressure make you panic
And when you get stranded
And things don't go the way you planned it
Dreaming of riches, in a position of making a difference
Politicians and hypocrites, they don't wanna listen
If I'm insane, it's the fame made a brother change
It wasn't nothing like the game, it's just me against the world

[Hook: 2Pac & Puff Johnson]
Me against the world
Nothing to lose, it's just me against the world, baby
Me against the world
Got me stuck in the game, it's just me against the world
Nothing to lose, it's just me against the world, baby
Me against the world

[Outro: 2Pac]
Hahaha, that's right
I know it seem hard sometimes
But uh, remember one thing
Through every dark night, there's a bright day after that
So no matter how hard it get
Stick your chest out, keep your head up, and handle it!
