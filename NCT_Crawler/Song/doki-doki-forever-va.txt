                        Bài hát: Doki Doki Forever - V.A

[Intro]
Doki, doki!

[Verse 1: (Sayori)]
Hey hey!
My heart's beating when I'm hanging out with you
Why does my heart ache?
When I hear you feel the same way too

[Natuski]
Just like a sundae
It's sweet every time when I teach you something new
Is this by chance? Or fate?
Whenever it's just me and you?
(Don't get the wrong idea!)

[Yuri]
When we touch, it'll never be enough

[Sayori]
Is it way too much if you had to choose just one of us?

[Chorus (Natsuki)]
Tell me, tell me, please
Is this what I think or is it just me?
Don't wake me up from this sweet little dream
Where we'll be together, forever
We'll never gonna be apart (Doki, doki!)

[Yuri]
Will it be okay?
If I express my love for you this way?
No matter what you do or what you say
Where we'll be together, forever
We'll never gonna be apart

[Monika]
(We're never gonna be apart)

[Verse 2: (Yuri)]
Hey, hey
When I'm next to you, I don't know what to do
Why does it feel so great
When our eyes meet out of the blues?
(I-I'm sorry I said too much!)

[Sayori + Monika]
I really love
The way you write even when you don't have a clue
I wanna hear you say:
"This love that I am feeling is true"

[Natsuki]
Tasty love
Something I want more of

[Yuri]
Will it make the cut
If you had to choose just one of us?

[Chorus: (Monika)]
Shall I leave you be?
Is it love if I can set you free?
But even if it's not reality
Let's be together, forever
We're never gonna be apart (Doki, doki!)

[Yuri]
How can I convey
My love for you before they fly away?
I think about it all day every day
We'll be together, forever
We're never gonna be apart

[Outro: (Monika)]
One by one
They only
Fall apart
Can it be undone?
Why can't I just be the one for once?

*Glitches like crazy*
                        
                    |
