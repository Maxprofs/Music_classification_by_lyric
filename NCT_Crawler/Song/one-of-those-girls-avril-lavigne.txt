Avril Lavigne-One Of Those Girls
Album:The Best Damn Thing

I know your kind of girl
You only care about one thing
Who you\'ve seen or where you\'ve been
Who\'s got money
I see that look in your eyes
It tells a million lies
But deep inside I know why
You\'re talking to him
I know what you\'re all about
I really hope he figures it out
She\'s one of those girls
nothing but trouble
Just one look
and now you\'re seeing double
Before you know it she\'ll be gone
Off to the next one
She\'s so good
that you won\'t see it coming
She\'ll take you for a ride
and you\'ll be left with nothing
You\'ll be broken she\'ll be gone
Off to the next one

She\'s going to be the end of you
At least that\'s what they say
It\'s been a while
you\'re in denial
And now it\'s too late
The way she looks it makes you high
All the warning signs
Cause her blonde hair
her blue eyes
It makes you want to die

I know what she\'s all about
I really hope you figure it out

She\'s one of those girls
nothing but trouble
Just one look
and now you\'re seeing double
Before you know it she\'ll be gone
Off to the next one
She\'s so good
that you won\'t see it coming
She\'ll take you for a ride
and you\'ll be left with nothing
You\'ll be broken she\'ll be gone
Off to the next one
You know it\'s a game
You know it\'s a game
She\'s keeps playing around with your head
Playing around with your head

She\'s so insane So insane
She\'s the one to blame
She\'s the one to blame

She\'s one of those girls
nothing but trouble
Just one look
and now you\'re seeing double
Before you know it she\'ll be gone
Off to the next one
She\'s so good
that you won\'t see it coming
She\'ll take you for a ride
and you\'ll be left with nothing
You\'ll be broken she\'ll be gone
Off to the next one

Off to the next one

Off to the next one
