                        Bài hát: I Just Can't Stop Loving You - Michael Jackson, Siedah Garrett

I Just want to lay next to you for awhile
You look so beautiful tonight
Your eyes are so lovely
Your mouth is so sweet
A lot of people misunderstand me
That's because they don't know me at all
I just want to touch you and hold you
I need you
God I need you
I love you so much
Each time the wind blows
I hear your voice so
I call your name 
Whispers at morning
Our love is dawning
Heaven's glad you came 
You know how I feel
This thing can't go wrong
I'm so proud to say I love you
Your love's got me high
I long to get by
This time is forever
Love is the answer
I hear your voice now
You are my choice now
The love you bring
Heaven's in my heart
At your call I hear harps
And angels sing
You know how I feel
This thing can't go wrong
I can't live my life without you
I just can't hold on
I feel we belong
My life ain't worth living
If I can't be with you
I just can't stop loving you
I just can't stop loving you
And if I stop
Then tell me just what will I do
I just can't stop loving you
At night when the stars shine
H-m-m
I pray in you I'll find
A love so true 
M-m-m m-m-m
When morning awakes me
Will you come and take me
I'll wait for you
You know how I feel
Ah
I won't stop until
I hear your voice saying "I do"
"I do"
This thing can't go wrong
This feeling's so strong
Well my life ain't worth living
If I can't be with you
I just can't stop loving you
W-h-o-a w-h-o-a oh
I just can't stop loving you
And if I stop
Uh huh
Then tell me just what will I do
Wel-l-l
I just can't stop loving you
We can change all the world tomorrow
We can sing songs of yesterday
I can say hey farewell to sorrow
This is my life and I want to see you for always
I just can't stop loving you
No, baby (Oh)
I just can't stop loving you
If I can't stop
And if I stop (Oh)
Then tell me just what will I do (Oh)
What will I do?
Uh ooh 
I just can't stop loving you
Hee-hee-hee
Know I do girl
I just can't stop loving you
You know I do
And If I stop
Then tell me just what will I do
                        
                    |
