                        Today I saw somebody
 Who looked just like you
 She walked like you do
 I thought it was you An' as she turned the corner
 I called out your name
 I felt so ashamed
 'Cause it wasn't you
 Wasn't you You are everything
 And everything is you
 You are everything
 Everything is you
 Oh, you are everything
 And everything is you How can I forget
 When each face that I see
 Brings back memories
 Of being with you Oh baby, I just can't go on
 Living life as I do
 Comparing each one with you
 'Cause they just won't do
 They're not you No baby, you are everything
 And everything is you
 Oh, you are everything
 And everything is you
 Oh, you are everything
 And everything is you Everything
 Everything you are to me baby
 No, no everything
 Please baby, everything
 You, you are everything
 No, oh baby, I just cannot compare
