                        Bài hát: Every Day Is a Holiday - Katy Perry

The fire
The cold nights
The brightest of all lights
You were my home wherever we’d go
We don’t need a thing under the tree
You’re giving me all I need, yeahhh!

Every day is a holiday (holiday)
When you're the reason to celebrate
Every day is a holiday
When you're the reason, oh!
Every day is a holiday
When you're the reason to celebrate (the reason)
Every day is a holiday
When you're the reason, you are the reason
(Reason, reason, reason)

You're giving me
All I need, ehhh!
