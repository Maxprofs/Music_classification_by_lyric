                        Bài hát: 1000 Words (Final Fantasy X-2 - English Version) - Jade

I know that you're hiding things
Using gentle words to shelter me
Your words were like a dream
But dreams could never fool me
Not that easily

I acted so distant then
Didn't say good bye before you left
But I was listening
Don't fight your battles far from me
Far too easily

Save your tears
cause I'll come back
I could hear that you whispered
As you walked through that door
But still I swore
To hide the pain
When I turn back the pages
Shouting might have been the answer
What If I cried my eyes out
And begged you not to part

But now I'm not not afraid
To say whats in my heart

Oh a thousand words
Have never been spoken
Will fly to you
Passing over the time
And distance holding you
Suspended on silver wings

And a thousand words
One thousand confessions
Will cradle you
Taking all of the pain
You feel so far away
They'll hold you forever

The dream isn't over yet
Though I often say I cant forget
I still relive that day
You've been there with me all the way
I still hear you say

Wait for me I'll write you letters
I can see how you stared
With your eyes to the floor
But still I swore
To hide the doubt
When I turn back the pages
Anger might have been the answer
What if I'd hung my head
And said that I couldn't wait

But now I'm strong enough to know
Its not too late

Cause a thousand words
Called out through the ages
They'll fly to you
Even though I can't see
I know their reaching you
Suspended on silver wings

Oh a thousand words
One thousand embraces
Will cradle you
Making all of your weary
They seem far away
They'll hold you forever

Oh a thousand words
(One thousand words)
have never been spoken
(Oh Yeah)
They'll fly to you
And carry you home
(Carry you home!)
And back into my arms
Suspended on silver wings!
(On silver wings!)

And one thousand words
(oh)
Called out through the ages
(Call through the ages)
They'll cradle you
(Oh yeah)
Through all of the lonely
No more lonely days (Lonely days) They'll hold you forever

Ohhh
A thousand words...
                        
                    |
