                        Bài hát: New Americana - Halsey

Cigarettes and tiny liquor bottles,
Just what you'd expect inside her new Balenciaga.
Viral mess turned dreams into an empire.
Self-made success now she rolls with Rockefellers.

Survival of the richest, the city's ours until the fall.
They're Monaco and Hamptons bound, but we don't feel like outsiders at all.

We are the new Americana (ah, ah, ah)
High on legal marijuana (sky high)
Raised on Biggie and Nirvana (ah, ah, ah)
We are the new Americana (ah...)

Young James Dean, some say he looks just like his father,
But he could never love somebody's daughter.
Football team loved more than just the game
So he vowed to be his husband at the altar.

Survival of the richest, the city's ours until the fall.
They're Monaco and Hamptons bound but we don't feel like outsiders at all.

We are the new Americana (ah, ah, ah)
High on legal marijuana (sky high)
Raised on Biggie and Nirvana (ah, ah, ah)
We are the new Americana (ah, ah, ah)

We know very well who we are, so we hold it down when summer starts.
What kind of dough have you been spending?
What kind of bubblegum have you been blowing lately?

We are the new Americana (ah, ah, ah)
High on legal marijuana (sky high)
Raised on Biggie and Nirvana (ah, ah, ah)
We are the new Americana (ah, ah, ah)
We are the new Americana (ah, ah, ah)
High on legal marijuana (sky high)
Raised on Biggie and Nirvana (ah, ah, ah)
We are the new Americana.
Oh oh
