 Luda!
 She ride it like a roller coaster
 Soon as I get her to the top, she screams
 I put her out like a light, she'll be out for the night
 Soon as her head hit the pillows, sweet dreams Wake her up about 30 minutes later
 Calling me the Terminator, let's go again
 Red zone, I'ma get her first down
 Call me Luda true breeze, I throw it in
 ciara
 Touchdown, he scores, Ludacris the MVP
 With a rack like that and a back like that, CiCi better *** me
 'Cause them legs just keep on going, so I gotta put her to bed
 Let the 808 thump, and the beat go bump
 'Cause she ride it like a thoroughbred He love the way I ride it
