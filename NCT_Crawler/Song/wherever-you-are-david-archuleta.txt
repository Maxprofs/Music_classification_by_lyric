                        Bài hát: Wherever You Are - David Archuleta

I love to see the ocean's beauty
And the moon that shines above
Alone in the sand looking at the stars
Wishing someday I would find true love
Would it be nice to see the morning
With the one you love the most
Would it be nice to say goodnight
To the one you hold so close to your heart
To your heart

The wind that blows the dove
Is the wind that blows my love
Hope it'll find its way to you wherever you are

I love to sit in fields of green
Looking deeply through the sky
Watching birds as they fly by
Hoping someday fate will bring me true love
Would it be nice to hold someone
So dear near you're heart
Would it be nice to hear those words
I love you from the one that you love
That you love

The wind that blows the dove
Is the wind that blows my love
Hope it'll find its way to you wherever you are

I'd love to see myself one day
In the arms of someone
Who will share her life with me, selflessly
Someday, you will find your way to me
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah

The wind that blows the dove
Is the wind that blows my love
Hope it'll find its way to you wherever you are
The wind that blows the dove
Is the wind that blows my love
Hope it'll find its way to you wherever you are
Wherever you are
Wherever you are
Wherever you are
