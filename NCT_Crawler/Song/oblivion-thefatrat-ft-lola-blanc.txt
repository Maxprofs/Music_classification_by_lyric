                        Bài hát: Oblivion - TheFatRat, Lola Blanc

I, I, want you to lift me up so high, high
A place that no one tell about
Take me to the very end
Oh, oh, I wanna feel the dark with you, you
A place that no one tell about
Take me to the very end

(Instrumental)

A place that no one tell about
Take me to the very end

(Instrumental)

I, I, want you to lift me up so high, high
A place that no one tell about
Take me to the very end
Oh, oh, I wanna feel the dark with you, you
A place that no one tell about
Take me to the very end.
