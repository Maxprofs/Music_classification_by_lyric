                        Bài hát: When You Tell Me That You Love Me - Diana Ross

I wanna call the stars down from the sky
I wanna live a day that never dies
I wanna change the world only for you
All the impossible I wanna do

I wanna hold you close under the rain
I wanna kiss your smile and feel the pain
I know what's beautiful looking at you
In a world of lies you are the truth

And baby every time you touch me I become a hero
I'll make you safe no matter where you are
And bring you everything you ask for nothing is above me
I'm shining like a candle in the dark when you tell me that you love me

I wanna make you see just what I was
Show you the loneliness and what it does
You walked into my life to stop my tears
Everything's easy now I have you here

And baby every time you touch me I become a hero
I'll make you safe no matter where you are
And bring you everything you ask for nothing is above me
I'm shining like a candle in the dark when you tell me that you love me

In a world without you, I would always hunger
All I need is your love to make me stronger

And baby every time you touch me I become a hero
I'll make you safe no matter where you are
And bring you everything you ask for nothing is above me
I'm shining like a candle in the dark when you tell me that you love me
You love me, when you tell me that you love me
                        
                    |
