                        Bài hát : Part Of Your World - Jodi Benson

Look at this stuff. Isn't it neat?
Wouldn't you think my collection's complete?
Wouldn't you think I'm a girl
A girl who has everything?

Look at this trove, treasures untold
How many wonders can one cavern hold?
Looking around here, you'd think
Sure, she's got everything

I've got gadgets and gizmos a-plenty
I've got who's-its and what's-its galore
You want thing-a-ma-bobs? I've got twenty
But who cares? No big deal. I want more

I wanna be where the people are
I wanna see, wanna see them dancing
Walkin' around on those
What you call them? Oh, feet

Flipping your fins, you don't get too far
Legs are required for jumping, dancing
Strolling along down that
What's that word again? Street

Up where they walk, up where they run
Up where they stay all day in the sun
Wandering free, wish I could be
Part of that world

What would I give if I could live
Out of these waters?
What would I pay to spend a day
Warm on the sand?

Betcha on land they understand
That they don't reprimand their daughters
Bright young women, sick of swimming
Ready to stand

And ready to know what the people know
Ask them my questions and get some answers
What's a fire?--and why does it
What's the word? Burn

When's it my turn?
Wouldn't I love, love to explore
That shore up above?
Out of the sea
Wish I could be
Part of that world
                        
                    |
