                        Bài hát: Chilly Cha Cha - Lynda Trang Đài, Tommy Ngô

Tonight I'm seeing double (lets move your body!)
Something's taken over me (pump pump pump your body!)
I'm about to lose control! 
There's a drum inside my head!
My oh my whats goin on!!

If you look a little closer in the mirror
You might notice there's a stranger staring back
With a wilder side that you just can't hide
You might as well admit the fact
You can feel the rhythm move you like a tremor
And the groove begins to make your body sweat
And although you try you just can't deny
It's a melody you can't forget

I I I want you to move a little closer
I I I need you to take me by the hand hand
Pledge tonite we'll dance until we melt together
We'll unite two souls become a single flame...

CHILLY CHA CHA!!

Tonight I'm seeing double (lets move your body!)
Something's taken over me (pump pump pump your body!)
I'm about to lose control! 
There's a drum inside my head!
My oh my whats goin on!!

Let the music override your ambition
Close your eyes and set your spirit free
It's the spice of life when the beat is right
It will move you so don't hold back

I I I want you to move a little closer
I I I need you to take me by the hand hand
Pledge tonite we'll dance until we melt together
We'll unite two souls become a single flame..
