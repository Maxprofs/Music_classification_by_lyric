                        Whole world is watching us now
It's a little intimidating
But since there's no way to calm down
Let's give them something amazing

Let's make them remember
Using one word
Incredible (oh, oh, oh)
Incredible (oh, oh, oh)

Let's make them remember
We were incredible
Simply incredible

We even counted all stars
We were real sure we'd make it
Well, we learned no matter what they need shout
It's nothing we can't take care

We'll go down in history
That describe all of us
Incredible (oh, oh, oh)
Oh, incredible (oh, oh, oh)

Let's make them remember
We were incredible
Simply incredible

Everybody say "oh"
Say oh
Say no
Say oh

Let's make them remember
That describe all of us
Incredible (oh, oh, oh)
Oh, incredible (oh, oh, oh)

Let's make them remember
We were incredible
Simply incredible

Simply incredible

Oh oh oh oh
