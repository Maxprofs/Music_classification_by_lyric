                        Oh wow yea yea
I love you more than I can say
I’ll love you twice as much tomorrow
Oh love you more than I can say

Woo woo yea yea
I miss you every single day
Why must my life be filled with sorrow?
I love you more than I can say

Don’t you know I need you so?
Oh tell me please I gotta know
Do you mean to make me cry?
Am I just another guy?

Wow wow yea yea

Why must my life be filled with sorrow?
Oh love you more than I can say

Oh, Don't you know I need you so?
Oh tell me please, I gotta know,
