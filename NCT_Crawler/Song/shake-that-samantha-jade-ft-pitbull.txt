                        Bài hát: Shake That - Samantha Jade, Pitbull 

Samantha Jade
Mr. Worldwide
Shake That
We're gonna shake it from Miami to Australia
Shake That
That's right

Tell me what you've been drinking
I can tell what you're thinking
That I'll be yours for the weekend

Honey
I gotta do it my way so
Don't rush, don't rush
Just lay low
But be ready when I say go

If you just want one hit
I guarantee you'll miss
Because my heart and this
They go together

If all you want is fun
Then after that you're done
I'd rather wait for someone
Who loves me better

Oh, ooh
Don't talk to me (Ooh)
Prove to me (Ooh)
You won't only be

One foot in
One foot out
Gotta step up
If you wanna get down
Shake That (Ohhhh)
Shake That (Ohhhh)

One foot in
One foot out
Better man up
If you wanna get down
Shake That (Ohhhh)
Shake That (Ohhhh)

(Woo, ow)
I'm all about my business
Make 'em work, make 'em work
With the quickness
Girls, can I get a witness?

Honey
I ain't sayin' I'm perfect
But I know I'm deservin'
And I'm gonna be worth it, yeah

If you just want one hit
I guarantee you'll miss
Because my heart and this
They go together

If all you want is fun
Then after that you're done
I'd rather wait for someone
Who loves me better

Oh, ooh
Don't talk to me (Ooh)
Prove to me (Ooh)
You won't only be

One foot in
One foot out
Gotta step up
If you wanna get down
Shake That (Ohhhh)
Shake That (Ohhhh)

One foot in
One foot out
Better man up
If you wanna get down
Shake That (Ohhhh)
Shake That (Ohhhh)

(Woo, ow)
(Wanna get)
(Wanna-w-wanna get down-down)
(W-wanna get down)

Shake That
I wanna see you in your birthday suit
Shake That
Mami, show me where your sweet little cake at
I wanna take a little nibble or maybe a full bite, and make it a full night

I roll dice and gamble
Too hot to handle
Me, I'm all ears unlike Vincent Van Gogh
So tell me what you want
Tell me what you need
Tell me what you like
And I'll do it, do it right

Me, I mind my business
No I'm not the mob
But your boy, I got a hit list
My life's my trial
Jehovah's my witness
Rewind it a couple of times
And maybe you'll get this

You need a man in your life
Them boys that you're playin' with ain't doin' you right
Two times, say it twice
Need a man in your life
Them boys that you're playin' with ain't doin' you right
Samantha Jade, talk to 'em

Ohhhh, hey!

One foot in
One foot out
Gotta step up
If you wanna get down
Shake That (Ohhhh)
Shake That (Ohhhh)

One foot in
One foot out
Better man up
If you wanna get down
Shake That (Ohhhh)
Shake That (Ohhhh)

One foot in
One foot out
Gotta step up
If you wanna get down
Shake That (Ohhhh)
Shake That (Ohhhh)

One foot in
One foot out
Better man up
If you wanna get down
Shake That (Ohhhh)
Shake That (Ohhhh)
Shake That
