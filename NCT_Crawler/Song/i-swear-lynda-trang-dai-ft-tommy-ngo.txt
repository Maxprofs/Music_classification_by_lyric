                        Bài hát: I Swear - Lynda Trang Đài, Tommy Ngô

I swear by the moon and the star in the sky
And I swear like the shadow that's by your side

I see the questions in your eyes
I know what's weighing on your mind
You can be sure I know my part
Cause I'll stand beside you through the years

You'll only cry those happy tears
And though I'll make mistakes
I'll never break your heart

And I swear by the moon and the stars in the sky
I'll be there
I swear like the shadow that's by your side
I'll be there

For better or worse till death do us part
I'll love you with every beat of my heart
And I'll swear
Uhh, uuh, uhh

I'll give you everything I can
I'll build your dreams with these two hands
We'll hang some memories on the walls

And when just the two of us are there
You wont have to ask if I still care
Cause as the time turns the page
My love won't age at all

And I swear by the moon and the stars in the sky
I'll be there
I swear
Like the shadow thats by your side
I'll be there

For better or worse, till death do us part
I'll love you with every beat of my heart
I swear

I swear by the moon and the stars in the sky
I'll be there
I swear
Like the shadow thats by your side
I'll be there

For better or worse, till death do us part
I'll love you with every single beat of my heart
I swear, uhh
I, I, I swear
