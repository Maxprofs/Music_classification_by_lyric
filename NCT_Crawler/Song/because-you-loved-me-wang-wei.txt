                        Bài hát: Because You Loved Me - Wang Wei

If I swam the longest river 
Just to call your name
If I said the way.
I feel for you would never change 
Uould you ever fool around.
Well I'm sorry if it's some kind 
to bear just then worried.
I'm so worried that you'd let me down.
Because I love you love you
love you love you so don't let me down.
Because I love you love you.

Well I'm sorry if it's some kind to bear just then worried
I'm so worried that you'd let me down.
Because I love you love you, I love you love you love you.
