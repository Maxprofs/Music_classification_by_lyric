                        Bài hát: Only One - Ciara

I cried out but you didn't hear me
Cried words I didn't know I knew
A lit a light, you still didn't see me
I swore I shine my way to you

[Pre-Chorus:]
Kiss me, hold me
Touch me, tease me
You make love and you not easy
If only you could see
Could see what you do to me
I ain't second to nobody
Baby you should understand
It's either them or me

[Chorus:]
Cause I'm not gonna be your one and only
Just when I'm the only one around
Your one and only
Just when I'm the only one, the only one around

Why do I, do I still want you
After all of the things you do
I know you won't be committed to me
Tell me why I choose to stay
There ain't no one but myself to blame

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus]

Oh, guess I do it to myself boy
Oh, guess I do it to myself
Your one and only
Your one and only
One and only
                        
                    |
