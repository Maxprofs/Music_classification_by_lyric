                        Yeah, yeah
 What's he gonna say? You wanna be like me, son, get a change of plan
 I don't hardly see my dawgs, get a hand, pick ma fam'
 Confused, feeling used, trying to rearrange plans
 As I've got a Rolex but no time on my hands Made a transition from a brain into a man
 Step one, never mix ya business or fam'
 Haters say I changed but I quite disagree
 'Cause the figures damn skippy, ain't the same in the bank And I just wanna say thanks to those trying to pull me down
 I was born to be fly, I don't like the ground
 So don't tell me stay grounded I'm good in my town
 And when I was blue you just ran around I shouldn't know stress at my age
 Money came around me then everybody changed
 Fools say they know me from day dawgs
 Stop trying to call me by my government name 'Cry, it's all Chipmunk now
 You can blow after, it's Chipmunk now
 It's Chipmunks' time, Chipmunk's in his prime
 And only Chipmunk can take Chipmunks' shine I made a transition, I made a transition
 You can say I made a transition I'm feeling like I found myself but lost my mind
 They wanna take my life, I take my time
 I am hair and flesh but lost my life
 My privacy went up in the sky when I signed I With this six figures then I grin teeth
 Airing all the tag alongs like bring me
 I never breaded no one when I was working
 So hate me if you want but don't say I don't deserve it Understand the position I played then
 Understand the transition I made then
 Go and picture me back in the days then
 Look at me now and get mad They just wanna get fly up and down, jet lagged
 Now everybody step back
 I'm on the next thing, it's not a bless thing
 They're number 2, I'm on some next *** First place that's the first base
 Suicide that's the worst case
 That's when you're whole lifetime
 Just trying to get your dough up
 And then you blow up, and blow up No escalators, stairs and I'm still trying to step up
 But I think it's trying to handle the pressure
 I can't let the game slip away
 When the UK routes for my name, Shame It's all Mr. Munk now
 You can blow after, it's Mr. Munk now
 It's Mr. Munk Time, Mr. Munk's in his prime
 And only Mr. Munk can take Mr. Munks' shine I made a transition, I made a transition
 You can say I made a transition Being successful as a gift and a curse
 Being paid or being broke I know what's worse
 And people at the bottom say that you forgot you're roots but
 That's always the case when you rise from the dirt And preparation is the key to elevation
 But them man are too busy hating debating
 If I sound better on some grime ***
 Half of them don't even know what grime is, it's timing Even though I blew quicker than your average
 I came through slicker than your average
 'Cause yeah, I'm not your average spitter Any tempo or instrumental
 The flows mental, straightjacket worthy
 Conspiracy, they put in to merc me
 If I'm not fire how could you burn me? Insulting how could you out me
 I'm so true how could you doubt me?
 Allow me 'Cry, it's all me now
 You can blow after, it's all me now
 It's all me time, it's all me in my prime
 And only I can take my shine Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
 You can say I made a transition
 Ha, ha, ha, eh Here we go
 Ch-change, ch-change
 Change, change, change, change
 Change, change, change
