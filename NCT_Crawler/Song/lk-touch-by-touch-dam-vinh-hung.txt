Touch by touch, you're my all time lover,
Skin to skin, com under my cover.

When I feel the time is right and you're staying by my side
And the love you gave to me, makes my heart beat.
Whan my fancy's flying away, but my feeling that makes me stay,
I see the fire in your eyes, it makes my heart beat.
Do it we still do it night and day, you're my all time lover.
Do it we still di it in the way, like there is no another.
Touch by touch, you're my all time lover,
Skin to skin, com under my cover.

When my heart is full of love, it makes me a total down
Love is a game that wa play night and day.
When our love is clear and bright, it's our way to see the light
There's fire in your heart, night and day.
Do it we still do it night and day, you're my all time lover.
Do it we still di it in the way, like there is no another.
Touch by touch, you're my all time lover,
Skin to skin, com under my cover.

Do it we still do it night and day, you're my all time lover.
Do it we still do it in the way, like there is no another.
Touch by touch, you're my all time lover,
Skin to skin, com under my cover.
Do it we still do it night and day, you're my all time lover.
Do it we still do it in the way, like there is no another.
Touch by touch, you're my all time lover,
Skin to skin, com under my cover.

When I saw you at the party
You were talking to a girlfriend

I just walked across the room and said: hello
Hello
Hello !
While we danced I felt your body

Touched your face and dared to kiss you

When the song was over I just couldn't let you go

You go
You go!

Hey hello - be my darling
Hey hello - be my girl

Always wanted so rnuch more than just a one night love affair
Hey hello - feel the magic
Hey hello - in the air

I can give you so much more than just a one night love affair

Midnight-hour in my apartment

I could feel your burning passion

When I loved you in the shadow of the night
You were leaving in the morning

But you promised you would call me

One more kiss
I'll see you soon
And then goodbye!

Hey hello - be my darling
Hey hello - be my girl
. . 

Hey hello - be my darling
Hey hello - be my girl
. . 
Hey hello - feel the magic
Hey hello - in the air

I can give you so much more than just a one night love affair

Oh, the night is my world
City light painted girl
In the day nothing matters
It's the night time that flatters
In the night, no control
Through the wall something's breaking
Wearing white as you're walkin'
Down the street of my soul

You take my self, you take my self control
You got me livin' only for the night
Before the morning comes, the story's told
You take my self, you take my self control

Another night, another day goes by
I never stop myself to wonder why
You help me to forget to play my role
You take my self, you take my self control

I, I live among the creatures of the night
I haven't got the will to try and fight
Against a new tomorrow, so I guess I'll just believe it
That tomorrow never comes

A safe night, I'm living in the forest of my dream
I know the night is not as it would seem
I must believe in something, so I'll make myself believe it
That this night will never go

Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh

Oh, the night is my world
City light painted girl
In the day nothing matters
It's the night time that flatters

I, I live among the creatures of the night
I haven't got the will to try and fight
Against a new tomorrow, so I guess I'll just believe it
That tomorrow never knows

A safe night, I'm living in the forest of a dream
I know the night is not as it would seem
I must believe in something, so I'll make myself believe it
That this night will never go

Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
You take my self, you take my self control
You take my self, you take my self control
You take my self, you take my self control...
