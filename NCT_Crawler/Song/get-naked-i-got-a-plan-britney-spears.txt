Yeah
it Sounds nice
Ooh, yeah
I got a plan
We can do it just what you wanted Baby, baby ,baby
As long as you wanna come with me
We can do it baby, baby , baby
We can do it just what you wanted Baby, baby , baby
My body is calling Out for you bad boy
I get the feeling that just wanna be with you
Baby I'm a freak And I don't really give a damn
I'm crazy as a Motherfucker
Put that on your man
If you like what you see
And your curiousity
Let your mind roam free
Won't you pay attention please?
What I gotta do To get you want my body
Quarter past three Ready to leave the party?
(What you gonna do, do, do?)
Get naked
Take it off
I'm not ashamed of my beauty You can see what I got
It will freak you out
Imagine if I work it out
If I get on top
You're gonna lose your mind
Better put it down
You know should be around
(I can understand that you ain't got plans)
that you got no pain
then i just want to take you hand
then i need you to understand
We got it If you like what you see
Get naked (Would you mind?)
Get naked (Now take it off, yeah)
Get naked (Baby, take it off)
I just wanna take it off
(Baby, take it off)
I just wanna take it off(What you gonna do, do, do?)
