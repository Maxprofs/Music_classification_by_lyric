                        Now
Tomorrow is all there is
No need to look behind the door
You won't standing there no more
I had my chance
To dance another dance
I didn't even realise
That this was all love and no lies
Then I lost you

I guess I loved you
Less, less than I should
Now all there is
It's me and me
I turn around and all I see
The past where I have left our destiny

Now
Tomorrow is a mystery
I can not live without a dream
Vanishing from reality
I wanna know
Would you come back to me?
Now that I finally realised
You are my home
You are my life
I need you

I guess I loved you
Oh, less, less than I should
Now all there is
It's me and me
I turn around and all I see
The past where I have left our destiny

I guess I loved you
Ah, less, less, less, less than I could
Another time
Another run
To mend both of our broken hearts
To tell you how much I can love you now

I guess, I guess I loved you
I guess I loved you
                        
                    |
