                        Bài hát: I Want You - Air Supply

If it's love that you want, there will always be someone
If it's love that you need, i can lay here at your feet
When your fingers want to hold someone close to you
Oh, don't you know baby

I want youâ€¦.

When it's time to begin, you can tell me, let me in
Every moment, every day, i'll be waiting every way
Till you're here next to me and you want me too
Oh, don't you want, baby i know you

I want youâ€¦

If it's love that you want, there will always be someone
If it's love that you need and you want me too
Don't you want, baby i know you

Breathe in my love, breathe out your love
Before its too late, too late

I want youâ€¦
                        
                    |
