                        Bài hát: Wanted Dead Or Alive - Bon Jovi

It's all the same, only the names will change 
Everyday it seems we're wasting away 
Another place where the faces are so cold 
I'd drive all night just to get back home 

I'm a cowboy, on a steel horse I ride 
I'm wanted dead or alive 
Wanted dead or alive 

Sometimes I sleep, sometimes it's not for days 
And the people I meet always go their separate ways 
Sometimes you tell the day 
By the bottle that you drink 
And times when you're alone all you do is think 

I'm a cowboy, on a steel horse I ride 
I'm wanted (wanted) dead or alive 
Wanted (wanted) dead or alive 

Oh! And I ride!
                        
                    |
