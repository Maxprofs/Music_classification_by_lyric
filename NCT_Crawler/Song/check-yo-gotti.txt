                        YO GOTTI - CHECK LYRICS
 I got a check, check, check, beep.
 Bitch I got a check, check, check
 Bitch I got a check, check, check I buy anything I want, 'cause I got a check,
 *** any bitch I want, 'cause I got a check.
 I only ride foreign 'cause I got a check.
 You know I'm fully armed, you ain't gotta check
 And every time you see me I be on a deck
 Looking like money, smelling like a jet,
 Brand new swag, got me on flex.
 Whole lot of cash, I'm a walking check. Uh, I got my check up, I need a check-up.
 Watch on me so cold, chain on me so froze.
 Check, I got them hoes, check, designer clothes,
 I got them bows, plus I got them o's.
 Going hard, Nigga, I do too,
 I got shooters Nigga, what about you?
 Valet park Nigga there's my coupe
 Popping bottles Nigga, there's my crew.
 That pussy good, ass fat, head right, Nigga, that's my boo.
 A real Nigga, you ain't one, hate on me, that's what you do.
 Ooh, I'm in my zone,ooh, my money long,
 Sipping on that ciroc, inhaling all of the strong.
 On my young Nigga ***, rolling with the belt,
 I'm on my rich Nigga ***, Rolls Royce are better. Hook 1X I put on for my city, go strong when I kick it,
 Got a bad girls club, a gang of bad bitches
 Black diamonds, A.P., oil spill, B.P., white diamonds, mula
 No diamonds, hair blow, ace of spades, no cards.
 Go to pee and glow in the dark.
 I got soft, I go hard, start to beating my favorite part.
 The California my favorite car, the Land Landing, my favorite bar.
 I hit the club, my jay's on, they out now, yeah, they stood on the boss.
 Selling dope my first job, getting money, their worst thought.
 I'm in this bitch with my home boys,
 Big jewelry, no bodyguard.
 I pull up, like who this, thugged out, I do this.
 Checking on my dollar sign, get money on my to do list. Hook 1X Check, check, bitch, I'm on a deck
 Flex, flex, looking like a jet.
 Check, check, bitch, I'm on a deck
 Flex, flex, looking like a jet. I buy anything I want, 'cause I got a check,
 *** any bitch I want, 'cause I got a check.
 I only ride foreign 'cause I got a check.
 You know I'm fully armed, you ain't gotta check
