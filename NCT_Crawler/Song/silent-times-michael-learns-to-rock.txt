                        Bài hát: Silent Times - Michael Learns To Rock

The cars go screaming by
But I can't hear a thing inside my mind
I couldn't even shout to ask you why
Why you stopped believing

No sound to this heart beat
I only feel the trains beneath my feet
The ground is shaking now or is it me
'cause I've lost all feeling

In this quiet place

These are silent times
The words wither away
Just like a flower that dies
There's nothing left to say

You tell yourself you're fine
But inside you despise your quiet lies
There's no way to disguise what's in your eyes
The tears that are streaming

And how can you explain?
When no one understands a word you say
And everything that's left will fade to grey
And lose all its meaning
What to say

These are silent times
The words wither away
Just like a flower that dies
There's nothing left to say

And these are silent times
We hide it all away
There's nothing left but space
There's nothing left to save

Silence is all you've left behind
Its only purpose to remind
Me of the time I can't rewind
There's nothing left to save

Words only break your heart again
Too late to ever make amends
Lost all your faith and confidence
There's nothing left to say
There's nothing left to say 
There's nothing left to say 
There's nothing left to say 

'Cause these are silent times
The words wither away
Just like a flower that dies
There's nothing left to say

And these are quiet times
We hide it all away
There's nothing left but space
There's nothing left to save
                        
                    |
