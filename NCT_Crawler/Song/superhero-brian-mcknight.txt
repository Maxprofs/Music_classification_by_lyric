                        One look in your eyes
 Though I'm stronger than a locomotive
 I can't tell a lie
 Now that you've become my very life
 Enough is enough, no more disguise I'm yours, baby you're mine
 I'm your superhero, for you I will fight
 I'll save your life
 I'm your superhero, all day, all night Kal-el, son of Jor-el
 All my secrets, you can never tell
 And you know why
 Especially about the kryptonite
 And by the way, I can fly I'm yours, baby you're mine
 I'm your superhero, for you I will fight
 I'll save your life
 I'm your superhero, all day, all night I can't see through lead
 But I am faster than a speeding bullet
 You are all I need to make it
 Through this lonely, daily planet I'm yours, baby you're mine
 I'm your superhero, for you I will fight
 I'll save your life
 I'm your superhero, all day, all night I'm yours, baby you're mine
 I'm your superhero, for you I will fight
 I'll save your life
 I'm your superhero
