                        Bài hát: Call Me Mother - RuPaul

[Verse 1]
Guess who's back in the house
Heels click-clackin' about
Fine, fresh, feminine, style to eleven
I'm divine, so heavenly
Gentlemen sweatin'
It's dimes across the board with no doubt
Body like WOW!
Pussy bouta end this drought
Titties so plentiful, fishy queen jezebel
Should be criminal
Don't make sense for a bitch to be this endowed
Rock to the south
What is that sound?
Watch me drop, drop, drop into the ground
Wait for the four, drop to the floor
Add up the tens to get the score
I been that bitch, yes I love that drama
Fishy, feminine up-and-comer
From the Clintons to the Obamas
I keep it tight, now they call me Mother
Shady queen bitch, I love that drama
Fishy, feminine up-and-comer
From the Clintons to the Obamas
I keeps it tight, now they call
Me
Mother

[Breakdown] [x2]
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Brrat-at-at
Na-na-na-na-na-now
Giggity-giggity, how
Brrat, get back
Ba-pa-da-pa-pa-POW
A cunny hunny, a cunny hunny
A honey bun but I
Count my money, I count my money
With a brap-brap, knick to da knick da knick-knack
I'm back with the freaky money
Click-clack, ow

[Bridge]
Jaded queen
Shade machine
Gangsta lean
Best believe (Mother Ru)

[Verse 2]
I'm that Glamazon
They know my name because I'm on another echelon
Miss Automatic, Supersonic, I'm a Sass-a-tron
And I ain't lookin' up to anyone that gams along
And I'm ready shake the jelly when the jam comes on
The kind of thing that all the fellas make advances on
I'm only gettin' out of bed for $20 Million
Now get your camera phone
Cause in a minute I'm about to be on
(Here come that girl)
Here come that girl, o-oh *** what up
(Give me twirl)
Give them twirl, that's the bread and butter
(Clutch them pearls)
Clutch your pearls, she's the big shot caller
(Calls me squirrel)
Get-get run over, over
None of these bitches is cunty like Ru
Clockin' these chickens I cluck and they cooped
Runnin' my business, Miss Boss comin' through
When I step in you know well what it do
Uh, y'all know well what it do
None of these bitches is fuckin' with Ru
Runnin' my businesses, don't need a whip
Yes, when I step in, they know well what it do
When I step in, they know well what it do
Yeah, bitch, she done already done had hers
She been done had herses
