                        Bài hát: Face The Sun - James Blunt

Yes, this love's not good enough 
Is time to let it go 
Our weary hearts just fall apart, 
I feel it in my bones 

And God knows 
That it's hard to find the one 
But in time, 
All the flowers turn to face the sun 

So silently just walk with me, 
Like any other day 
No sad goodbyes, no tears, no lies, 
Just go our separate ways 

And God knows 
That it's hard to find the one 
But in time, all the flowers 
Yes in time, 
All the flowers turn to face the sun 

Oh... 
Yeah say what you say 
Then you do it do it anyway 
Do what you do 
Then you walk away and walk away 
Say what you say 
Then you do it do it anyway 
Do what you do 
Yeah I don't let it through at once (not sure ^^) 

And God knows 
That it's hard to find the one 
But in time, 
All the flowers turn to face the sun
                        
                    |
