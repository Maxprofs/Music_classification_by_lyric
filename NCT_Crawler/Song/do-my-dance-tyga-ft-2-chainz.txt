                        [Intro]
*** this pussy boy, *** it!
*** it right boy!
(you know I love it when you)
*** it, *** it right boy

[Hook]
Do my dance on your dick, Ooh you know you love this ***. [x4]
Do my dance on your chick, Ooh you know she love the dick. [x4]

[Verse 1: Tyga]
(Uh)
Lamborghini, you don't even see me
Bad bitch, no bikini taking shots of Henny
Order calamari, say she want that fettucini
5 star bitches, my bitches don't eat at Denny's
Run the city, you runnin' laps trying to get with me
I'm all in her red skin, like I play for Washington
I'm five eight, but six ten, my dick stand like Superman
Shoulder lean that bitch, shoulder lean that bitch
Mills cause I'm hot, trigger finger keep that pussy wet
Bills in my fists, shawty she gon' dance on my dick
Mills cause I'm hot, trigger finger keep that pussy wet
Bills in my fists, shawty she gon' dance on my dick

[Hook]

[Verse 2: 2 Chainz]
(2 Chainz! Uh)
She got her booty cheeks on my Louis sheets
She can do it on a pole, but can she do it on me
Her flexing ass, let me see you flex that ass
I don't call I just text that ass and buy special bags
Python, all gold no ice on
Nothing but shaved pussy in my iPhone
And this right here a no fly zone
And you are not us, so don't try holmes
I buy cars, I buy homes, my antidote for my catapult
I'm up through there, foreign shoes, these a new pair
Chains on, this two pair
Make your girl buy new hair
Wear that pussy out, like new gear (ho)

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Tyga]
*** yeah bitch, throw it back. Don't be scared of it. [x3]
*** yeah bitch, throw it back
(Yea)
Throw it back
(Fat bitch)
Throw it back
(Yea, yea)
Throw it back
(Dank bitch)
Don't be scared of it

[Outro]
Do my dance on your dick, Ooh you know you love this ***. [x3]
Do my dance on your chick, Ooh you know she love the dick

*** it right boy
*** it right boy
*** it, *** it right boy
*** it right boy
*** it, *** it right boy
