                        Bài hát: Close - Nick Jonas, Tove Lo

Oh damn, oh damn, oh damn
I'm so perplexed
With this one breath, I'm locked in
Oh damn, oh damn, oh damn
I'm so perplexed
Oh that, it's almost shocking 
I know, I know you, know you're scared
Your heart, your mind, your soul, your body
They won't, they won't, they won't be careful
But I guess that you don't know me

Cause if I want you, and I want you, babe
Ain't going backwards, won't ask for space
Cause space it just a word made up by someone who's get afraid to get too ...

Close, uhuhhh..
Oh, so close, uhuhhh...
I want you close, uhuhhh...
Cause space it just a word made up by someone who's get afraid to get 
Close uhuhhh...
Oh, so close, uhuhhh...
I want you close, uhuhhh...
Oh, I want you close, and close ain't close enough, no

Oh man, oh man
I'm not really known for ever being speechless
But now, but now somehow
My words roll off my tongue right onto your lips, oh
I'm keeping cool while you keep smiling
Saying all the things I'm thinking
Oh man, oh man
I am like you so I want proof of what you're feeling

Cause if I want you, and I want you, babe
Ain't going backwards, won't ask for space
Cause space it just a word made up by someone who's get afraid to get too ...

Close, uhuhhh...
Oh, so close, uhuhhh....
I want you close, uhuhhh...
Cause space it just a word made up by someone who's get afraid to get close, oh
Oh, so close, uhuhhh...
I want you close, uhuhhh...
Oh, I want you close, and close ain't close enough, no

Cause if I want you, and I want you, babe
Ain't going backwards, won't ask for space
Cause space it just a word made up by someone who's get afraid to get too ...

Close, uhuhhh...
Oh, so close, uhuhhh...
I want you close, uhuhhh...
Cause space it just a word made up by someone who's get afraid to get... 
Close, uhuhhh...
Oh, so close, uhuhhh...
I want you close, uhuhhh...
Oh, I want you close, and close ain't close enough, no
Close...close...close...
Oh, I want you close, and close ain't close enough, no
