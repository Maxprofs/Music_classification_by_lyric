                        [All]
 When I get older
 I will be stronger
 They'll call me freedom
 Just like a wavin flag

 [K'naan]
 Born from a throne
 Older than Rome
 But violent prone
 Poor people zone

 [Nelly Furtado]
 But it's my home
 All I have known

 [Sam Roberts]
 Where I got grown
 But now it's gone

 [Avril Lavigne]
 Out of the darkness
 In came the carnage
 Threatening my very survival

 [Pierre Bouvier of Simple]
 Fractured my streets
 And broke all my dreams

 [Tyler Connolly of Theory of a Deadman]
 Feels like defeat to wretched retreat

 [All]
 So we strugglin'

 [Kardinal Offishall]
 Fighting to eat

 [All]
 And we wonderin'

 [Kardinal Offishall]
 If we'll be free

 [Jully Black]
 We cannot wait for some faithful day
 It's too far away so right I'll say

 [All - Chorus]
 When I get older
 I will be stronger
 They'll call me freedom
 Just like a waving flag
 (And then it goes back x3)

 Ahhho ahhho ahhho

 [Lights]
 So many wars, settling scores

 [Deryck Whibley of Sum 41]
 All that we've been through
 And now there is more

 [Serena Ryder]
 I hear them say love is the way

 [Jacob Hoggard of Hedley]
 Love is the answer that's what they say

 [Emily Haines]
 But were not just dreamers
 Of broken down grievers

 [Hawsley Workman]
 Our hand will reach us
 And we will not see ya

 [Drake]
 This can't control us
 No it can't hold us down

 [Chin Injeti]
 We gon pick it up even though we still struggling
 [Pierre Lapointe]
 Au nom de la survie (In the name of survival)

 [All]
 And we wondering
 [Pierre Lapointe]
 Battant pour nos vie (Fighting for our lives)

 [All]
 We patiently wait
 For some other day
 [Fefe Dobson and Esthero]
 That's too far away so right now we say

 [All - Chorus]

 [Drake - Rapping]
 Uhh â€“ well alright
 How come when the media stops covering
 And there's a little help from the government
 We forget about the people still struggling
 And assume that it's really all love again, nahh
 See we don't have to wait for things to break apart
 If you weren't involved before it's never too late to start
 You probably think that it's too far to even have to care
 Well take a look at where you live what if it happened there?
 You have to know the urge to make a change lies within
 And we can be the reason that we see the flag rise again

 [Nikki Yanofsky & Drake]
 When I get older
 I will be stronger
 They'll call me freedom
 Just like a wavin' flag

 [15]
 And then it goes back

 [Justin Nozuka]
 And then it goes back

 [Nikki Yanofsky]
 Then it goes back

 [Chorus - All] [x2]
 When I get older
 I will be stronger
 They'll call me freedom
 Just like a waving flag
 (And then it goes back x3)

 [Justin Bieber]
 When I get older
 When I get older
 I will be stronger
 Just like a waving flag.
