                        Bài hát : I See Fire - Ed Sheeran

Oh Misty eye of the mountain below,
Keep careful watch of my brothers souls,
And should the sky be filled with fire and smoke
Keep watching over Durin's sons.

If this is to end in fire
Then we should all burn together
Watch the flames climb high into the night.
Calling out Father Oh
Stand by and we will
Watch the flames burn on,
burn on the mountainside
(High)

And if we should die tonight
Then we should all die together
Raise a glass of wine
For the last time
Calling out Father Oh
Prepare as we will
Watch the flames burn on burn on the mountainside
Desolat ion comes upon the sky

Now I see fire
Inside the mountain
I see fire
Burning the trees
And I see fire
Hollow in soul
I see fire
Blood in the breeze
And I hope that you remember me

Oh should my people fall
Then surely I'll do the same
Confined in mountain halls
We got too close to the flame
Calling out Father Oh
Holdfast and we will
Watch the flames burn on,
Burn on the mountainside
Desolat ion comes upon the sky

Now I see fire
Inside the mountain
I see fire
Burning the trees
And I see fire
Hollow in soul
I see fire
Blood in the breeze
And I hope that you remember me

And if the night is burning
I'll Cover my eyes
For if the dark returns
Then my brothers will die
And as the sky is falling down
It crashed into this lonely town
And with that shadow upon the ground
I hear my people screaming out

I see fire
Inside the mountain
I see fire
Burning the trees
And I see fire
Hollow in soul
I see fire
Blood in the breeze

I see fire (Oh you know I saw a city burning)
Fire
I see fire (Feel the heat upon my skin)
Fire
I see fire (Ooh)
Fire
And I see fire burn on,
burn on the mountainside
                        
                    |
