                        Bài hát: Just Between You And I (Lời Cuối Cho Tình Yêu) - V.A

Goodbye my love
So many times I told you we had to say goodbye in the end
Don't wanna go to hurt him again
So many times I told you we had to face the pain again
The day we go out separate ways

But now that I , that I feel I am confused
that I can't stop missing you
I wish you were here, wish you were here
to light-up my life again
Ohh,I want you to be mine
to the end of time
The love trust between you and I

If I were to revive love
won't you hold me once again
maybe it helps to bring back those memories
I might come to remember
the love we share together
I might not love you any more

If I were to revive love
won't you hold me once again
maybe it hurts to bring back the memories
I might come to remember
the love we share together
I might not love you any more
                        
                    |
