                        Bài hát : Bitty Boppy Betty - Pink Martini

Bitty Boppy Betty (x3)
Boo boo
On weekends choose your honey
Then comes Monday
And that'll be "sir" to you
Bitty Boppy Betty

Better known as Billy
He's the up-an-coming local D.A.
A fearless crimefighter
Political insider
Sure to be mayor one day

But after work on Fridays
Off comes his necktie
And on come her daimonds and pearls!
You better get ready
'cuz now Billy's Betty


Everybody's favorite girl!
The underbelly of the city
That's where you'll find Betty
Friday to Sunday night
Is she working undercover?
Or just a fun lover?
Either way that's alright
Bitty Boppy Betty

What a bouncin' beauty
So sophisticated and refined
She's a boy who doesn't show it
And although the guys all know it
None of them seems to mind
When Betty starts a-boppin'
The joint starts a-hoppin'
She can twist and bend the whole 


night through
You really can't ignore her
And if you don't adore her
There might be something wrong with you
On Mondays, bright and early,

Betty's back to Billy
Working hard on behalf of our town
Upholding law and ordertalking to reporters
and keeping us safe and sound

If there's a moral to this ditty
It's not to judge Betty,Billy, or anyone
'Cuz life's alot richer
with a healthy mixture

not to mention lots more fun
Bitty Boppy Betty (x3)
Boo boo
On weekends choose your honey
Then comes Monday
And that'll be "sir" to you
                        
                    |
