                        Hey baby girl
I've been watching you all day
Man that thing you got behind you is amazing
You make me want to take you out and let it rain
I know you got a man but this is what you should say

CHORUS:
Why don't you tell him that I'm leavin' never lookin back again
You found somebody who does it better than he can
No more making you cry, no more them gray skies
Girl we flying on the G-5 G-5
And I'm leavin' never lookin back again...
So call your shawty you tell him you found a new man
The one who's so so fly
The one to keep you high
Have you singing all night, like that
Oh oh oh (repeat) man she going to be sayin'
Oh oh oh oh (repeat)

Now if I talk it girl, you know that I will walk it out
Man I'll put my money (money) where my mouth is
Cause you the baddest litte thing that I've ever seen
So ima ask you one time if you got a man

CHORUS:
Why don't you tell him that I'm leavin' never lookin back again
You found somebody who does it better than he can
No more making you cry, no more them gray skies
Girl we flying on the G-5 G-5
And I'm leavin' never lookin back again...
So call your shawty you tell him you found a new man
The one who's so so fly
The one to keep you high
Have you singing all night, like that
Oh oh oh (repeat) man she going to be sayin'
Oh oh oh oh (repeat)

Don't stress, don't stress, don't stress
Just tell him to the left left left
Don't stress, don't stress, don't stress
Cause we gone

No stress,no stress, no stress
Girl you deserve nothin' but the best
Don't stress, dont stress, don't stress
Girl you need to tell him that

CHORUS:
Why don't you tell him that I'm leavin' never lookin back again
You found somebody who does it better than he can
No more making you cry, no more them gray skies
Girl we flying on the G-5 G-5
And I'm leavin' never lookin back again...
So call your shawty you tell him you found a new man
The one who's so so fly
The one to keep you high
Have you singing all night, like that
Oh oh oh (repeat) man she going to be sayin'
Oh oh oh oh (repeat)
