                        If you miss the train I'm on,
you will know that I am gone,
you can hear the whistle blow a hundred miles.
A hundred miles, a hundred miles,
a hundred miles, a hundred miles,
you can hear the whistle blow a hundred miles.

Lord, I'm one, Lord, I'm two, Lord,
I'm three, Lord, I'm four, Lord,
I'm five hundred miles a way from home.
Away from home, away from home,
away from home, away from home,
Lord, I'm five hundred miles away from home.

Not a shirt on my back,
not a penny to my name.
Lord, I can't go back home this-a way.
This-a way, this-a way,
this-a way, this-a way,
Lord, I can't go back home this-a way.

If you miss the train I'm on,
you will know that I am gone,
you can hear the whistle blow a hundred miles.
A hundred miles, a hundred miles,
a hundred miles, a hundred miles,
you can hear the whistle blow a hundred miles
