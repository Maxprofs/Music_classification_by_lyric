                        Bài Hát: Perfect For You - Rachel Platten

I'm flood, I'm flood
I know this
You like me it's my doses
What am I suppose to do with that
Ya, ya, oh

You say I bring the drama
Like you got halo zonya
Have to talk to my exhibit
Ya, ya, oh

I'm wild and just insane
I'm scared but I don't wanna wait (you do)
It's pissing me of when you say
Calm down, calm down like that
You know that I'll hit it for real
And you know everything that I feel
That to me, it is a big deal
So don't come [?] me like that

And it's true
I can't seem to shake it lose
Cause all this is curiosity
Hurtin' me as I'm trying to be perfect for you
I'm done to break the rules
There's so much time I've wasted
I'm chasin' and face it
I cannot be perfect for you
Be perfect for you
Be perfect for you
Be perfect, ya I cannot be perfect for you

I wear emotions on my sleeve
I say exactly what I mean
Isn't that real enough for you
Ya, ya, oh

I got no shame I'm just myself
Won't change for you
And no one else is make me feeling I''m not enough when I am

I'm wild and just insane
I'm scared but I don't run away (you do)
It's pissing me of when you say
Calm down, calm down like that
You know that I'll hit it for real
And you know everything that I feel
That to me, it is a big deal
So don't come [?] me like that

And it's true
I can't seem to shake it lose
Cause all this is curiosity
Hurtin' me as I'm trying to be perfect for you

I'm done to break the rules
There's so much time I've wasted
I'm chasin' and face it
I cannot be perfect for you
Be perfect for you
Be perfect for you
Be perfect, ya I cannot be perfect for you
Be perfect for you
Be perfect for you
Be perfect, ya I cannot be perfect for you

So love me and leave me alone
So love me and leave me alone
So love me and leave me alone
So love me and leave me alone

And it's true
I can't seem to shake it lose
Cause all this is curiosity
Hurtin' me as I'm trying to be perfect for you

I'm done to break the rules
There's so much time I've wasted
I'm chasin' and face it
I cannot be perfect for you
Be perfect for you, so love me and leave me alone be perfect for you
Be perfect, ya I cannot be perfect for you
Be perfect for you
Be perfect for you (so love me and leave me alone)
Be perfect, ya I cannot be perfect for you
