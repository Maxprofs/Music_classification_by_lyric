                        [M:] God damn, **** it's hot as ****
 [M:] Roll down the windows, turn on the ac or turn on some music or something, **** you got me ****ed up
 [F:] Let me see what's on the radio
 [Dj Mustard songs playing on every radio channel]
 [M:] **** I'm tired of this ***, I'm tired of this ****a

 Mustard - 92. 3 [?] radio, it's a beautiful day in the city right now
 I know everyone's out doing their thing, it's summertime, but I need all my s*** independent single ladies,
 If you don't need a ****a for *** call me up right now, like right ****in' now

 Would it be a mistake if I put it down on you?
 I'm not into games I've been feeling lonely, so are you
 We should do the damn thing
 Let me hit the shower, are you comin' through?
 Give me about an hour and I'll be ready [?]
 **** You talkin' 'bout? We don't even speak, we just do the nasty
 That way we make a [?]
 Used to love to see my ****a happy even though you brought baggage
 Did everything you asked me but you was gettin' ratchet
 Now we got damage, you let these other ****es have it
 You let these other ****es have it
 You let these other ****es have it
 You let these other ****es have it
