Björk Jóga Lyrics

all the accidents that happen
follow the dot
coincidence makes sense
only with you
you don't have to speak - I feel
emotional landscapes
they puzzle me
then the riddle gets solved
and you push me up to this
state of emergency
how beautiful to be
state of emergency
is where I want to be

all that no-one sees
you see
what's inside of me
every nerve that hurts
you heal
deep inside of me
you don't have to speak - I feel
emotional landscapes
they puzzle me
confuse
then the riddle gets solved
and you push me up to this
state of emergency
how beautiful to be
state of emergency
is where I want to be
......
Emotional landscapes,
They puzzle me,
Then the riddle gets solved,
And you push me up to this
State of emergency,
How beautiful to be,
State of emergency,
Is where I want to be.
State of emergency,
How beautiful to be,
State of emergency,

State of, state of,
How beautiful,
Emergency,
Is where I want to be.
State of emergency,
How beautiful to be,
State of emergency,
Is where I want to be.
State of emergency,
How beautiful to be.
