                        I've always been the kind of girl
that hid my face
so afraid to tell the world
what i've got to say
but i have this dream
bright inside of me
i'm gonna let it show
it's time to let you know
to let you know...
CHORUS
This is real this is me
i'm exactly where i'm supposed
to be now
Gonna let the light shine on me
now i've found who i am
There's no way to hold it in
no more hiding who i want to be
this is me

Do you know what it's like
to feel so in the dark
to dream about a life
where you're the shining star

Even though it seems
like it's too far away
i have to believe
in myself. it's the only way
CHORUS
This is real this is me
i'm exactly where i'm supposed
to be now
gonna let the light shine on me
now i've found who i am
there's no way to hold it in
no more hiding who i want to be
this is me

You're the voice i hear inside my head
the reason that i'm singin'
i need to find you
i gotta find you

you're the missing piece i need
the sone inside of me
i need to find you
i gotta find you
CHORUS
this is real this is me
i'm exactly where i'm supposed
to be now
gonna let the light shine on me
now i've found who i am
there's no way to hold it in
no more hiding who i want to be
this me

This is me...This is me...

you're the missing piece i need
the song inside of me

you're the voice i hear inside me head
the reason that i'm singin'

there's no way to hold it in
no more hiding who i want to be
This is me
