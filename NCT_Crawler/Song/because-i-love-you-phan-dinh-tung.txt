                        Bài Hát: Because I Love You - Phan Đinh Tùng

*
Night goes down
I’m sitting here alone
Remembering your love
All the time we share
are far away
Why did you have to go away
Days go by
shadow fades away
A flame in love’s just gone
But if in my soul
I want you back
Ohm my love
will you come in back

Although our love seems
to be within thin air
Although our promise mean
to share us into pieces
Although our prayers fail
to keep in us in whole
Although often had me cold
Please tell me in this life
I’m the only one you love
only our love is well
your love is ever mine
Forever our love shadow
                        
                    |
