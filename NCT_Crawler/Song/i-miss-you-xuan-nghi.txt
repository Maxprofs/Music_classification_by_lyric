                        Bài hát: I Miss You - Xuân Nghi

The time is now
And it's always running
It's too fast to hold you on tight
Now I don't have you
have you around me
I miss you, miss you so much
You arrived to the world
you were staying with me
Till you're not here anymore
Still have you in my heart
Still have you in my mind
I miss you, miss you so much
I miss you, miss you so much

Are you happy in there
Like you're happy in here
I know that there's nothing up than the heaven
In the cold night, dark night, loneliness around me
But I know that we're around each other

In the childhood we played
we'll staying here all day
The small ball
the little doll anything we're been through
In the cold night, dark night
loneliness around you
But I know that we're around each other

Hey baby, you my friend
Close your eyes and lean on me
I miss you, miss you so much
I miss you, miss you so much
                        
                    |
