I don't know how I servived 
In the cold and empty world 
For all this time. 
I only know that I'm alive 
Because you loved me. 
when I recall what I've been through 
There's some things that I wish i couldn't do 
And now I do the thing I do
Because you loved me 

And now that you're in my life 
I'm so glad I'm alive 
cause you showed me the way 
And I know now how good it can be 
Because you love me 

And known that you're in my life 
I'm so glad I'm alive 
'cause you showed me the way 
And I know now how good it can be 
Because you loved me 

I believe in things unseen 
I believe in the massage of a dreams 
And I believe in what you are 
Because you loved me 
With all my heart and all my soul 
I'm loving you and I never will let go 
And every day I'll let it show 
Because you loved me 
Because you loved me 
Because you loved me



Long time no talk to U - Mint @@
