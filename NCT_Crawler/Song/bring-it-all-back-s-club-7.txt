                        Don't stop never give up
Hold your head high and reach the top
Let the world see what you have got
Bring it all back to you.

Hold on to what you try to be, your individuality
When the world is on your shoulders
Just smile and let it go.
When people try to put you down
Just walk on by don't turn around
You only have to answer to yourself.

Don't you know it's true what they say
That life it ain't easy.
But your time's coming around
So don't you stop tryin'

[Chorus]
Don't stop never give up
Hold your head high and reach the top
Let the world see what you have got
Bring it all back to you.
Dream of falling in love
Anything you've been thinking of
When the world seems to get too tough
Bring it all back to you.

(na na na na na.....)

Try not to worry 'bout a thing,
Enjoy the good times life can bring
Don't keep it all inside you
Gotta let your feelings show.
Imagination is the key
Cos you are your own destiny
You never should be lonely when time
Is on your side.

Don't you know it's true what they say
Things are sent to try you.
But your time's coming around
So don't you stop tryin'

[Repeat Chorus] & (na na na...)

Don't you know it's true what they say
Things happened for a reason
But your time's coming around
So don't you stop tryin'
                        
                    |
