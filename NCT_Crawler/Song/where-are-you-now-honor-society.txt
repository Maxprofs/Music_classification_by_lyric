                        Song: Where Are You Now - Honor Society

To my favorite teacher
Told me never give up
To my fifth grade crush
Who I thought I really love
To the guys I miss
And the girls we kissed
Where are you now

To my ex best friends
Don't know how we grew apart
To my favorite bands
And sings a long in my car
To the face I see
In my memories
Where are you now

[Chorus]
Where are you now
'Cause I'm thinking of you
You show me how
How I live like I do
If it wasn't for you
I would never be who I am.

To my first girlfriend
I thought for sure was the one
To my last girlfriend
Sorry that I crewded up
To the ones I loved
But didn't show it enough
Where are you now

[Chorus]

I know we'll never see those days again
And things never be that way again
But that just how it goes
People change but I know I never forget you

To the one who cared
And who were there from the start
To the love that left
Ã€n took a piece of my heart
To the few who's swear
I'd never go anywhere
Where are you now

[Chorus]

It wasn't for you
I would never be who I am
                        
                    |
