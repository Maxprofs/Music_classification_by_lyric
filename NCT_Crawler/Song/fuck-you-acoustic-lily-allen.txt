                        Bài hát: *** You (Acoustic) - Lily Allen

Look inside, 
Look inside, 
Your tiny mind. 
Then look a bit harder, 
cause we're so uninspired. 
So sick and tired. 
Of all 
The hatred you harbor, 
so you say 
It's not okay to be gay, 
Well I think 
You're just evil. 
You're just some racist. 
Who can't tie my laces, 
You're point of view 
Is me devil. 

*** you, *** you 
Very, very much. 
Cause we hate 
What you do 
And we hate 
Your whole crew 
So please 
Don't stay in touch, 
*** you, *** you 
Very, very much 
Cause your words 
Don't translate 
And it's getting 
Quite late 
So please 
Don't stay in touch. 

Do you get, 
Do you get 
A little kick out. 
Of being small minded 
You want to be 
Like your father 
His approval your after 
Well that's not how 
You'll find it 
Do you 
Do you really enjoy 
Living a life 
That's so hateful 
Cause there's a hole 
Where your soul 
Should be 
You're losing 
Control of it 
And it's really 
Distasteful 

*** you, *** you 
Very, very much 
Cause we hate 
What you do 
And we hate 
Your whole crew 
So please 
Don't stay in touch 
*** you, *** you 
Very, very much 
Cause your words 
Don't translate 
And it's getting 
Quite late 
So please 
Don't stay in touch Look inside 
Look inside 
Your tiny mind 
Then look a bit harder 
Cause we're so uninspired 
So sick and tired 
Of all 
The hatred you harbor 

*** you, *** you 
Very, very much 
Cause we hate 
What you do 
And we hate 
Your whole crew 
So please 
Don't stay in touch 

*** you, *** you 
Very, very much 
Cause your words 
Don't translate 
And it's getting 
Quite late 
So please 
Don't stay in touch
