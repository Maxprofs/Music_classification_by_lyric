[Intro]
Now just picture me high up with my top down
All hauling in the sunset doing 85 on the top deck
See, step by step we walking on stars
If youre looking for some action you aint gotta go that far

[Hook]
Now just picture me Hollywood living,
riding through the sun, riding through the sunset
Now stop tripping, just give me a minute
And wait till the sun, wait till the sun goes down
And you know i ain't go down, and you know i ain't go down
Ill entertain you just wait till the sun goes down
You know i ain't go down, you know i ain't go down
Might get a little crazy just wait till the sun goes down

[Verse 1]
Underground, any city I come in town, its touchdown, hail Mary
Getting to the dough like Pillsbury all night dont feel weary
High up is where we will be
Now you aint gotta feel guilty, wont judge you, go be free.
So po what you want, go ahead ball what you want
*** they say somebody, walk around here like they somebody
Dont know what kind of day I have with all this..
Dont hold me back from my habits, live the fast life fully matic
Im just looking around for the baddest Hollywood face with a ass from Dallas
Big ass crib nigga living in a palace,
We rolling out and my hands on the wheel so tight gotta calis
Ghetto- Fabulous with everybody here only thing that matters

[Hook]
Now just picture me Hollywood living,
riding through the sun, riding through the sunset
Now stop tripping, just give me a minute
And wait till the sun, wait till the sun goes down
And you know how it go down, and you know how it go down
Ill entertain you just wait till the sun goes down
You know how it go down, you know how it go down
Might get a little crazy just wait till the sun goes down

[Verse 2]
When Its go time I swear its feeling like we inches from the goal line
Now whenever better make your mind, might hit her with the lime light
Whats your sign? Hit her with a glass of sparkling wine
Hit her on the ass she might not mind, acting like a ten look more like a nine
But dont be stuck up, really how could you not see us?
Doing it big, its obvious you aint gotta say much
Cause I know youre sick and tired, sick and tired of that bullshit
Then dont be afraid take a shot and bite the bullet
Thats one in the hole cant get enough need one or two more
Tell em catch up they running too slow, out the gutter I learn to bowl
And finally its movie time to show them I play the role of a champion
You see the gold like shine bright cant see the row..

[Hook]
Now just picture me Hollywood living,
riding through the sun, riding through the sunset
Now stop tripping, just give me a minute
And wait till the sun, wait till the sun goes down
And you know how it go down, and you know how it go down
Ill entertain you just wait till the sun goes down
You know how it go down, you know how it go down
Might get a little crazy just wait till the sun goes down
