                        Bài hát: This Is Nightlife - Italobrothers

This is nightlife
This is nightlife
I like, I like, I like it loud
When I enter the club
I’m with my crowd
Drinking shots and champagne
The girls get proud being VIP
The heat is up
Come on and freak with me

‘Cause when we’re out on the floor
Dj give us some more
And turn up the base now
We wanna dance till we drop
Tonight we do it all over and over again

This is nightlife
We dance under the moonlight
And party till we feel high
We’re ready for the good times
All over the nation
We have a celebration
And party till we feel high
We’re ready for the good life

This is nightlife
We dance under the moonlight
And party till we feel high
We’re ready for the good times
All over the nation
We have a celebration
And party till we feel high
We’re ready for the good life

This is nightlife
We know how to party

I’m a bad boy
And I’m coming around to be your toy
And we’ll be playing for fun
My little bad girl
I’m up for anything in the party world
And get your ass in the ring

‘Cause when we’re out on the floor
Dj give us some more
And turn up the bass now
We wanna dance till we drop
Tonight we do it all over and over again

This is nightlife
We dance under the moonlight
And party till we feel high
We’re ready for the good times
All over the nation
We have a celebration
And party till we feel high
We’re ready for the good life
