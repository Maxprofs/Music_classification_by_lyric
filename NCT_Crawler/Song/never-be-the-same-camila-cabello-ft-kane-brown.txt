                        Bài hát: Never Be The Same - Camila Cabello, Kane Brown

[Verse 1: Camila Cabello]
Something must've gone wrong in my brain
Got your chemicals all in my veins
Feeling all the highs, feeling all the pain
Let go on the wheel, it’s the bullet lane
Now I'm seeing red, not thinking straight
Blurring all the lines, you intoxicate me

[Pre-Chorus: Camila Cabello]
Just like nicotine, heroin, morphine
Suddenly, I'm a fiend and you're all I need
All I need, yeah, you're all I need

[Chorus: Camila Cabello]
It's you, babe
And I'm a sucker for the way that you move, babe
And I could try to run, but it would be useless
You're to blame
Just one hit of you, I knew I'll never be the same
It's you, babe
And I'm a sucker for the way that you move, babe
And I could try to run, but it would be useless
You're to blame
Just one hit of you, I knew I'll never ever, ever be the same

[Post-Chorus: Camila Cabello & Kane Brown]
I'll never be the same
I'll never be the same
I'll never be the same
Never be the same

[Verse 2: Kane Brown]
Sneaking in L.A. when the lights are low
Off of one touch, I could overdose
You said, "Stop playing it safe
Boy, I wanna see you lose control"

[Pre-Chorus: Camila Cabello, Kane Brown, Both]
Just like nicotine, (nicotine) heroin, morphine (morphine)
Suddenly, I'm a fiend and you're all I need (all I need)
All I need, yeah, you're all I need

[Chorus: Camila Cabello, Kane Brown, Both]
It's you, babe
And I'm a sucker for the way that you move, babe
And I could try to run, but it would be useless
You're to blame
Just one hit of you, I knew I'll never be the same
It's you, babe
And I'm a sucker for the way that you move, babe
And I could try to run, but it would be useless
You're to blame, you're to blame
Just one hit of you, I knew I'll never ever, ever be the same

[Post-Chorus: Camila Cabello & Kane Brown]
I'll never be the same
Never be the same, girl
I'll never be the same
I'll never be the same
I'll never be the same
And now

[Bridge: Camila Cabello, Kane Brown, Both]
You're in my blood, you're in my veins, you're in my head (I blame)
You're in my blood, you're in my veins, you're in my head (I'm sayin')

[Chorus: Camila Cabello, Kane Brown, Both]
It's you, babe
And I'm a sucker for the way that you move, babe
And I could try to run, but it would be useless
You're to blame (you're to blame)
Just one hit of you, I knew I'll never be the same
It's you, babe
And I'm a sucker for the way that you move, babe
And I could try to run, but it would be useless
You're to blame, you're to blame
Just one hit of you, I knew I'll never ever, ever be the same
