                        Bài hát: Love Is The Arrow - Air Supply

So many miles it seems
Nothing can come between, your life and mine
Before the ink is dry
I feel just you and i, inside my mind

Love is the arrow, fly straight and true
Into this deep and fallow hart
What am i to do
What am i to do

Another world to spin
A distant tide come in, they always do
A mother holds the son
A lover waits alone, like me for you

Love is the arrow, fly straight and true
Into this deep and fallow hart
What am i to do, what am i to do

Into the highest cloud
Before a word is spoken
Beyond the slighest doubt
Before the dream is woken
                        
                    |
