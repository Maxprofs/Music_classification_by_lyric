                        There is a house in New Orleans 
It's called the Rising Sun 
It's been the ruin of many a poor boy 
And Lord I know of one 

If he had heard what Daddy said 
He'd be a King today 
But he knew best, what he should do 
And he was on his way 

He soon became a travellin' man 
He's travelled from town to town 
The path he took was good to him 
Till he drank his liquor down 

------ Guitar solo ------ 

Then he woke up *at thirty-five*

Realised what he had done 
Remembered what is daddy said 
'bout the House of the Rising Sun 

There is a house in New Orleans 
It's called the Rising Sun 
*And* it's been the ruin of many a poor boy 
And Lord I know of one 
And Lord I know of one 
Yes I do 
I really know
I know of one 
Yes I do 
I know of one, yea
                        
                    |
