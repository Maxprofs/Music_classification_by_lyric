                        Bài hát: Evil Like Me - Kristin Chenoweth, Dove Cameron

[Mal:]
Look at you, look at me 
I don't know who to be
Mother

Is it wrong, is it right? 
Be a thief in the night 
Mother 

Tell me what to do...

[Maleficent:] 
I was once like you my child
Slightly insecure 
Argued with my mother too 
Thought I was mature
But I put my heart aside
And I used my head 
Now I think it's time you learned 
What dear old momma said

Don't you wanna be evil like me?
Don't you wanna be mean?
Don't you wanna make mischief your daily routine? 

Well you can spend your life attending to the poor 
But when you're evil doing less is doing more 

Don't you wanna be ruthless and rotten and mad?
Don't you wanna be very, very good at being bad? 

I have tried my whole life long to do the worst I can
Clawed my way to victory
Built my master plan 
Now the time has come my dear for you to take your place
Promise you will try to be an absolute disgrace 

Don't you wanna be evil like me?
Don't you wanna be cruel?
Don't you wanna be nasty and brutal and cool? 

And when you grab that wand that's when your reign begins
Who wants an evil queen without a sack of sins? 

Don't you wanna be heartless and hardin' as stone? 
Don't you wanna be finger licking' evil to the bone? 

This was not for us to ponder 
This was preordained 
You and I shall rule together
Freedom soon regain 
Mistress of the universe, powerful and strong 

Daughter, hear me 
Help me, join me

Won't you sing along? 

[Both:]
Now we're gonna be evil it's true
Never gonna think twice 

[Mal:] 
And we're gonna be spiteful 

[Maleficent:]
Yes, spiteful 
That's nice 

In just an hour or two 
Our futures safe and sure 

This mother, daughter act is going out on tour 

If you wanna be evil and awful and free
Then you should thank your lucky star 
That you were born the girl you are
The daughter of an evilicious queen 

Like me!
