                        Bài hát: That Is Love - Tokyo Square

Look into your dark blue eyes
I can feel you searching my heart
You’ll find there’s no need to hide
We know that is love

Now I’m looking through your heart
I can tell you that it is true love
Thank you for the time we have
We know that is love

Don’t tell me that love’s not waiting for us
If we really want to we can try
But you and I gotta make it happen
Since we know that is love
Don’t tell me that love’s not waiting for us
If we really want to we can try
What you’ve done
We know that is love

Everytime when I think of you
It’s always thing goes into my mind
I just want to hold you close
We know that is love

Yes I want to share my dream
And I hope that you’ll be there
Please do love me like before
We know that is love

Now I’m looking through your heart
I can tell you that it is true love
Thank you for the time we have
We know that is love
                        
                    |
