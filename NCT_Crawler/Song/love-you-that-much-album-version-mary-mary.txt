                        [Hook:]
 If you tell me to go I'm gonna tell you I will,
 'cause I love you that much
 If you tell me to stay and be still I will,
 'cause I love you that much
 Tell me what to say even if I'm afraid I will,
 'cause I love you that much
 It doesn't matter, whatever, whenever I will, 'cause I love you that much

 [Verse:]
 Now a days everybody wants to be in control
 Tryna be a leader when they've never even really followed
 Got no information and no direction and way too much pride
 When it ain't that hard to just ask the lord to be your guide

 [Hook:]

 [Verse 2:]
 One love and one heart, one God who gives it away
 Most folks they don't wanna believe that today
 But i'll take your love and i'll give my love all to you completely 'cause
 I trust in you and I believe that you know what's best for
 Me
 [Hook:]

 [Bridge:]
 I will always trust in the fact that
 You got me in the palm of your hand
 Use me how you will
 No matter how I feel
 'cause there's no way that
 I could know you put the sun in the sky
 I could know you hung the moon for the night
 Still not wanna trust ya
 Well that wouldn't be right so I'm saying

 [Hook:]
