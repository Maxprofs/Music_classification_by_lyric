[00:-07.52]David Archuleta - A Thousand Miles
[00:-00.02]
Making my way downtown
Walking fast
Faces passed
And I′m home bound

Staring blankly ahead
Just making my way
Making my way
Through the crowd

Now I need you

Now I miss you

And now I wonder

If I could fall

Into the sky

Do you think time
Would pass me by
Cause you know I′d walk
A thousand miles
If I can
Just see you
Tonight

It′s always times like these
When I think of you
And I wonder
If you ever
Think of me

Cause everything′s so wrong
And I don′t belong
Living in your precious memories

Cause I need you

Cause I miss you

And now I wonder
If I could fall
Into the sky
Do you think time
Would pass me by
Cause you know I′d walk
A thousand miles
If I can
Just see you

Tonight

And I, I
Just wanna let you know
I, I
Drown in your memory
I, I
Don′t wanna let this go
I, I
Don′t

Making my way downtown
Walking fast
Faces passed
And I′m home bound

Staring blankly ahead
Just making my way
Making my way
Through the crowd

And I still need you

I still miss you
And now I wonder

If I could fall
Into the sky
Do you think time
Would pass us by
Cause you know I′d walk
A thousand miles
If I could
Just see you

If I could fall
Into the sky
Do you think time
Would pass me by
Cause you know I′d walk
A thousand miles
If I could
Just see you

If I could
Just hold you

Tonight
