                        I gotta turn this car around
 I never should have left you there
 Boy this traffic is making me sick
 Boy I can't wait to have you near I gotta hurry, hurry, hurry
 Now quick, quick, quick
 Just step on the gas 'cause I don't wanna miss this
 This opportunity will only come once in my life, my life I gotta hurry, hurry, hurry
 Now quick, quick, quick
 Just step on the gas 'cause I don't wanna miss this
 See what you're bringin' me boy is priceless
 I gotta be out of my mind not to try this Through strength I found love
 In time I found myself in happiness with you
 Through strength I found love
 In time I found myself in happiness with you Boy, I need to say what's in my heart
 I was scared but I'll do my part
 I came back to tell you face to face
 So what we have won't go to waste I gotta hurry, hurry, hurry
 Now quick, quick, quick
 Just step on the gas 'cause I don't wanna miss this
 This opportunity will only come once in my life, my life yeah Sorry, sorry, sorry, I'm coming down to fix this
 You should know how I feel, I know I got you twisted
 See what you're bringin' me boy is priceless
 I gotta be out of my mind not to try this Through strength I found love
 In time I found myself in happiness with you
 Through strength I found love
 In time I found myself in happiness with you The things that you can give to me
 I can feel it when you're holding me close
 You're like one of the world wonders
 I know I'm going under Come see that I'm ready for this
 And you're so good for me
 You're my true joy
 You make me wanna say Through strength I found love
 In time I found myself in happiness with you
 Through strength I found love
 In time I found myself in happiness with you
