                        Was a fool with my money
 And I lost every dime
 And the sun stopped shining
 And it rained all time
 Oh it did set me back some
 But I made it through
 But I never get over losing you Do you know how much mean to me
 Should have told you 'cause it's true
 I'd get over losing anything
 But I'll never get over losing you When you're young and there's time
 You forget the past
 You don't think that you will but you do
 But I know that I don't have time enough
 But I'll never get over losing you I've been cold, I've been hungry
 But now for a while, I guess most of my dreams have come true
 With that home here around me, no peace do I find
 'Cause I'll never get over losing you
 No I'll never get over losing you
                        
                    |
