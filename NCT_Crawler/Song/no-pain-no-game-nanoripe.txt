                        Saihate no STORY idaite
Ate mo naku samayoi tsuzuketa
Nijinda new world
The game has only just begun
Ima hajimari no EYES

This is where tomorrow brings a new game
it's time to learn that pain is gain ready FIGHT

Kako no shitsubou nuritsubusu tame ni
Gisei ni shite kita mirai
Boku no RAIFU ga tsukiru made
Sono sadame buchikowashite iku no sa

Aa break out and start a revolution
Hitotsu no kotae wo sagashite

Genkai no RACE ni idonde
Ichidokiri no CHANSU to shitte
Seotta unmei koete yukunda yo
Saihate no STORY idaite
Ate mo naku samayoi tsuzuketa
Nijinda new world
The game has only just begun
Ima hajimari no EYES

When you feel you've reached the last dead end
what will you do to save yourself from fate?
Would you take a knife into your heart
or would you rather break the fall and take defeat?

Aa step out and find your evolution

Eien no CHASE ni idonde
Ichidokiri no SUTAATO wo kitte
Kurutta tenmei koete yukunda yo
Karehateta IMEEJI idaite
Wake mo naku tatakai tsuzuketa
Kasunda true world
The game has only just begun
Ima hajimari no DAYS

Genjitsu to FAKE no hazama de
Ichido dake RISETTO yurushite
Sukui wa kitto kokoro no naka ni
Saihate no STORY idaite
Ate mo naku samayoi tsuzuketa
Nijinda new world
The game has only just begun
Ima hajimari no EYES
