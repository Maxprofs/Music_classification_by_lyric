                        Bài hát : Tonight's So Cold - Lâm Nhật Tiến

First time I saw you standing there
I felt a magic in the air
I tried so hard to run away
You simply ordered me to stay

(Tonight I need your love)

And now I need you more and more
Take a look in my eyes
You'll see love's been hurt

Tonight's so cold inside my room
I close my eyes and feel blue
I talk with shadows on the wall
They know that I still wait for you

Tonight's so cold inside my room
I close my eyes and feel blue
I talk with shadows on the wall
Tonight's so cold inside my room

And now I sit here by the phone
Why don't you call? I'm here alone
I hear some footsteps on the floor
But it's the neighbour, locked his door

(Tonight I need your love)

And now I'm crying in the dark
Oh I wish you were here
To heal the pain in my heart

Tonight's so cold inside my room
I close my eyes and feel blue
I talk with shadows on the wall
They know that I still wait for you

Tonight's so cold inside my room
I close my eyes and feel blue
I talk with shadows on the wall
Tonight's so cold inside my room

Maybe someday you'll be free (you'll be free)
Take all your dreams you can share with me
I know together we'll be strong (we'll be strong)
No more sadness, no more fears

Tonight's so cold inside my room
I close my eyes and feel blue
I talk with shadows on the wall
They know that I still wait for you... [fade
