Freal luv 
Freal luv 
Freal luv 
Freal luv 
Know no limits, to feel the truth 
When the world stops spinning, I'll know it's you 
Searching all night, like a spotlight 
For the one to show 
Could it be you? Could it be me? 
Only way to know 
I'm not yours, when you really want to take me there 
Don't let me go no where 
I'd give it all up for you, I swear 
Only Freal luv 
That love that keeps me shaking 
So real there's no mistaking 
I'd give it all up for you, I swear 
Only Freal luv 
Lovin that real luv, something you feel luv 
Turning me back to the old me 
Ride for my realla, 
I die for my realla 
I give you respect like the OGs 
Lockin me down like the police 
We ain't never be lonely 
Protectin' my love like a goalie 
You'll be the one next to me right with the homies 
We got that empire mind, combine n' steadily rise 
(That be freal ) 
Moment of truth of has arrived, trust that forever you ride 
(That be freal ) 
You be the bank on my side, you supervise, 
Lets make a deal, 
Let's get it sealed 
let's make a trill 
Let's rule the world, together freal
