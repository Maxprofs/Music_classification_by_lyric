                        You saw me sitting in the corner
 And you just sat there right next to me.
 You asked me - "Are you feeling lonely?"
 Well loneliness is just a word, you see.

 I came in here just for the music
 For all the things that it makes me feel.
 I came to exorcise my demons
 To bury those days when only pain was real.

 Treat me right
 My dreams will come true tonight.
 Come with me, set me free
 We'll be alright.

 I should have met you in the 80's
 Back when I was the dance floor queen.
 Maybe you think that I'm too old for dancing
 You should have met me when I was sixteen, oh baby

 Dance, Dance, Dance, Dance, Dance, Dance
 You know what I mean
 Dance, Dance, Dance, Dance
 Like you were sixteen.

 Hey! Hey! Hey! 

 Tonight I'm drinking myself sober
 'Till I see what I want to see.
 A few more drinks and you will be the perfect lover
 You will be the one that I, truely believe.

 That is right
 My dreams will come true tonight.
 Come with me, set me free
 We'll be alright.

 I should have met you in the 80's
 Back when I was the dance floor queen.
 Maybe you think that I'm too old for dancing
 You should have met me when I was sixteen, oh baby

 Dance, Dance, Dance, Dance, Dance, Dance
 Like I was sixteen.
 Dance, Dance, Dance, Dance, Dance, Dance
 You know what I mean.

 Hey! Hey! Hey! 

 I should have met you in the 80's
 Back when I was the dance floor queen.
 Maybe you think that I'm too old for dancing
 You should have met me - I should've kissed you

 I should have kissed you in the 80's
 Back when I was young and free.
 Maybe you think that I'm too old for loving
 Well tonight I'll make you love me.

 Dance, Dance, Dance, Dance, Dance, Dance
 Like you were sixteen.
 Dance, Dance, Dance, Dance, Dance, Dance
 You know what I mean.
