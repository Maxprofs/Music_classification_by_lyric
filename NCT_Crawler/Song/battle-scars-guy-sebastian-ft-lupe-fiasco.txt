                        The wound heals but it never does 
That’s cuz you’re at war with love 
You're at war with love, yeah) 

These battle scars, don’t look like they’re fading 
Don’t look like they’re ever going away 
They ain't never gonna change 
These battle 


Never let a wound ruin me 
But I feel like ruins ruin me 
Arrow holes, they never close from cupid on a shooting spree 
Feeling stupid cuz I know it aint no you and me 
But when you're trying to beat the odds up 
Been trying to keep your nods? up 
And you know that you should know 
And let her go 
But the fear of the unknown 
Holding another lover strong 
Sends you back into the zone 
With no Tom Hanks to bring you home 
Another night of fighting 
On the frontline with a poem 
Trying to write yourself a rightful? 
Maybe chopping up a song? 
To fight the tank syndromes of you being alone) 

I wish I never looked, I wish I never touched 
I wish that I could stop loving you so much 
Cuz I’m the only one that's trying to keep us together 
When all of the signs say that I should forget her 
I wish you weren’t the best, the best I ever had 
I wish that the good outweighed the bad 
Cuz it’ll never be over, until you tell me it's over 

These battle scars, don’t look like they’re fading 
Don’t look like they’re ever going away 
They ain't never gonna change 
These battle scars don’t look like they’re fading 
Don’t look like they’re ever going away 
They ain't never gonna change 
These battle 


You shouldn't have but you said it 
It shouldn't have happened but you let it 
Now you're down on the ground screaming medic 
The only thing that comes is the post-traumatic stresses 
Shields, body armors and vests don't properly work 
Thats why you're in a locker full of hurt? 
The enemy within and all the fires from your friends 
The best medicine is to probably just let her win) 

I wish I couldnt feel 
I wish I couldnt love 
I wish that I could stop cuz it hurts so much 
And I’m the only one that's trying to keep us together 
When all of the signs say that I should forget her 
I wish you weren’t the best, the best I ever had 
I wish that the good outweighed the bad 
Cuz it’ll never be over, until you tell me it's over 

These battle scars, don’t look like they’re fading 
Don’t look like they’re ever going away 
They ain't ever gonna change 
These battle scars, don’t look like they’re fading 
Don’t look like they’re ever going away 
They aint ever gonna change 
These battle 

Cuz you've set me on fire 
I’ve never felt so alive, yeah 


Hoping wounds heal, but it never does 
That's becuz you're at war with love) 

And I’m at the point of breaking 
And it’s impossible to shake it, ohw 


See, you hoped the wound heals, but it never does 
That's cuz you're at war with love 
Hope it heals, but it never does 
Thats cuz you're at war with love!) 

These battle scars, don’t look like they’re fading (uhu) 
Don’t look like they’re ever going away 
I aint ever gonna change 
These battle scars, don’t look like they’re fading 
Don’t look like they’re ever going away (never) 
They aint never gonna change (never) 
These battle
