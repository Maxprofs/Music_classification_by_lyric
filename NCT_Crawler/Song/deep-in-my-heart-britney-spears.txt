Ohoh I want you for the rest of my life
Walking through time looking for an answer
How can it be this way
What have I done
I just can't help but wonder
How everything could change
Cause you have turned my world around
Since you came along,no
After this love was found
It seems like we can't go on
Deep in my heart
I know there's only you
And right from the start I always knew
I never let go
Cause I love you so
Ohoh I want you for the rest of my life
Some people search
what seems to be a lifetime
To find a love like this
And here we are
With everything we wished for
I never felt such bliss
Cause you have turned my world around
Since you came along
After this love was found
It seems like we can't go on
Deep in my heart
I know there's only you
And right from the start I always knew
I never let go
Cause I love you so
Ohoh I want you for the rest of my life
There comes a chance in everyones life
And I beleive it won't happen twice
Now since I've felt the glory of love
I want spend forever
(And ever with you)
Deep in my heart
I know there's only you
And right from the start I always knew
I never let go
Cause I love you so
Ohoh
Deep in my heart
I know there's only you
And right from the start I always knew
I never let go
Cause I love you so
Ohoh
Deep in my heart
Deep in my heart
Ohoh I want you for the rest of my life
Ohoh I want you for the rest of my life
