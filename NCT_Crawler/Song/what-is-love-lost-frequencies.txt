                        Bài hát: What Is Love - Lost Frequencies

[Verse 1: Jaymes Young]
Oh, I don't know why you're not there
I give you my love, but you don't care
So what is right and what is wrong?
Give me a sign

[Hook: Jaymes Young] x2
What is love?
Baby, don't hurt me
Baby, don't hurt me
No more

[Verse 2: Jaymes Young]
Oh, I don't know, what can I do?
What else can I say?, it's up to you
I know we're one, just me and you
I can't go on

[Hook: Jaymes Young]x2

[Verse 3: Jaymes Young]
I want no other, no other lover
This is our life, our time
When we are together, I need you forever
Is it love

[Hook: Jaymes Young]
