                        Bài hát: 2 - H.E.R.

[Verse1:]
It's cool
It's really never been that deep
Wasn't thinking about you
Cause you didn't give a about me
Thought I was up in my room
Crying myself to sleep
I was with a better you
While you were busy playing me

[Hook:]
I was playing you 2-2-2
I was playing you 2-2-2

[Verse2:]
Thought I wouldn't find out
Thought I didn't know how to play the game
Could've screamed at you for hours
Instead I was screaming somebody else's name
There were no rules
Now I can do whatever I want
I can never lose
So it's funny how you thought you won

But I was playing you 2-2-2
I was playing you 2-2-2 (x3)

I was playing you
I was playing
I was playing you
Playing you
I was
I was
I was playing you

[Repeat: Hook]
