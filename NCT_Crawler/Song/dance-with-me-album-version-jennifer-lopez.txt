                        Bài hát: Dance With Me (Album Version) - Jennifer Lopez 

Too much is on your mind
Gotta let it go
Can't worry all the time
Just let it flow
You say you need a break
There's nothing I can do
Sitting here listening to you
Baby, what's this you tell me
Things ain't been goin' your way
Just take it from me
It's gonna be alright
So let's go out tonight
And we can leave all our cares behind

Dance the night away
Party 'til the sun comes up
Go grab a friend
Get on the floor
Come on and dance
Dance
Dance with me
DJ if you please

Nobody's on the wall
That's what I like
Come closer to me now and hold me tight
Tell me just how you're feeling right now
Are you really havin' a good time
Baby, what's this you tell me
Thing's ain't been goin' your way
Just take it from me
It's gonna be alright
So let's go out tonight
And we can leave all our cares behind

Dance the night away
Party 'til the sun comes up
Go grab a friend
Get on the floor
Come on and dance
Dance
Dance with me
DJ if you please

Up in the club
Out on the floor
Move to the beat
Dancin' with me
DJ, DJ, play my music
Dance the night away
