                        Bài hát: We Shared The Night - Michael Learns To Rock

Alone with you on naked feet
Creep into your soul
We reached the end of Lonely Street
The end of feeling cold

I have cried a thousand times
I’ve been searching all around me
This time and forever
I know that I have found (the love in me)

We shared the night
We saw the light
Deep in each others eyes
The feeling that lifts us up
That feeling we know is love

Home between your loving hands
With your body next to mine
I believe that we will be together trough the time

I have gone for many walks
I’ve been reeling home from town
This time and forever I know that I have found (the love in me)

We shared the night
We saw the light
Deep in each others eyes
The feeling that lifts us up
That feeling we know is love

Walking through the door
Into a life we’ve been looking for
I’m a brand new soul
In a brand new world
                        
                    |
