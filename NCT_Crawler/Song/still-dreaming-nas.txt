                        Some people really, some people really
 Some people really are
 Still dreaming
 They are still dreaming He pulled up at 6:30 in his 745
 As he wavin' his shorty hi
 You know he showin' his bling out
 She got in the car, he drove, he pulled his thing out His girl call, feelin' she mad, she threw the ring out
 How she found out, she dreamt the whole thing out
 Y'all be goin' through problems you gotta work the kinks out
 When you go to sleep, what do you think 'bout? If y'all get a divorce she gon' take everything except the kitchen sink out
 Make it so cold that you gotta pull ya mink out
 Or grab ya roller skates and, turn a roller rink out
 You now back up in the club, in the club, tryna mingle Meanwhile, she out, doin' the same thing now
 Nightmares from your dream gal make ya scream out Some people really, some people really
 Some people really are
 Still dreaming
 They are still dreaming Some people really, some people really
 Some people really are How you a man waitin' for the next man to get rich?
 Yo' plan is to stick out yo' hand real quick
 So if he feed ya family and he serve you ****
 Then he need that head you get and he deserve your **** Since you wishin' cash fall from the sky all ya life
 Dwellin' on the past when you was alright
 When you was gettin' cash but wasn't too bright
 Now ya luck down you feel like, bustin' them shells Nobody owe you, can't do nothin' for self
 Want **** to show you, how to come up wit' green
 I scheme since I'm fourteens, what the **** was your dream?
 Rental cars, little broads, sayin' you was seen Wit' little **** wit' a chain you was doin' ya thing
 How high was I? You the thousandth guy
 That came around thinkin' we can see, eye to eye
 We on a different echelon, coulda got bread together
 Now you gets deaded on Some people really, some people really
 Some people really are
 Still dreaming
 They are still dreaming Some people really, some people really
 Some people really are She had several cars, she had credit cards, a castle
 Large master bathroom, gettin' a pedicure
 Belaney by the glassful, said she been meanin' to ask who
 Would need a cash rule, who could blast tools And I'm eatin' cashews, knew she was bad news
 But we mad cool, nothin' sexual 'cause I knew her since high school
 Grew up wit' my dudes, like one of my crews
 She worked for Fox News One of her man's that she lent her drop to
 Won't come back wit' it so she want him clapped in it
 Says it's important that it looks like an accident
 She was snortin' and her eyes had bags in it Sheets was recordin' had a wire, askin' ****
 Four days before I came by she got bagged wit' bricks
 Crossed the line from her world of news castin'
 To a world of entrapment, a good girl gone bad, still dreamin' Some people really, some people really
 Some people really are
 Still dreaming
 They are still dreaming They are still dreaming
 They are still dreaming
 They are still dreaming
 They are still dreaming
