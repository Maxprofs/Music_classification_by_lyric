                        Baby, no matter what I'm doin'
 You know I'd rather be home with you
 And honey, doin' all the things wit'cha
 All the things that you like to do Like washin' your hair an' paintin' your nails
 All the things that your ex-man wouldn't do
 Baby, no I can't wait
 Can't wait to get home to you That's why baby everything I do
 You know, I do it for you
 Everything I say, everything I say is true
 We, we been together so long
 All the crazy things that we been through Baby, you know everything I do
 I do them for you
 You don't hear me though
 I said, "Everything I do, I do them for you" Now baby, you know how it gets so difficult
 To get out of bed with you
 To go to my nine to five
 It's the only place I feel alive wit'cha And to know, to know that you're somewhere waitin' for me
 I know that you're more than enough for me
 I can't wait baby 'cause I know what you got for me That's why baby, everything I do, I do it for you
 And baby, every, every, everything I say
 Every thing I say is true
 We, we been together so long
 All the crazy things that we been through Baby, that's why, everything I do, I do them for you
 Baby, that's why, everything I do, I do them for you What kind of fool would I be
 If I didn't give my all to you and tell me
 Where, where would I be if I couldn't lay next to you
 But if I know that you're down for me Then I know everything is alright
 And by the time I get home to you
 I'm gonna lay a blockbuster on you tonight, tonight Baby, everything I do, I do it for you
 Every thing I say, everything I say is true
 We been together so long
 The crazy things that we been through Baby, you know, everything I do, I do them for you
 Look here, everything I do, I do them for you
 One more time, everything I do, I do them for Just wait a minute
 I said, "Just wait a minute"
 Just wait till I, till I get a hold to it
 I'm a lay, I'm a lay if I do it
