The Wedding Song (There Is Love)
- Captain & Tennille

He's now to be among
you at the calling of your hearts
Rest assured this troubadour
is acting on his part
The union of your spirits here
has caused him to remain
For whenever two or more of you
are gathered in his name
There is love, there is love

Well a man shall leave his mother,
and a woman leave her home
And they shall travel on their way,
the two shall be as one
As it was in the beginning
is now until the end
Woman draws her life from man
and gives it back again
And there's love, there is love

And what's to be the reason
for becoming man and wife
Is it love that brings you here
or love that gives you life
For if loving is the answer
then who's the giving for
Do you believe in something
that you've never seen before
Oh there's love, there is love

And what's to be the reason
for becoming man and wife
Is it love that brings you here
or love that gives you life
For if loving is the answer
then who's the giving for
Do you believe in something
that you've never seen before
Oh there's love, there is love
