                        It's late and I'm awake
 Staring at the wall
 Open up my window
 Head floats out the door

 No one else around
 And a shimmer takes my eye
 I lift my head
 Blinded by the sky

 Feel my way in front
 Following the sound
 It moves away so fast
 Falling to the ground

 I know there's more to come
 Jump back to my feet
 Now I only see ahead of me
 Chasing down the street (down the street, down the street)

 Gave my love to a shooting star
 But she moves so fast
 That I can't keep up
 I'm chasing

 I'm in love with a shooting star
 But she moves so fast
 When she falls then
 I'll be waiting

 Gave my love to a shooting star
 But she moves so fast
 That I can't keep up
 I'm chasing

 I'm in love with a shooting star
 But she moves so fast
 When she falls then
 I'll be waiting
                        
                    |
