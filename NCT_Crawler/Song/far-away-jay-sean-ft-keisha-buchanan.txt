                        Jay sean: Your laugh,
 Those eyes,
 your smile,
 your innocence, means everything to me,
 But you dont know, baby Keisha: The way you, hold me,
 even when you're with your friends,
 you want me,
 means everything, to me, but you
 dont know... Bridge: We dont even talk no more,
 we dont even hold hands like we did before,
 we dont even knowthe reason why it came to be,
 that even though you're with me... Chorus: You feel so far away,
 Feel so far away,
 feel so far away-ay-ay-ay
 feel so far away,
 feel so far away Keisha: i kiss you, without seeing,
 thoughts of ecstasy ,
 But some how your lips feel so cold, baby, Jay sean: we're perfect, arent we?
 in their eyes, only,
 but you and i, both know
 the spark has gone... Bridge: we dont even talk no more,
 we dont even make love like we did before,
 we dont even know the reason why it came to be,
 that even though you're with me... Chorus: you feel so far away (baby girl i need you here,
 baby girl, i need you)
 feel so far away,
 feel so far away,
 feel so far away... feel so far away (girl i need you)
 feel so far away, Keisha: lets maybe take this like
 so we can see,(yeah)
 how beautiful this love can be (so beautiful) jay sean:
 And i know we cant erase what we both feel,
 so lets fall back into what we had... Chorus: that love just feels so far away,
 feels so far away,
 feel so far away (come a little bit, oh, come a little bit, oh)
 feels so far away,
 feels so far away... ohhoh...
