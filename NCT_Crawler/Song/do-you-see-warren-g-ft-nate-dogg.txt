                        The Blues has always been totally American
 As American as apple pie, as American as the Blues
 As American as apple pie, the question is why?
 Why should the Blues be so at home here
 Well, America provided the atmosphere You don't see what I see
 Every day as Warren G
 I take a look over my shoulder, as I get older
 Gettin' tired of motha***as sayin', "Warren I told ya"
 You don't hear what I hear
 But it's so hard to live through these years
 With these funny-bunny niggaz, ain't *** changin'
 Got my mama wonderin' if I'm gang-bangin' But I don't pay attention to these father figures
 I just handle mine and I'm rollin' with my niggaz
 Off to the V.I.P., you see, Snoop Dogg and Warren G
 Unbelievable how time just flies
 Right before your eyes, but you don't recognize
 Now who's the real victim, can you answer that?
 The nigga that's jackin', or the fool gettin' jacked, yeah You don't see what I see
 Every day as Warren G
 You don't hear what I hear
 But it's so hard to live through these years You don't see what I see
 Every day as Warren G
 You don't hear what I hear
 But it's so hard to live through these years Another sunny day, another bright blue sky
 Another day, another mutha***a die
 These are the things I went through when I was growin' up
 There's only one hood and niggas *** be throwin' up
 And I knew it, there really ain't nothin' to it
 Thinkin' every fool's gotta go through it
 Now let's go back, how far? Back in time
 Draggin' to these hookas tryin' to mack for mine I remember when we all used to stop at the spot
 Back then my nigga-name was Snoop Rock
 It was all so clear
 Eighty-seven, eighty-eight, then eighty-nine's the year
 You say, "Everywhere we roll, you can say we roll thick"
 Way back then two one three was the click
 Somethin' to stay paid I was just a young hog
 Warren G, Snoop Rock and Nate Dogg You don't see what I see
 Every day as Warren G
 You don't hear what I hear
 But it's so hard to live through these years You don't see what I see
 Every day as Warren G
 You don't hear what I hear
 But it's so hard to live through these years You make me wanna holler, get out the game
 Too many mutha***as know my name
 While Snoop Dogg's servin' time up in Wayside
 I puts it down on the street, don't try to take mine
 I had to reassure the homie that he wasn't alone
 We'd talk and him and Nate'd conversate on the phone
 He kept sayin', "Nigga, it won't be long
 Before a little skinny nigga like me'll be home" I said, "Snoop, things done change, it's not the same
 We need to get about the game"
 'Cuz we can get paid in a different way
 Wit you kickin' dope rhymes and I D.J.
 Well as time goes past, slowly we try to make it
 But things are gettin' hectic, I just can't take it
 Should I A, go back to slangin' dope?
 Or should I B, maintain and try to cope? Or should I C, just get crazy and wild?
 But no I chose D, create the G-Child
 It's been on ever since with me and Mista Grimm
 This *** is gettin' so hectic that I can't even trust him now
 What would you do for a Warren G cut?
 Would you act the fool and nut the *** up?
 Back the *** up, act the *** up?
 Niggaz talk *** they get smacked the *** up, straight up You don't see what I see
 Every day as Warren G
 You don't hear what I hear
 But it's so hard to live through these years You don't see what I see
 Every day as Warren G
 You don't hear what I hear
 But it's so hard to live through these years You don't see what I see
 Every day as Warren G
 You don't hear what I hear
 But it's so hard to live through these years You don't see what I see
 Every day as Warren G
