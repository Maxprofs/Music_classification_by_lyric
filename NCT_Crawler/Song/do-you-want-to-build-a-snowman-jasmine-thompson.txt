                        Bài hát : Do You Want To Build A Snowman? - Jasmine Thompson

Do you want to build a snowman?
Come on, let's go and play.
 I never see you anymore, come out the door, it's like you've gone away.
 We use to be best buddies, and now we're not.
 I wish you would tell me why? 
Do you want to build a snowman? It doesn't have to be a snowman.
 Okay, bye!
 Do you want to build a snowman?
 Or ride a bike around the halls? 
I think some company is overdue, i starting talking to the picture on the walls. Hang on there, John.
 It get a little lonely, all this empty room.
 Just watching the ours tick by. (the sound of the clock).
 Elsa, please, i know you're in there, people are asking where you've been? Be say of courage and i'm trying to.
 (Sorry, i can't hear this sentence.) just let me in.
 We only have each other, just you and me, what are we gonna do?
 Do you want to build a snowman? (crying).
