                        Bài hát: Be My Forever - Christina Perri, Ed Sheeran

We're on top of the world,
We're on top of the world
Now darling so don't let go.
Can I call you mine?
So can I call you mine now darling
For a whole lifetime?
My heart finally trusts my mind.
And I know somehow it's right.

And oh, we've got time
Yeah,
So darling just say you'll stay right by my side.
And oh we've got love,
Yeah,
So darling just swear you'll stand right by my side.

We're on top of the world,
We're on top of the world
Now darling so don't let go.
I've got something to say,
You're perfect in every way,
I'm gonna shout it out.
I wanna tell you now.
'Cause I know somehow it's right.

And oh, we've got time
Yeah,
So darling just say you'll stay right by my side.
And oh, we've got love
Yeah,
Darling just swear you'll stand right by my side.

Be my forever,
Be my forever,
Be my forever.
Be my forever,
Be my forever,
Be my forever.

You're my bright blue sky.
You're the sun in my eyes.
Oh, baby you're my life.
You're the reason why.

We're on top of the world,
We're on top of the world
Now darling so don't let go.
(1,2,3,4)
And oh, we've got time
Yeah,
We've got love
So darling just say you'll stay right by my side.
And oh, and we've got love
Yeah,
So darling just swear you'll stand right by my side.

Be my forever,
Be my forever,
Be my forever.
Be my forever,
Be my forever,
Be my forever.

Will you love me forever?
I'll love you forever.
Be my forever.
Be my forever,
Be my forever,
Be my forever.
