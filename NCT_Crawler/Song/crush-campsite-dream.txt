                        Bài hát: Crush - Campsite Dream

See you blowin' me a kiss
It doesn't take a scientist
To understand what's goin' on baby
If you see something in my eye

Let's not over analyze
Don't go too deep with it baby
So let it be
What it'll be

Don't make a fuss and go crazy over you and me
Here's what I'll do
I'll play the wuss, not like we have a date with destiny
It's just
A little crush

Not like I faint, every time we touch
It's just some little thing
Not like every thing I do
Depends on you
...
It's raisin' my adrenalin'
You're banging on a heart of tin
Please don't make too much of it baby
Say "that were for ever more"
That's not what I'm lookin' for
All I can commit to is maybe
So let it be
What it'll be

Don't make a fuss and go crazy over you and me
Here's what I'll do
I'll play the wuss, not like we have a date with destiny
It's jus

A little crush
Not like I faint, every time we touch
It's just some little thing
Not like every thing I do

Depends on you
...
Vanilla skies
White picket fences in your eyes
A vision of you and me

It's just
A little crush
Not like I faint, every time we touch
It's just some little thing
Not like every thing I do
Depends on you
It's just
A little crush
...
