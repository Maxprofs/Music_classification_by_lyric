                        There is an empty space in the chair tonight 
Cause he don't feel right 
There are stormclouds brewing at the back of his mind 
As he steps outside 

He will be twenty in a week but he's old for his years 
He's had many of those to confront his own fears 
But his father's not the man he'd like to grow up to be 
And his mother isn't growing old gracefully 

He says times like these I don't want to be a superstar 
Cause reality tv killed them all in america 
Oh the sun always shines in a magazine 
Tonight can we be free to be who we really are 

There is an empty space between the lines tonight 
[| From: http://www.***/read/j/james-blunt-lyrics/superstar-lyrics.html |]
And it burns so bright 
And the angry silence that he throws on the floor 
Says he don't care anymore 

He had money for the truth 
But love's a lot more 
And the answer's is not the one he was looking for 
His father's not the man he'd like to grow up to be 
And his mother is his mother reluctantly 

He says times like these I don't want to be a superstar 
Cause reality tv killed them all in america 
Oh the sun always shines in a magazine 
Tonight can we be free to be who we really are
