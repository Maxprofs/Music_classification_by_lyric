                        You're just too good to be true
 I can't take my eyes off you
 You'd be like heaven to touch
 I wanna hold You so much
 At long last love has arrived
 And I thank God I'm alive
 You're just too good to be true
 Can't take my eyes off You

 Pardon the way that I stare
 There's nothing else to compare
 The sight of You leaves me weak
 There are no words left to speak
 But if you feel like I feel
 Please let me know that is real
 You're just too good to be true
 I can't take my eyes off You

 I love You baby
 And if it's quite all right
 I need You baby
 To warm a lonely night
 I love You baby
 Trust in me when I say

 Oh pretty baby
 Don't bring me down I pray
 Oh pretty baby
 Now that I've found You stay
 And let me love You, baby
 Let me love You

 You're just too good to be true
 I can't take my eyes off you
 You'd be like heaven to touch
 I wanna hold You so much
 At long last love has arrived
 And I thank God I'm alive
 You're just too good to be true
 Can't take my eyes off You

 I love You baby
 And if it's quite all right
 I need You baby
 To warm a lonely night
 I love You baby
 Trust in me when I say

 Oh pretty baby
 Don't bring me down I pray
 Oh pretty baby
 Now that I've found You stay
 And let me love You, baby
 Let me love You
