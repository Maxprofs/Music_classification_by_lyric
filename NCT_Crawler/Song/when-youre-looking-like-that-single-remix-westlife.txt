                        Bài hát: When You're Looking Like That (Single Remix) - Westlife

She's a five foot ten in catsuit and bambi eyes
Everybody's who's staring wouldn't believe that this girl was mine
I should have know I was wrong
When I left her for a life in pity
But they say you never miss the water until it's gone

Guess I failed to love you
And you're taking it out tonight

[Chorus:]
How am I supposed to leave you now
When you're looking like that?
I can't believe what I just gave away
Now I can't take it back
I don't wanna get lost
I don't wanna live my life without you
How am I supposed to leave you now
When you're looking like that?

She's all dressed up for glamour and rock and roll
Wanna squeeze her real tight get out of this place
If only I could take control

But she is out of my reach forever
And just a week ago she lied next to me
It's so ironic how I had to lose just
To see that I failed to love you
And you're taking it out tonight

[Chorus]
I don't wanna forget you
I don't even wanna try
How am I supposed to walk on by when you're looking like that?
                        
                    |
