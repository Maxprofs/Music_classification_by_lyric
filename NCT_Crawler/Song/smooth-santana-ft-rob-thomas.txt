                        Bài hát: Smooth - Santana, Rob Thomas

Man it's a hot one
Like seven inches from the midday sun
Well I hear you whisper and the words melt everyone
But you stay so cold
My mu equita
My Spanish Harlem Mona Lisa
You're my reason for reason
The step in my groove, yeah

Bridge
And if you said this life ain't good enough
I would give my world to lift you up
I could change my life to better suit your mood
'Cause you're so smooth

Chorus
And it's just like the ocean under the moon
Well that's the same as the emotion that I get from you
You got the kind of lovin' that can be so smooth, yeah
Gimme your heart make it real
Or else forget about it

Well I'll tell you one thing
If you would leave it'd be a crying shame
In every breath and every word I hear your name calling me out
Well out from the barrio you hear my rhythm on your radio
You feel the turning of the world so soft and slow
Turning you round and round

Bridge

Chorus x 2

Or else forget about it
Or else forget about it
Oh, let's don't forget about it
(Gimme me your heart, make it real, or else forget about it)
Oh, let's don't forget about it
Let's don't forget about it, yeah
Oh, no, no
Let's don't forget about it (repeat)
                        
                    |
