                        Bài hát: Millenario (Mahouka Koukou No Rettousei Ending) - Elisa

A gentle wind... blooming buds...
As this city is covered in flowers.
As time passes, beauty fades away,
Just like a dream.
Will even your warmth,
Disappear in the same way?
Shape of my love,
Even if there's an end, let's sing this song without fear.
Eternal Song,
I don't need any pretense; just hold me and feel me.
10 years from now... 100 years from now... 1,000 years from now... let's sing of love.
On this road I walked when I was young,
I'm now alone at twilight.
Back then, you were by my side, no matter what;
That past is always there, smiling back at me.
I can see your back far off in the distance...
Please don't leave me behind.
You're my everything,
Even if we part ways, I'll raise my head and persevere.
Fate of my life,
I don't need words, 'cause our hearts are connected.
Take hold of all the happiness... the sadness... and move forward.
Shape of my love,
Even if there's an end, let's keep singing this song without fear.
Eternal Song,
I don't need any pretense; just hold me and feel me.
Shape of my love,
Even if there's an end, let's sing this song without fear.
Eternal Song,
I don't need any pretense; just hold me and feel me.
10 years from now... 100 years from now... 1,000 years from now... let's sing of love.
