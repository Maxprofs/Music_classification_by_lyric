                        Bài hát: Sayoko (Jazz Arrange) - Ashe

There’s nothing left to take, but I still try to reach.
Try to swallow it all down, yet I can’t seem to breathe.
Just a single pill of mine, nothing else would suffice
I take it in, now i’m alive.

My phone is set on lock and I don’t really care.
There’s a tangle and a knot that I cannot repair.
I’m a tragedy, I’m ugly, I’m trying to hide,
I say “Hello” then wave “Goodbye”.

See me fall down,
Let me die here,
Slowly.

Nothing goes right.
Not a trace
Of honesty.

I’m to blame
So I’ll remain.

‘Black’, ‘White’, ‘Day’, ‘Night’
It’s all the same.

See it run down,
Cut away,
No worries.

Say no more,
I can surely say that I’ve “had enough”
I still refuse to believe.

Everyday would be the same,
Nothing more;
Little change.

If I cared, it would mean nothing,
It’s all such a pain.

Friendly bonds are so unneeded,
I don’t give a damn

A busy life,
is what I am.

Could it be, that ‘family’ was a way of escape?
Didn’t know if it was right, so I threw it away

Couldn’t take it anymore,
I had taken enough.
So then I hid my need for ‘love’.

Lay me right down, Let me sleep,
I’m restless.

Cover my eyes, when I’m up
I’ll finally,

Fade away.
Here. Today.

Give me a reason,
Then I’ll stay.

If I could fly,
If for only a moment.

There wouldn’t be, such a need for casualty.
I’m alone,
And that is how it’ll be.

Why does everything I do cause tragedy?
Why does everyone I know keep leaving me here?
Why do I feel so empty inside?
I only want to die...

See me fall down,
Let me die here,
Slowly.

Nothing goes right.
Not a trace
Of honesty.

I’m to blame,
So I’ll remain.

‘Black’, ‘White’, ‘Day’, ‘Night’
It’s all the same.

See it run down,
Cut away,
No worries.

Say no more,
I can surely say that “I’ve had enough”.

I can’t remember...

That very day,
That very day,
Changed me.

Happiness died,
Like a light,
I carried.

I’ll sleep tonight,
And hope to finally leave..

A world which I don’t believe..

A life which I don’t need..

Now, I’ll finally be free...
                        
                    |
