                        Bài hát: Wait For You 
Ca sĩ: Westlife

I never felt nothing in the world 
Like this before 
Now I’m missing you and 
I’m wishing you would come back 
Through my door
Why did you have to go
You could have let me know 
So now I’m all alone
Girl you could have stayed but you chance 
With you not around it’s a little bit more than 
I can stand And all my tesrs 
They keep running down my face
Why did you turn away
So why does your pride make you 
Run and hide 
Are you that afraid of me
But I know it’s a lie what you keep inside 
This is not how you want it to be 
So baby I will wait for you 
Cause I don’t know what else I can do
Don’t tell me I ran out of time 
If it takes the rest of my life
Baby I will wait for you 
If you think I find it just ain’t true 
I really need you in my life 
No matter what I have to do 
I’ll wait for you
Been a long time since you called me
How could you forget about me
You gotta be feeling crazy 
How can you walk away
When every thing stays the same 
I just can’t do it baby
What will it take to make you come back
Girl I told you what is it and 
It just ain’t like that 
Why can’t you look at me
You’re still in love with me 
Don’t leave me crying
Baby why can’t we just start 
All over again
Get it back to me a chace I can love you right
But you’er telling me it won’t be enough
So baby I will wait for you 
Cause I don’t know what else I can do
Don’t tell me I ran out of time 
If it takes the rest of my life
Baby I will wait for you 
If you think I find it just ain’t true 
I really need you in my life 
No matter what I have to do 
I’ll wait for you
So why does your pride make you 
Run and hide 
Are you that afraid of me
But I know it’s a lie what you keep inside 
This is not how you want it to be
Baby I will wait for you
Baby I will wait for you
If it’s the last ting I do
So baby I will wait for you 
Cause I don’t know what else I can do
Don’t tell me I ran out of time 
If it takes the rest of my life
Baby I will wait for you 
If you think I find it just ain’t true 
I really need you in my life 
No matter what I have to do 
I’ll wait for you
I’ll be waiting
