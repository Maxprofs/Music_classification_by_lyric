                        Bài hát: I Knew I Loved You - Savage Garden

Maybe it's intuition 
But some things you just don't question 
Like in your eyes 
I see my future in an instant 
And there it goes 
I think I've found my best friend 
I know that it might sound more than a little crazy 
But I believe 

[Chorus] 
I knew I loved you before I met you 
I think I dreamed you into life 
I knew I loved you before I met you 
I have been waiting all my life 

There's just no rhyme or reason 
Only this sense of completion 
And in your eyes 
I see the missing pieces 
I'm searching for 
I think I've found my way home 

I know that it might sound more than a little crazy 
But I believe 

[Chorus] 

A thousand angels dance around you 
I am complete now that I've found you
