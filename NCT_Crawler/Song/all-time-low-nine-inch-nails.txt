                        Go, I've heard all I need to know
 Your voice in *** echo stereo
 Well this particular scenario
 Looks like another all time low Why did you go and let them in?
 See, this is where the fun begins
 You barely even pierced the skin
 Just wait till you see what is coming Get down on the floor
 Shut the *** door
 We've done this all before
 We're coming back for more So give me just a little, baby
 Just something to get by
 It's gonna last forever, baby
 Forget the other side Then we will live forever, baby
 And stretch across the sky
 I'll follow right behind you, baby
 We're never gonna die Hey!
 Everything is not okay
 We lost too much along the way
 The passengers are out today
 It looks as though they're here to stay This paranoia turns to fear
 There's two of us whispering in your ear
 Pretending but I know you hear
 Just how we *** end up here So give me just a little, baby
 Just something to get by
 It's gonna last forever, baby
 Forget the other side Then we will live forever, baby
 And stretch across the sky
 I'll follow right behind you, baby
 We're never gonna die We're never gonna die
 How did we get so high? Stretch across the sky
