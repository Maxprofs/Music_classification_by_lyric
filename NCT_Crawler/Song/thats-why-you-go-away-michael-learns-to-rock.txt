                        Baby won't you tell me why
There is sadness in your eyes
I don't wanna say goodbye to you
Love is one big illusion, I should try to forget
But there is something left in my head.

You are the one who set it up
Now you are the one to make it stop
I'm the one who's feeling lost right now
Now you want me to forget every little thing you said
But there is something left in my head

(***) I won't forget the way you're kissing
The feeling is so strong we're lasting for so long
But I am not the man your heart is missing
That is why you go away I know..

You're never satisfied no matter how I tried
Now you wanna say goodbye to me
Love is one big inlusion I should try to forget
But there is something left in my head.

Sitting here alone in the midle of nowhere
Don't know which way to go
There ain't so much to say now between us
There ain't so much for you
There ain't so much to me.
