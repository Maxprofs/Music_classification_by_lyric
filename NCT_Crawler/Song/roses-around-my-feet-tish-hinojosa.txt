                        Bài hát: Roses Around My Feet - Tish Hinojosa

You've known the distance
From sea to field of green
I've traded mountains for a dream

Some hearts lay broken
By love's unanswered prayers
Words fly like roses
Through the air

Roses around my feet are telling me somethin'
Roses around my feet
I used to feel nothin'

No grieving for me
These thorns that make us bleed
No lies just reasons to believe

Roses around my feet
Are telling me somethin'
Roses around my feet 
I used to feel nothin'

Spanish:
Canta me cancion de amores
(sing me songs of love)
No me estes hechando flores
(don't throw flowers to me)
Quiero solamente la verdad
(I want only the truth)
                        
                    |
