(Verse)
You're feeling nervous, having your doubts
Don't be embarrassed if you don't fit in the crowd
Keep standing tall and hold your ground
Show a?em it's not okay to let them kick you down

(Pre-Chorus)
Oh oh oh oh
Don't let em ruin your touch
It's now or never, never
Oh oh oh oh
Just let em know it's your life
So do it, use it, frown and own it
Ahuh, that's right

(Chorus part 1)
Yea, you'd better give it everything you got
Just show em you're a sexy lady
Yea, you'd better work it til it's burning hot
Just show em you're a sexy lady

(Chorus part 2)
Time is now baby
Look around baby
Just be proud, you're a sexy lady
Work it on baby, play it loud baby
Just be proud, you're my sexy lady

(Verse)
So admit ita¦ it's feeling good
You're hips are rolling and you love it like you should
Work up a sway, let's enjoy the ride
Good girl, go get it where your comfort is tonight

(Pre-Chorus)
Oh oh oh oh
Don't let em ruin your touch
It's now or never, never
Oh oh oh oh
Just let em know it's your life
So do it, use it, frown and own it
Ahuh, that's right

(Chorus part 1)
Yea, you'd better give it everything you got
Just show em you're a sexy lady
Yea, you'd better work it til it's burning hot
Just show em you're a sexy lady

(Chorus part 2)
Time is now baby
Look around baby
Just be proud, you're a sexy lady
Work it on baby, play it loud baby
Just be proud, you're my sexy lady

(Bridge)
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh

(Chorus part 1)
Yea, you'd better give it everything you got
Just show em you're a sexy lady
Yea, you'd better work it til it's burning hot
Just show em you're a sexy lady

(Chorus part 2)
Time is now baby
Look around baby
Just be proud, you're a sexy lady
Work it on baby, play it loud baby
Just be proud, you're my sexy lady

You're sexy!
