                        Bài hát: Put Me Back Together - Cheat Codes, Kiiara

[Verse 1]
I never met nobody
Who sees the stars the way you do
Nobody that can love me
When I'm stumbling 'round the room
You put your hands on my body
And you give me that room
And I know that you got me
When I'm falling into you

[Chorus]
You take me high, I'm dropping low
And you show me places I never know
Even when we just running 'round town getting stoned
Boy, you put me back together again
A Coca-Cola Hennessey
Everybody says you're no good for me
But you're my *** up remedy
Boy, you put me back together again

[Post-Chorus]
Put me back together again

[Verse 2]
When you're laying with me on the car hood
Sharing such a sweet dream
You make me feel so classy
Like I'm an LA queen
You don't care that I'm broken
You don't care that I'm me
You just say that I'm caught in
Like a [?] of this piece

[Chorus]
You take me high, I'm dropping low
And you show me places I never know
Even when we just running 'round town getting stoned
Boy, you put me back together again
A Coca-Cola Hennessey
Everybody says you're no good for me
But you're my *** up remedy
Boy, you put me back together again

[Post-Chorus]
Put me back together

[Outro]
You take me high, I'm dropping low
And you show me places I never know
Even when we just running 'round town getting stoned
Boy, you put me back together again
A Coca-Cola Hennessey
Everybody says you're no good for me
But you're my *** up remedy
Boy, you put me back together again
Boy, you put me back together again
Boy, you put me back together again
                        
                    |
