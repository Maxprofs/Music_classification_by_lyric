                        Ladies and gentlemen, you already know what it is
 Okay, yeah, aw ***
 I'm cuttin' a rug in this mother***er, I'm tryin' to anyways
 Got two hard lookin' mother***ers, c'mon I was tryin' to enjoy my night but you done came here
 Turned around the vibe I had before I came here
 I done turned into a rude dude, (man) why you had to *** up the night?
 Now we got inna fight, I'ma knock out ya lights You ain't doin' nothing but runnin' ya yap yap
 You got to go to the trunk homeboy, while I am strapped strapped
 I done turned into a rude dude man, why you had to *** up the night?
 Now we got inna fight, I'ma knock out ya lights Dope little lady tryin' to hold you back you better listen to her
 She better not talk that *** I'ma have to put somethin' straight through her
 I done turned into a rude dude man, now why you had to *** up the night?
 Now we got to fight, I'ma knock out ya lights C'mon ***, you think you cool, you think I'm not, you think you tough
 ***, you think you hard, you think I'm soft, you think you rough
 ***, you talkin' ***, betta close your lips, you need to hush
 Before the end of the night, I'm gonna have to take your ass to church ***, you think you cool, you think I'm not, you think you tough
 ***, you think you hard, you think I'm soft, you think you rough
 ***, you talkin' ***, betta close your lips, you need to hush
 Before the end of the night I'm gonna have to take your ass to church It's a Sunday at the park I'm chillin' trying to get ma swerve on
 Some little lame trying to run that game trying to get his serve on
 I then turn into a rude dude man, why you gotta *** up the park
 I'ma put you in the dark, clap on clap off You ain't doin' nothing but runnin' your pie hole
 You gon' make me do somethin' that'll get your eye swoll'
 I don't wanna be a rude dude man, why you gotta *** up the park?
 I'ma put you in the dark, clap on clap off If that's your car you need to go ahead and get into it
 Better not talk that *** you gonna make me put something through it
 I done turned into a rude dude man, why you gotta *** up the park?
 Gotta put you in the dark, lights on lights off ***, you think you cool, you think I'm not, you think you tough
 ***, you think you hard, you think I'm soft, you think you rough
 ***, you talkin' ***, betta close your lips, you need to hush
 Before the end of the night, I'm gonna have to take your ass to church ***, you think you cool, you think I'm not, you think you tough
 ***, you think you hard, you think I'm soft, you think you rough
 ***, you talkin' ***, betta close your lips, you need to hush
 Before the end of the night I'm gonna have to take your ass to church Those niggas think they hard, so why they think I'm not?
 Until I pull they card and I show them what I got kinda like
 I'm like those niggas think they hard, so why they think I'm not
 Until I pull they card and I show them what I got kinda like (mumbles: 'you don't wanna play around here') Those bitches think they hard, so why they think I'm not?
 Until I pull they card and I show them what I got kinda like
 Those bitches think they hard, so why they think I'm not?
 Until I pull they card and I show them what I got kinda like (mumbles: 'you don't wanna play around here')
 (laughing) you stupid ***, you think you cool, you think I'm not, you think you tough
 ***, you think you hard, you think I'm soft, you think you rough
 ***, you talkin' ***, betta close your lips, you need to hush
 Before the end of the night, I'm gonna have to take your ass to church ***, you think you cool, you think I'm not, you think you tough
 ***, you think you hard, you think I'm soft, you think you rough
 ***, you talkin' ***, betta close your lips, you need to hush
 Before the end of the night I'm gonna have to take your ass to church
