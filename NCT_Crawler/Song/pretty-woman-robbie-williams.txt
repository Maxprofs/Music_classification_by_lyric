                        Bài hát: Pretty Woman - Robbie Williams

Hey pretty woman I wanna take you out
I know a place we can move our feet downtown
Ease into the rhythm when I hear that sound
My momma told me and I do not back down

Hey pretty woman I love the way you move
Winding down low to that bassline grove
The way you're dancing got me in the mood
Daddy told me it's what grown folks do

Let me tell you now
Hey pretty woman Imma testify
Hey pretty woman make a grown man cry

You can make me beg
Take my last dollar
Oh honey you can take it anywhere you wanna
The way you move your leg
Well it just ain't proper
Why don't you shake what you've been given from your momma

Hey pretty woman come and hold my hand
Dance the charleston to that old swing band
I know that it's getting late but you don't mind
Let's take a taxi and get back to mine

Hey pretty woman, your daddy don't know
Take what you want from me, I can't say no
Just put your hands on my body let me taste your lips
I put my hands on your body baby work those hips

You can make me beg
Take my last dollar
Oh honey you can take it anywhere you wanna
The way you move your leg
Well it just ain't proper
Why don't you shake what you've been given from your momma

Hey pretty woman now now now I'm in love
You are the only one I'm thinking of
Hey pretty woman, if you feel the same
Just say hey there boy bring that beat back again

You can make me beg
Take my last dollar
Oh honey you can take it anywhere you wanna
The way you move your leg
Well it just ain't proper
Why don't you shake what you've been given from your momma

You can make me beg
Take my last dollar
Oh honey you can take it anywhere you wanna
The way you move your leg
Well it just ain't proper
Why don't you shake what you've been given from your momma
