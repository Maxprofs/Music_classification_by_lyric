Blues/Jazz|

                        I used to visit all the very gay places
 Those come-what-may places
 Where one relaxes on the axis of the wheel of life
 To get the feel of life from jazz and cocktails The girls I knew had sad and sullen gray faces
 With distinguish traces that used to be there
 You could see where they'd been washed away
 By too many through the day, twelve O'clock tales Then you came along with your siren song
 To tempt me to madness
 I thought for awhile that your poignant smile
 Was tinged with the sadness of a great love for me
 Ah, yes, I was wrong, again, I was wrong Life is lonely again and only last year
 Everything seemed so sure
 Now life is awful again a trough full of hearts
 Could only be a bore A week in Paris could ease the bite of it
 All I care is to smile in spite of it
 I'll forget you, I will while yet you are still
 Burning inside my brain Romance is mush stifling those who strive
 I'll live a lush life in some small dive
 And there I'll be while I rot with the rest
 Of those whose lives are lonely too Romance is mush stifling those who strive
 I'll live a lush life in some small dive
 And there I'll be while I rot with the rest
 Of those whose lives are lonely too
