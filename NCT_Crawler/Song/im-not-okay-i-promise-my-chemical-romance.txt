                        Well, if you wanted honesty thats all you had to say
I never want to let u down or have you go
It's better off this way
For all the dirty looks
The photographs your boyfriend took
Remember when you broke your foot from jumping out the second floor

I'm not okay
I'm not okay
I'm not okay
You wear me out

What will it take to show you that it's not the life it seems (I'm not okay)
I told you time and time again you sing the words but dunno what it means (I'm not okay)
To be a joke and look
Another line without a hook
I held you close as we both shook for the last time
Take a good hard look

I'm not okay
I'm not okay
I'm not okay
You wear me out

Forget about the dirty looks
The photographs your boyfriend took
You said you read me like a book
But the pages are all torn and frayed now

I'm okay
I'm okay!
I'm okay now (I'm okay now)
But you really need to listen to me
'Cause i'm telling the truth
I mean this
I'm okay! (trust me)

I'm not okay
I'm not okay
Well, I'm not okay
I'm not o- *ing-kay
I'm not okay
I'm not okay (okay)
