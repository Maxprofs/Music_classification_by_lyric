                        Brian, the babe they called Brian
 He grew, grew, grew and grew
 Grew up to be, grew up to be A boy called Brian

 And he grew, grew, grew and grew
 Grew up to be, yes, he grew up to be A teenager called Brian

 Yes, his face became spotty
 And his voice dropped down low
 And things started to grow

 Not a girl named Brian And he started to shave
 And had one off the wrist
 And want to see girls
 And go out and get pissed A man called Brian
 This man called Brian
 The man they called Brian
