Soft heavenly eyes gazed into me
Transcending space and time
And I was rendered still
There were no words for me to find at all
As I stood there beside myself
I could see you and no-one else
When I saw you
When I saw you
I could not breathe
I fell so deep
Oh
When I saw you
When I saw you
I’d never be
I’d never be the same
Only once in a lifetime love rushes in
Changing you with the tide
And dawn’s ribbon of light
Bursts through the dark
Wakening you inside
And I thought it was all untrue
Until there, all at once, I knew
When I saw you
When I saw you
I could not breathe
I fell so deep
Oh
When I saw you
When I saw you
I’d never be
I’d never be the same
With no beginning
And without an end
You are the one for me
And it’s evident
And your eyes told me so yeah
Your eyes let me know
When I saw you
When I saw you
I could not breathe
I fell so deep
Oh
When I saw you
When I saw you
I’d never be
I’d never be the same
