                        You and I must make a pact, we must bring salvation back 
Where there is love, I'll be there 

I'll reach out my hand to you, Ill have faith in all you do 
Just call my name and Ill be there 

I'll be there to comfort you, 
Build my world of dreams around you, I'm so glad that I found you 
I'll be there with a love that's strong 
I'll be your strength, I'll keep holding on 

Let me fill your heart with joy and laughter 
Togetherness, well that's all I'm after 
Whenever you need me, I'll be there 

I'll be there to protect you, with an unselfish love that respects you 
Just call my name and I'll be there 

If you should ever find someone new, I know hed better be good to you 
cause if he doesn't, I'll be there 
Don't you know, baby, yeah yeah 
I'll be there, I'll be there, just call my name, I'll be there 

(just look over your shoulders, honey - oo) 

I'll be there, I'll be there, whenever you need me, I'll be there 
Don't you know, baby, yeah yeah 

I'll be there, I'll be there, just call my name, I'll be there...
