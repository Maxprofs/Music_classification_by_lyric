                        Bài hát: Revolution - Van William, First Aid Kit

Lost my valentine
You could never keep my meaning straight
And I won't wait in line
For you to give me any time of day
I want a revolution

You want a short solution
We never could see eye to eye
You wanted retribution
I came to the same conclusion
It's a story as old as time
I heard you cryin' in the other room

Tried to test the eyes
But I could hear a cracking underneath
There's no compromise
If both of us are aching to be free
I want a revolution
You want a short solution
We never could see eye to eye

You wanted retribution
I came to the same conclusion
It's a story as old as time
I heard you cryin' in the other room
It took a lifetime
For us to see that it's to late
We're a broken stake

And after all of this
We keep ignoring the signs
The waters run dry
I want a revolution
You want a short solution
We never could see eye to eye

You wanted retribution
I came to the same conclusion
It's a story as old as time
I heard you cryin' in the other room
I want a revolution
I want a revolution
                        
                    |
