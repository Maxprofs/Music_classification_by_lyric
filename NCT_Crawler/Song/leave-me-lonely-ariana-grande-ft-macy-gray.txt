                        Bài hát: Leave Me Lonely - Ariana Grande, Macy Gray

[Intro - Macy Gray:]
Dangerous love
You're no good for me, darling
Yeah, you turn me away
Like I'm begging for a dollar
Danger, oh, how you hold me
I get a chill inside
And nothing frightens me, baby
Oh

[Verse 1 - Ariana Grande:]
Is it love when so easily said goodbye?
Is it love when we've given up before we tried?
Is it love when you stole my peace of mind?
Is it love when you cry, cry and cry?

[Pre-Chorus - Ariana Grande:]
So when you walk out that door
Don't you come back no more
My heart has had enough of the give and take
And as much as I want you to stay

[Chorus]
You're a dangerous love
Baby, you're no good for me, darling
'Cause if you're gonna love me and leave me hanging here
Then I'd rather you leave me lonely
Even though it hurts
You're a dangerous love

[Bridge - Macy Gray:]
Dangerous love
You're no good for me, darling
Yeah, you turn me away
Like I'm begging for a dollar
Danger, oh, how you hold me
I get a chill inside
And nothing frightens me, baby
Oh

[Pre-Chorus - Ariana Grande:]
When you walk out that door
Don't you come back no more
My heart has had enough of the give and take
And as much as I want you to stay

[Chorus - Ariana Grande:]
You're a dangerous love
Baby, you're no good for me, darling
'Cause if you're gonna love me and leave me hanging here
Then I'd rather you leave me, leave me lonely
Even though it hurts
Mm
You're a dangerous love
                        
                    |
