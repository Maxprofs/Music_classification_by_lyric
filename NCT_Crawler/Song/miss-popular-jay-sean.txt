                        Its like ooh, ooh I wouldnt mind waiting on somebody like you
 I know you heard it all before
 But baby its true
 I tried to look the other way when I saw you walk by
 So you wouldnt think I was one of those guys Who be sayin I got money and I could buy
 Buy you everything you ever wanted
 But thats all lies
 Cause baby on the real if I had one of you
 I could give you all the things that I love its true
 Baby thats why Im gonna try
 Im gonna try with you Even if I gotta stand out in a line
 Stand out in a line Ill stand in a line
 While a million guys all fight to catch your eye
 Fight to catch your eye Ill fight to catch your eye
 Imma make you mine I would find a way
 When everybodys gone Ill be here to stay
 Everybody wants miss popular
 But I mean what I say baby
 Miss popular ooh ooh ooh
 Miss popular ooh ooh ooh I wouldnt mind waiting on something so soft
 Dont wanna use imagination Id rather take it off
 Clothes off
 When you get it you gon understand
 You aint gonna need no other man
 Ive been waiting on this moment for so long yeah They be saying I got money and I could buy
 Buy you everything you ever wanted
 But thats all lies
 Cuz baby on the real if I had one of you
 I could give you all the things that I love its true
 And baby thats why Im gonna try
 Im gonna try with you my girl Even if I gotta stand out in a line
 Stand out in a line Ill stand in a line
 While a million guys all fight to catch your eye
 Fight to catch your eye Ill fight to catch your eye
 Imma make you mine I would find a way
 When everybodys gone Ill be here to stay
 Everybody wants miss popular
 But I mean what I say baby
 Miss popular ooh ooh ooh
 You know you my you know you my
 Miss popular ooh ooh ooh Everybody looks, everybody tries
 Not everybody takes their time
 Imma be the one to go the whole nine
 Watch Imma make you mine
 And I know I aint got a thing to prove
 So baby when I tell you that Im your guy

 Baby I... Even if I gotta stand out in a line
 Stand out in a line Ill stand in a line
 While a million guys all fight to catch your eye
 Fight to catch your eye Ill fight to catch your eye
 Imma make you mine I would find a way
 When everybodys gone Ill be here to stay
 Everybody wants miss popular
