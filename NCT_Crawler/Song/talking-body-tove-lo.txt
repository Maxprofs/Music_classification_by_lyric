                        Bài hát: Talking Body - Tove Lo

Bed, stay in bed
The feeling of your skin locked in my head
Smoke, smoke me broke
I don't care I'm down for what you want

[Pre-Chorus:]
Day drunk into the night, wanna keep you here
Cause you dry my tears
Summer lovin' and fights, how it is for us
And it's all because

[Chorus x2:]
Now if we're talking body
You got a perfect one so put it on me
Swear it won't take you long
If you love me right, we *** for life
On and on and on

Love, give me love
Anything you want I'll give it up
Lips, lips I kiss
Bite me while I taste you're finger tips

[Pre-Chorus]

[Chorus x2]

[Bridge:]
Bodies
Oh baby making bodies we just use for fun
Bodies
Let's use 'em up 'til every little piece is gone

On and on and on (Let's go)
On and on (Let's go)

[Chorus x3]
                        
                    |
