                        Verse 1:
 I can feel when you're happy
 When you're near me, every heart beats
 Making me feel, like it's magic and we have it, when it happens Bridge:
 I wanna scream your name, out to the sky, let it shine with the stars
 Now that you lit the flame don't let it die, just let it burn Chorus:
 Forever and a day, baby, that's what I want when I'm with you
 You'll never go away, baby, no one can do me like you do
 Forever and a day, that's how long I'll be loving you
 You'll never go away, I will search this whole world for you Verse 2:
 How could something, come between us?
 When it's nothing that can mean as much
 And you whisper that you love me
 While were dancing I lose gravity. Bridge:
 I wanna scream your name, out to the sky, let it shine with the stars
 Now that you lit the flame 't let it die, just let it burn
 Nooooo Chorus:
 Forever and a day, baby, 's what I want when 'm with you (when 'm with you)
 I'll never go away, baby, no one can do me like you do (Can do, me like you do)
 Forever and a day, 's how long 'll be loving you
 I'll never go away, I will search this whole world for you Vamp:
 I can search a lifetime and I'd find
 Someone special that I could call mine
 There to have you
 Always want you around me forever,
 Forever and A Day Forever and A Day Chorus:
 Forever and a day, baby, 's what I want when 'm with you
 'll never go away, baby, no one can do me like you do (No one can make me feel)
 Forever and a day, 's how long 'll be loving you
 'll never go away, I will search this whole world for you Vamp:
 I can search a lifetime and I'd find
 Someone special that I could call mine
 There to have you
 Always want you around me forever,
 Forever and A Day
