                        Staring at the moon so blue 
Turning all my thoughts to you 
I was without hope or dream 
Try to dull an inner scream 
But you . . . saw me through . . . 

Walking on a path of air 
See your faces everywhere 
As you melt this heart of stone 
You take my hand to guide me home and now I'm in love 

You took my heart away 
When my whole world was grey 
You gave me everything and a little bit more 
And when it's cold at night 
And you sleep by my side 
You become the meaning of my life . . . 

Living in a world so cold 
You were there to warm my soul 
You came to mend a broken heart 
You gave my life a brand new start 
And now . . . I'm in love 

You took my heart away 
When my whole world was grey 
You gave me everything and a little bit more 
And when it's cold at night 
And you sleep by my side 
You become the meaning of my life . . . 

Holding your hands 
I won't fear tomorrow 
Here where we stand 
We never be alone 

You took my heart away 
When my whole world was grey 
You gave me everything and a little bit more 
And when it's cold at night 
And you sleep by my side 
You become the meaning of my life . . . 
You become the meaning of my life . . . 
You become the meaning 
You become the meaning of my life . . .
