                        I wore the clothes you like 
You said they gave me that look 
I even tried to like the food 
I know you like to cook 
I parted my hair on the left 
I carried your arm on the right 
I slept late in the morning 
And stayed out late at night. 

I can't give anymore of my soul away 
And still look myself in the mirror everyday 
I can't change anymore of what makes me be myself 
And still have enough left not to be somebody else 

I'm not demanding as a man 
Just asking you love me for what I am. 

I tried hard not to say the things you don't like to hear 
And when to you it was apricot I nibbled on your ear 
I open the door up for you, I keep my big mouth shut 
But I've been moving down while you been going up. 

I can't give anymore of my soul away 
And still look myself in the mirror everyday 
I can't change anymore of what makes me be myself 
And still have enough left not to be somebody else 

I'm not demanding as a man 
Just asking you love me for what I am. 

I can't give anymore of my soul away 
And still look myself in the mirror everyday 
I can't change anymore of what makes me be myself 
And still have enough left not to be somebody else 

I'm not demanding as a man 
Just asking you love me for what I am. 
Love me for what I am 
Love me for what I am
