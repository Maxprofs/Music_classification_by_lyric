                        Bài hát:You Are Not Alone (Acoustic) - D-Side

Another day is gone, I'm still all alone
How could this be, when you're not here with me
You never said goodbye, someone tell me why
Did you have to go, and leave my world so cold
Everyday I sit and ask myself
How did love slip away?
Something whispers in my ear and says,

Chours:
That you are not alone
I am here with you
Though you're far away
I am here to stay
You are not alone
I am here with you
Though we're far apart
You're always in my heart
But you are not alone

'Lone, 'lone
Why, 'lone

Just the other night, I thought I heard you cry
Asking me to come, and I hold you in my arms
I can hear your prayers, your burdens I will bear
But first I need your hand, then forever can began
Everyday I sit and ask myself
How did love slip away?
Something whispers in my ear and says

Chorus:
That you are not alone
I am here with you
Though you're far away
I am here to stay
You are not alone
I am here with you
Though we're far apart
You're always in my heart
But you are not alone

Whisper three words and I'll come runnin'
And girl you know that I'll be there, I'll be there

Chours:
You are not alone
For I am here with you
Though you're far away
I am here to stay
For you are not alone
For I am here with you
Though we're far apart
You're always in my heart

For you are not alone (You are not alone)
For I am here with you (I am here with you)
Though you're far away (Though you're far away)
I am here to stay
For you are not alone (You're always in my heartttttttttttt)
For I am here with you
Though we're far apart
You're always in my heart

For you are not alone...(Not alone, oh~)
(Oh~~oh~oh) You are not alone, you are not alone, say it again
(Oh~~oh~oh) You are not alone, you are not alone, not alone, not alone
(Oh~~oh~oh) You just reach out for me, girl . In the morning, in the evening
(Oh~~oh~oh) Not alone, not alone, you and me, not alone
(Oh~~oh~oh) Together, together
(Oh~~oh~oh) Can’t stop being alone....
