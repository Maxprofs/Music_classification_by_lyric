                        Song: All The Way - Celine Dion, Frank Sinatra

When somebody loves you
It's no good unless 
he loves you all the way
All the way
Happy to be near you 
when you need someone to cheer you
All the way

Taller than the tallest tree is
That's how it's got to feel
Deeper than the deep blue sea is
That's how deep it goes if it's real

When somebody needs you
It's no good unless he needs you all the way
Through the good or lean years
And for all the in-between years
Come what way

Who know where the road will lead us?
Only a fool would say
But if you'll let me love you
It's for sure I'm gonna love you
All the way
All the way
                        
                    |
