                        So let\\\'s sing na, na na na na, hey ya
Come on and sing na, na na na na, hey ya

This is our song that\\\'s all that matter cause
We all belong right here together
There\\\'s nothing better than singing along
This is our summer
This is our song

And grab your guitar
Sit by the fire
Cause we all need a song
When we tired
We\\\'ll sit here together and sing it out loud

This is our song that\\\'s all that matter cause
We all belong right here together
There\\\'s nothing better than singing along
This is our summer and this is our song
This is our song, this is our song
This is our song

Come on and sing na, na na na na, hey ya
(repeat)

This is our song that\\\'s all that matters cause
We all belong right here together
There\\\'s nothing better than singing along
This is our summer (Our summer)

This is our song that\\\'s all that matters cause
We all belong right here together
There\\\'s nothing better than singing along
This is our summer
This is our song (This is our song)
This is our song (This is our song)
This is our song
This is our song!
