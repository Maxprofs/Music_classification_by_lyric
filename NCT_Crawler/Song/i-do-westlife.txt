Tell me can’t you feel my heart beat
Tell me as I kneel down at your feet
I knew there would come a time
When these two hearts would entwine
Just put your hand in mine
Forever
For so long I have been an island
When no-one could ever
Reach these shores
And we’ve got a whole lifetime to share
And I’ll always be there,
darling this I swear
So please believe me
For these words I say are true
And don’t deny me
A lifetime loving you
And if you ask will I be true
Do I give my all to you
Then I will say I do
I’m ready to begin this journey
Well I’m with you with every step you take
And I’ll always be there
Darling this I swear
If you ask will I be true
So come on just take my hand, oh come on
Let’s make a stand for our love
But I know this is so hard I believe
So please
