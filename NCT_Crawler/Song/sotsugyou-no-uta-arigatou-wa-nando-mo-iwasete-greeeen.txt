                        Bài hát: Sotsugyou No Uta - Arigatou Wa Nando Mo Iwasete - GReeeeN

Zutto konomama itai keredo sore ja dame da to wakatteru kara
Ima konomama de itai keredo soro soro wakare no toki ga kita

Sabishiku naru ne dakedo ima wa ureshiku naite asu wo omotte

Wasurenai yo mune wo hatte ayunde ikou ka
Kimi to sugoshita toki no you na waku waku sagashite

Sakihokore michibata ni saku hana no you ni
Fumarete mo nando mo egao de saite yare

Hajimari wa ne gikochi nakatta ne ima ja subete ga wakariaeru you de
Nani wo shiteta wake ja nai toki mo furikaereba itoshii'n da ne

Yaritai koto ya kanaetai koto wa
Omoitsukanai kurai takusan atte
Sono dore mo ga kitto bokura wo mattete
Dakara ima wa mata itsuka

"Arigatou" wa kimi no kotoba he
"Sayounara" wa kimi no senaka he
"Ureshii" no wa asu wo omotte
"Samishii" no wa kinou wo omotte

Furikaereba ironna koto norikoe mo shitashi makete mo kita
Sono subete wa kimi ga ita kara wasure enai hibi ni omoeru'n da ne

Ima no boku ni wa wakaranai koto mo
Takusan aru kedo hitotsu wakatta yo
Kyoukasho ni aru kotoba ja nakute
Kimi to no ano hi ga boku no ima

"Arigatou" wa nando mo iwasete
"Sayounara" wa kyou dake iwasete
"Ureshii" no wa ashita wo omotte
"Samishii" no wa kinou wo omotte

Kore kara dokoka ni aru deau beki suteki de sukoshi tsurai koto wa
Kitto sorezore chigau keredo
Kokoro no naka de kimi ga tonari de
Waraiatta hibi wo mune ni saa

"Arigatou" wa kimi no kotoba he
"Sayounara" wa kimi no senaka he
"Ureshii" no wa asu wo omotte
"Samishii" no wa kinou wo omotte

"Arigatou" wa nando mo iwasete
"Sayounara" wa kyou dake iwasete
"Ureshii" no wa kimi wo omotte
"Samishii" no wa kimi wo omotte

RARARA hohoemi nagara sonna uta utatte ima wa sayounara
Kitto namida ga kawaku hima mo nai kurai toki ga
Bokura wo matteru mata aou ne
Saa ikou ka

TRANSLATION

Because I know its no good, so I want to leave home
I want to stay away from this, but soon will be parting ways and its hurts a lot

Now I'm so lonely, thinking of tomorrow makes me happy but at the same time I feel crying

I will never forget to walk my head up and lets continue on
It feels exciting while spending the time with you, let's keep on searching

I feel like a flower blooming on that road side
for how many times you stepped on it, it will continue to bloom

At first I was too awkward but now, I seem to understand it all
I'm looking back at the moments that I don't understand at all my dear

The things that you to do & be granted
you should not think about it 
I'm so sure that it will come true just keep on waiting
so anytime, it will come again

"Thank you" to your words
"Goodbye" to your back
"Happiness" while thinking of tomorrow
"Lonely" while thinking of yesterday

Just keep on looking back to the things so you can overcome the losses you have
Because you stayed to me, I'll keep on remembering those days and never forgotten it

Now, you don't know anything about me
there's a lot of things, but I only found one
The words are not in the textbook
you are my day, that day and even now

"Thank you" let me say it for many times
"Goodbye" for only this day
"Happiness" while thinking of tomorrow
"Lonely" while thinking of yesterday

Somewhere from here, its a little spicy feeling but so nice to cross it
I'm such that's different now
but in my heart, you're always next to me
So come into my heart everyday

"Thank you" to your words
"Goodbye" to your back
"Happiness" while thinking of tomorrow
"Lonely" while thinking of yesterday

"Thank you" let me say it for many times
"Goodbye" for only this day
"Happiness" while thinking of you
"Lonely" while thinking of you

LALALA while singing this song with a smile, now its goodbye
surely our tears wont change in the future but there's no spare time
so let's keep on waiting for this blue
Shall we go now
                        
                    |
