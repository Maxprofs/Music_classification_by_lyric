                        Bài hát: The Way I Are (DJ Ro Bi Full Remix 2016) - Timbaland, Keri Hilson, D.O.E, Sebastian

I ain't got no money 
I ain't got no car to take you on a date 
I can't even buy you flowers 
But together we can be the perfect soul mates 
Talk to me girl 

Baby, it's alright, now you ain't gotta floss for me 
If we go there, you can still touch my love, it's free 
We can work without the perks, just you and me 
Thug it out 'til we get it right 

Baby if you strip, you could get a tip 
'Cause I like you just the way you are 
I'm about to strip and I want it quick 
Can you handle me the way I are? 

I don't need the cheese or the car keys 
Boy I like you just the way you are 
And let me see ya strip, you could get a tip 
'Cause I like 

I ain't got no Visa 
I ain't got no Red American Express 
We can't go nowhere exotic 
It don't matter 'cause I'm the one that loves you best 
Talk to me girl 

Baby, it's alright, now you ain't gotta floss for me 
If we go there, you can still touch my love, it's free 
We can work without the perks, just you and me 
Thug it out 'til we get it right 

Baby if you strip, you could get a tip 
'Cause I like you just the way you are 
I'm about to strip and I want it quick 
Can you handle me the way I are? 

I don't need the cheese or the car keys 
Boy I like you just the way you are 
And let me see ya strip, you could get a tip 
'Cause I like you just the way you are 

Baby girl 
I don't got a huge ol' house 
I rent a room in a house 
Listen baby girl 
I ain't got a motorboat but I can float ya boat 

So listen baby girl 
Once you get a dose of D.O.E. 
You gon' want some mo' 
So listen baby girl 
When I make it I want you back 
Want you back, yeah
