                        Bài hát : Forsaken - Dream Theater

For a while I thought I fell asleep
Lying motionless inside a dream
Then rising suddenly I felt a chilling breath upon me
She softly whispered in my ear

Forsaken
I have come for you tonight
Awaken
Look in my eyes
And take my hand
Give yourself up to me

I waited painfully for night to fall again
Trying to silence the fear within me
Out of an ivory mist I felt a stinging kiss
And saw a crimson stain on her lips

I have to know your name
Where have I seen your face before?
My dear one don't you be afraid

Forsaken
I have come for you tonight
Awaken
Look in my eyes
And take my hand
Give yourself up to me

Take me far away
Close your eyes
And hold your breath
Till the end of the earth

Forsaken
I have come for you tonight
Awaken
Look in my eyes and take my hand

Forsaken
Fly away with me tonight
Awaken
Renew my life
Now you are mine
Give yourself up to me
                        
                    |
