                        Bài hát: Taste The Feeling - Avicii, Conrad Sewell

It feels good, in my heart, in my soul
When you're right here beside me
I don't ever want this day to end

Mmm... We can watch the waves, have a Coke
And you sit here beside me
Take a little long my heart again

So we can feel whatever you feel
Together we will, together at

No one can stop me when I taste the feeling
Nothing could ever bring me down
No one can stop me when I taste the feeling
Nothing could ever bring me down
Could make it easier to sing it

Could make it easier to sing it

Mmm. It feels good as we stand on the shore
and our hearts are jumping
I Grab another Coke and let's dive in
Ohh, my love, there's a song in my soul
When you are around me
You make it easier to sing it
So we can feel whatever you feel
Together we will, together at

No one can stop me when I taste the feeling
Nothing could ever bring me down
No one can stop me when I taste the feeling
Nothing could ever bring me down

With every fading sunset
We see the stars aligned
You make the simple moments last for a lifetime
So, we can feel forever
You and me, together
Make it stream forever
And be real together.
No one can stop me when I taste the feeling
Nothing could ever bring me down
No one can stop me when I taste the feeling
Nothing could ever bring me down
Could make it easier to sing yeah
Could make it easier to sing yeah
