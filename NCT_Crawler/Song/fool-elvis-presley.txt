                        Gather
 Around me, buddy
 Raise your glasses high
 And drink to a fool
 A crazy fool
 Who told his baby goodbye
 Too late, he found he loved her
 So much he wants to die
 So drink to a fool, you crazy fool
 Who told his baby goodbye
 He needs her, he needs her so
 He wonders why he let her go She's found, she's found, she's found
 A new love buddy, he's a lucky guy, oh
 So drink to a fool, a crazy fool
 Who told his baby goodbye He needs her, he needs her so
 He wonders why he let her go, oh, oh, oh
 She's found, she's found, she's found
 A new love buddy, he's a lucky guy, oh So drink to a fool
 Crazy fool
 Who told his baby goodbye
 Who told his baby goodbye Goodbye, goodbye
 Goodbye, goodbye...
