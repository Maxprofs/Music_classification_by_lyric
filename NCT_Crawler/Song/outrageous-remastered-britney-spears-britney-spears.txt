Capital Lights - Outrage

I'll take the blame for you for taking one
chance away from me at getting over this
And what you were to me, your work is done,
I'm laughing, after all we're getting too old for this and
What a pretty night, what a pretty night,
You finally fit into my shoes,
I'm never dressed for the occasional
Invasion of surprises, I don't get surprised
You think your secret's safe with you,
I'll catch it swinging through the grapevine
It's time I let you go,
And here's looking at you kid
Your last word comes out slower than you thought it would
Its all you ever wanted but
You couldn't see me coming with the lights out,
You're gonna find out
I'll leave you raining on your own parade
Gung ho you let your guard down,
you're nothing but a write-out,
I'll leave you raining on your own parade

I'm taking shame with you for taking 2,
too many years that could have lasted now we'll never get back
But tonight the moon will set the mood,
I'm a train routed off course just to keep on track and
What a petty crime, what a petty crime,
How could you be anything but greedy when its all that you know
Give another try, give another try,
But if you're one for the money than you're too good to show on time
I let you down,
And here's looking at you kid
Now that I found and caught you red- handed I'm the last man standing 'cuz
You couldn't see me coming with the lights out,
You're gonna find out
I'll leave you raining on your own parade
Gung ho, you let your guard down,
you're nothing but a write-out,
I'll leave you raining on your own parade
You couldn't see me coming with the lights out,
You're gonna find out
I'll leave you raining on your own parade
Gung ho, you let your guard down,
you're nothing but a write-out,
I'll leave you raining on your own parade

Take my goodbyes with love and meaningful lyrics
I got you this time, I got you this time
A closing line unannounced and breaking your spirits
A curtain call cry, I got you this time, I got you this time
It's happened all before with you the one to call it short
but girl when I say that it's over than its over for good
We're nothing now but history,
I'll leave you reminiscing in a diary regretting paying dues
You couldn't see me coming with the lights out,
You're gonna find out
I'll leave you raining on your own parade
Gung ho, you let your guard down,
you're nothing but a write-out,
I'll leave you raining on your own parade
You couldn't see me coming with the lights out,
You're gonna find out
I'll leave you raining on your own parade
Gung ho, you let your guard down,
you're nothing but a write-out,
I'll leave you raining on your own parade
You couldn't see me coming with the lights out,
soon your gonna find that I'll take you out,
This is an Outrage!
You couldn't see me coming with the lights out,
You're gonna find out
I'll leave you raining on your own parade
I'll leave you raining on your own parade
I'll leave you raining on your own parade
