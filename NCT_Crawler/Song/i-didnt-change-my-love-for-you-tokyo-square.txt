                        Think about your love
I think about you now
I'm still alone, feeling down somehow
Walk in the rain
It's cold deep in my heart
No one sorrow,
But the pain hearts me right down

Singing love again
I'm feeling blue again
I'll never change after all this year
Sang me you dream
If you feel the same way too
'Cause I need you right now and forever

I never change my love for you
Are you feeling the same way too?
I need you by my side
To hold me every night
I never change my love for you
Are you feeling the same way too?
I giving you so much
But now I never hear from you

Think about your love
I think about you now
I'm still alone, feeling down so much
It's cold deep in my heart
No one sorrow,
But the pain hearts me right down

Singing love again
I'm feeling blue again
I'll never change after all this year
Sang me you dream
If you feel the same way too
'Cause I need you right now and forever

I never change my love for you
Are you feeling the same way too?
I need you by my side
To hold me every night
I never change my love for you
Are you feeling the same way too?
I giving you so much
But now I never hear from you

I never change my love for you
Are you feeling the same way too?
I need you by my side
To hold me every night
I never change my love for you
Are you feeling the same way too?
I giving you so much
But now I never hear from you
                        
                    |
