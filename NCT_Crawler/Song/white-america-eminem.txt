America
hahaha
We love you
How many people are proud to be citizens
of this beautiful country of ours?
The stripes and the stars for the rights of men
who have died for the protect?
The women and men who have broke their necks
for the freedem of speech the United States Government
has sworn to uphold
Yo, I want everyone to listen to the words of this song
Or so we're told...
Verse #1
I never woulda dreamed in a million years id see
so many mutha ***in people who feel like me
Who share the same views
And the same exact beliefs
Its like a ***in army marchin in back of me
So many lives I touched
So much anger aimed at no perticular direction
Just sprays and sprays
Straight through your radio wavs
It plays and plays
Till it stays stuck in your head
For days and days
who woulda thought standin in this mirror
Bleachin my hair wit some Peroxide
Reachin for a T shirt to wear
That I would catipult to the fore-front of rap like this
How can I predict my words
And have an impact like this
I musta struck a chord wit somebody up in the office
Cuz congress keeps tellin me
I aint causin nuttin but problems
And now they sayin im in trouble wit the government
Im lovin it
I shovelled *** all my life
And now im dumpin it on
Chorus
WHITE AMERICA
I could be one of ur kids
WHITE AMERICA
Little erik looks just like this
WHITE AMERICA
Erica loves my ***
I go to TRL
Look how many hugs I get
Verse #2
Look at these eyes baby blue baby just like urself
If they were brown
Shady lose shady sits on the shelf
But Shadys cute
Shady knew Shady's dimples would help
Make ladies swoon baby
(ooo baby)
Look at myself!
Lets do the math
If I was black I woulda sold half
I aint have to graduate
From Lincoln High School to know that
But I can rap so *** school
Im too cool to go back
Gimme the mic
Show me where the ***in studio's at
When I was underground
No one gave a *** I was white
No lables wanted to sign me
Almost gave up, I was like \"*** it\"
Until I met Dre
The only one who looked past
Gave me a chance
And I lit a fire up under his ass
Helped him get back to the top
Every fan black that I got
Was probly his
In exchange for every white fan that he's got
Like damn we just swapped
Sittin back look at this *** wow
Im like \"My skin,
is it startin to work to my benifit now?\"
Verse #3
See the problem is I speak to suberban kids
Who otherwise
Woulda never knew these words exist
These moms probly woulda never gave 2 squirts of piss
Till I created so much mutha ***in turbulence
Straight out the tube
right into ya livin rooms I came
And kids Flipped

Thats all it took
And they were instantly hooked right in
And they connected wit me too cuz I looked like them
Thats why they put my lyrics up under this microscope
Searchin wit a fine toothed comb
Its like this rope waitin to choke
Tightenin around my throat
Watchin me while I write this like \"I dont like this, NO!\"
All I hear is
Lyrics lyrics constant controversy
Sponsors workin round the clock
To try to stop my concerts early
Surely hip hop is never a problem
In Harlem only In Boston
After it bothered ya fathers
of daughters startin to blossom
Now im catchin the flack from these activists
When they raggin
Actin like im the 1st rapper to smack a bitch and say faggot
***
Just look at me like im ya closest pal
A poster child
the mutha ***in spokesman now!
Chorus
Outro
So to the parents of America
I am the damager aimed at little Erica
To attack her character
The ring leader of the circus of worthless pawns
Sent to lead the march right up to the steps of Congress
And piss on the lawns of the whitehouse
To burn the casket and replace it
with a parental advisory sticker
To spit liquor in the faces of this democracy of hipocracy
*** you Ms Cheeney
*** you Tipper Gore
*** you with the freeness of speech
this divided states of embarrasment will allow me to have
*** You
hahaha!
im just playin america, you know I love you
