                        Bài hát: Sexxx Dreams - Lady Gaga

Last night 
Our lovers choir 
I was thinking about you 
More than I can sway 
And it was kind of dirty 
Oh my, and the way that you looked at me ((help me here)) 
It was kind of nasty ((help me here)) 
It was kind of trashy 
Cause I can't help my mind from going there 

Heard your boyfriend was away this weekend 
Wanna meet at my place 
Heard that we both got nothing to do 
When I lay in bed I touch myself and I think of you 

[Chorus] 
Last night 
Damn you were in my sex dreams 
Doing really nasty things 
Damn you were in my sex dreams 
Making love in my sex dreams 
Making love in my sex dreams 
Making love in my sex dreams 
Making love in my sex dreams 

We could be caught (I just want this to be perfect) 
We're both convicted criminal of thought (cause I'm broken) 
Let's white (by the one before) glove the bed 
He was kinda nasty (help me here) 
And I feel so trashy 
Cause we count to three I unbotton from head 

Heard your boyfriend was away this weekend 
Wanna meet at my place? 
Heard that we both got nothing to do 
When I lay in bed I touch myself and I think of you 

[Chorus] 
Last night 
Damn you were in my sex dreams 
Doing really nasty things 
Damn you were in my sex dreams 
Making love in my sex dreams 
Making love in my sex dreams 
Making love in my sex dreams 
Making love in my sex dreams 

When we were in the swimming pool 
I was gonna show you 
And want this something better 
Dangerously poetry rhyme with that body some other time to look right on the thousand drug 

I can't believe I'm telling you this but I got a couple of drinks and oh my god 

[Chorus] 
Last night 
Damn you were in my sex dreams 
Doing really nasty things 
Damn you were in my sex dreams 
Making love in my sex dreams 
Making love in my sex dreams 
Making love in my sex dreams 
Making love in my sex dreams
                        
                    |
