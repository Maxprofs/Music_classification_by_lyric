                        Bài hát: Sakura - Fujita Maiko

Hira hira mai ochiru
Momo iro no hanabira
Tsunaida kimi no te wo
Gyutto nigitta
Pink petals 
Fluttering down 
I tightly squeezed 
Your hand that i held

Sakura tsudzuku massugu na michi
Kaze ga futari wo sotto tsutsumu
The road lined with cherry blossoms 
Wind gently embracing us

Tonari aruku dake de
Konna shiawase wo
Kanjirareru nante
Shirarnakatta
I did not know 
That it was possible to feel 
This kind of happiness 
Just by walking beside you

Hira hira mai ochiru
Momo iro no hanabira
Kisetsu ga kawattemo
Zutto soba ni ite
Pink petals 
Fluttering down 
Even if seasons change 
Stay by my side

Kimi no sugata ga mieru dake da
Naze ka itsumo anshin dekiru
I wonder why just be seeing you 
I feel so safe

Kurushii koto ga aru to
Kimi ni sasaerarete
Ureshii koto ga aru to
Tsutaetakute
When it gets painful 
You support me 
When something good happens 
I want to share it with you

Ima waratta kao mo
Namae wo yobu koe mo
Kimi jyanakya dame da yo
Dou ka shitte’ite
Your smiling face 
Your vaice calling my name 
If it’s not you, it’s no good 
Please know that

Tatta hitori no hito
Mitsuketa ki ga shiteru
Tonari de kimi mo
Onaji kimochi nara ...
I feel that 
I have found the one 
If you feels the same 
By my side ... ...

Hira hira mai ochiru
Momo’iro no hanabira
Kisetsu ga kawattemo
Zutto soba ni ite
Pink petals 
Fluttering down 
Even if seasons change 
Stay by my side

Rainen mo kono basho de
Suki da to itte
Next year, in this place, tell me again 
That you love me
