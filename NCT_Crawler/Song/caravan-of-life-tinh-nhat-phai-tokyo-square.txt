                        Bài hát: Caravan Of Life (Tình Nhạt Phai) - Tokyo Square

What can you say when see it all just slip away
Wasting up opportunities
A chance when beging but you wouln't play
All you had to do was ask.
I'll quickly give the time to spend
Everything is shown, to see how the years fly by
Things are not a world to think.
There's nothing that can matter change

You get the second change to see
This is good one way
You can't change the day gone by
It doesn't matter how you try
Watch the hands of time not shown
And see the caravan of life go by

And so one day soon
Perhaps you come to know the truth
When my rage was always run
And we have the fate to keep this guy with you
Once again we are, we must
I'll quickly give the time to spend
Everything is shown to see, how the years fly by.
Thought you never realize, though space
You never even tried

You get the second change to see
This is good one way
You can't change the day gone by
It doesn't matter how you try
Watch the hands of time not shown
And see the caravan of life go by
                        
                    |
