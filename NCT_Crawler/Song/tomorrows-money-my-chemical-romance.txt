                        Fell in love with a vampire
You wanna get it for free
Then say hello to the brushfire, baby
You've gotta take it from me,
I've gonna take it from you

Say hello to the good times
And say hello to the sun
Sit back on an empire
While the world lays back
Would you get behind that gun?

If we crash this time
They got machines to keep us alive
When the mix tape plays
Choke down the words with no meaning

I stopped believing three years ago
While you keep screaming for revolution
Me and my surgeons and my streetwalking trash
We got no heroes 'cause our heroes are dead

Say hello to the program
We're gonna give it for free
We've got the things in the antibodies
Got it with the disease
We're gonna give it to you

Say goodbye to the good times
You're loading up with the fame
You're dressing up like a virus
But the words get lost with the radio love machine

If we crash this time
They got machines to keep us alive
When the mix tape plays
Choke down the words with no meaning

I stopped believing three years ago
While you keep screaming for revolution
Me and my surgeons and my streetwalking trash
We got no heroes 'cause our heroes are dead

(Fell in love with a vampire
Tops off? to the empire
Say hello to the brushfire
I think my phone's got a tap wire) x2

Yeah, if we crash this time
They got machines to keep us alive
When the mix tape plays
Choke down the war with no meaning

I stopped believing three years ago
While you keep screaming for revolution
Who kills a boy without the T-shirt you sell
You keep your money and I'll see you in hell
                        
                    |
