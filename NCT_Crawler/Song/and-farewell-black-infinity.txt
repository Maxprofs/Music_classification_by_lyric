Âu Mỹ khác|

                        Blue moon shining on my way
And i can see you smile again
Please come to my grave
when i'm wishpering your name

Silence dancing on my days
With all the red roses, im fading away
Tell me all the dreams that we shared
sanctuary of the hearts

Good bye my Love, good bye my innocence
And time will pass us by
Good bye my sweet love,good bye my memories
And we will be together in the end ( in this grave )
                        
                    |
