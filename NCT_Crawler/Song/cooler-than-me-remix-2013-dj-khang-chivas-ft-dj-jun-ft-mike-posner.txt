                        Bài hát: Cooler Than Me - Mike Posner

If i could write you a song,
And make you fall in love,
I would already have you up under my arm.
I used to pull all my tricks,
I hope that you like this.
But you probably won't,
You think you're cooler than me.

You got designer shades,
Just to hide your face and
You wear them around like
You're cooler than me.
And you never say hey,
Or remember my name.
Its probably cuz,
You think you're cooler than me.

You got your hot crowd,
Shoes on your feet,
And you wear them around,
Like they ain't ***.
But you don't know,
The way that you look,
When your steps
Make that much noise.

See i got you,
All figured out,
You need everyone's eyes just to feel seen.
Girl, your so vain,
You probably think that this song is about you.
Don't you? Don't you?

If i could write you a song,
And make you fall in love,
I would already have you up under my arm.
I used to pull all my tricks,
I hope that you like this.
But you probably won't,
You think you're cooler than me.

You got designer shades,
Just to hide your face and
You wear them around like,
You're cooler than me.
And you never say hey,
Or remember my name.
It's probably cuz,
You think you're cooler than me.

You got your hot crowd,
Switching your walk,
And you don't even look when you pass by.
But you don't know,
The way that you look.
When your steps
Make that much noise.

'Cause it sure seems
('cause it sure seems)
You got no doubt
(that you got no doubt)
But we all see
(we all see)
You got your head in the clouds
(clouds)

If i could write you a song,
And make you fall in love,
I would already have you up under my arm.
I used to pull all my tricks,
I hope that you like this.
But you probably won't,
You think you're cooler than me.

You got designer shades,
Just to hide your face and
You wear them around like,
You're cooler than me.
And you never say hey,
Or remember my name.
Its probably cuz,
You think you're cooler than me.
