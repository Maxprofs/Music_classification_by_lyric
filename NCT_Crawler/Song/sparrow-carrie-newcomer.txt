                        Bài hát: Sparrow - Carrie Newcomer

When the evening like a sparrow
Folds down under its small wings
All the light bones and the feathers of the day
Only then in that moment
Stop the rushing and just hold me
Lay your hands where it hurts
And we'll leave it that way

Well, I have often dreamt of angels
But I very rarely see them
But I know that they've been there
Because something smells like sky
In the rustle of their presence
It's a lot like your breathing
Sounds a lot like a promise
But I can't say why

I have searched all the wise and the unwise places
I have known the price of passion
And what solitude buys
It was you I was looking for in all those faces
Always you I was hoping for
When I closed my eyes

So I will gather all the feathers
That collect up in the corners
All the risings and the fallings
In the quiet of the day
When you speak, there's a flutter
Of some winged thing stirring
Lay your head on my heart
And we'll leave it that way
                        
                    |
