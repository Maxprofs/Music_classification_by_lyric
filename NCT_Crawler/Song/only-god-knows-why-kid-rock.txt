                        I've been sittin' here 
trying to find myself 
i get behind myself 
i need to rewind myself 
looking for the payback 
listen for the playback 
they say that every man 
bleeds just like me 
and i feel like number one 
but yet i'm last in line 
i watch my younger son 
and it helps to pass the time 
i take to many pills 
it helps to ease the pain 
i made a couple dollar bills 
but still i feel the same 
everybody knows my name 
they say it way out loud 
a lot of folks * with me 
it's hard to hang out in crowds 
i guess that's the price you pay 
to be some big shot like i am 
out skirt stands and one night stands 
still i can't find love 

And when your walls come tumbling down 
I will always be around 

People don't know about the things 
i say and do they don't understand 
about the * that i've 
been through, it's been so long 
since i've been home i've been gone, 
i've been gone for way too long 
maybe i forgot all the things I miss 
Oh somehow I know there's more to life 
than this, I said it too many times 
and i still stand firm you get what 
you put in and people get what they 
deserve, still i ain't seen mine 
No I ain't seen mine 
I've been giving just ain't been gettin' 
I've been walking down that line 
So I think I'll keep walking 
with my head held high 
i'll keep moving on and only God 
knows why 

Only God... only God 
Only God knows why 
Only God... knows ... why, why, why only 
God knows why 
Take me to the river hey 
Take me to the river
