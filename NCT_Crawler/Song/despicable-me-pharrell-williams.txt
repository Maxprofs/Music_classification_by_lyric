                        I'm havin' a bad, bad day
It's about time that I get my way
Steamrolling whatever I see
Huh, despicable me

I'm havin' a bad, bad day
If you take it personal, that's okay
Watch, this is so fun to see
Ah, despicable me

Why ask why? Better yet "Why not?"
Why are you marking X on that spot?
Why use a blowtorch, isn't that hot?
Why use a chainsaw? Is that all you got?

Why do you like seeing people in shock?
But my question to you is "Why not?"
Why go to the baker, stand in line
Just use a freeze gun, it saves me time

I'm havin' a bad, bad day
It's about time that I get my way
Steamrolling whatever I see
Huh, despicable me

I'm havin' a bad, bad day
If you take it personal, that's okay
Watch, this is so fun to see
Ah, despicable me

Why ask why when this is art?
Why parallel when I could just park?
Why does Vector think that he's smart?
And does his dad know I know his part?

Why did I have to live with my mom?
Why do you think that I should be calm?
Why want the moon, the world's in my palm
Is it crazy you think I've gone?

I'm havin' a bad, bad day

It's about time that I get my way
Steamrolling whatever I see
Huh, despicable me

I'm havin' a bad, bad day
If you take it personal, that's okay
Watch, this is so fun to see
Ah, despicable me

Excuse me if you will
You look like you have time to kill
Can you chill? 'Cause Groove's got the speakers
And the trunk to make you bounce, bounce
Bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce
To make you bounce, bounce, bounce, bounce

I'm havin' a bad, bad day
It's about time that I get my way
Steamrolling whatever I see
Huh, despicable me

A bad bad day
I'm havin' a bad, bad day
If you take it personal, that's okay
Watch, this is so fun to see
Ah, despicable me

Despicable, despicable
Despicable me, despicable me
Despicable me, despicable me
Despicable me, despicable me

I'm havin' a bad, bad day
It's about time that I get my way
Steamrolling whatever I see
Huh, despicable me

I'm havin' a bad, bad day
If you take it personal, that's okay
Watch, this is so fun to see
Ah, despicable me
