                        What do I gotta do to make it work out do I gotta do
 Yeah, messing around with the fire sign
 You make it feel like the world is after you
 But what can you do? What you gonna do? Now, Mary what are you thinking?
 Mary, when will you learn Now, Mary she ain't helpless
 But Mary she don't feel smart
 But Mary you can't help it
 'Cos growing up is the hardest part But it ain't your fault
 Don't you ever stop Now Mary you keep on thinkin'
 And Mary one day you'll learn What do I gotta do to make it work out do I gotta do
 Messing around with the fire sign
 You make it feel like the world is after you Mary what are you thinkin'?
 Mary when will you learn
