                        Bài hát: Till I Lost - Tom Odell

A coffee stain on a window sill
A bad translation to a foreign film
Or just wondering round with you
Just wondering town with you
Oh oh oh oh
Would be enough

The tiny cracks on the city stone
A welcome back to your troubled home
Or just wondering round with you
Just wondering town with you
oh oh oh oh
Would be enough

But ohhhhhhhhhhhh
I didn't see the sea until I crossed
Ohhhhhhhhh
And I didn't feel your love until I lost

The moving shadows on your swaying light
Or you picture notes of porcupines
Or just wondering round with you
Just wondering town with you
Oh oh oh oh would be enough

But ohhhhhhhhhhhh
I didn't see the sea until I crossed
Ohhhhhhhhh
And I didn't feel your love until I lost
                        
                    |
