                        Bài hát: Who Do You Think You Are - Spice Girls

The race is on to get out of the bottom
The top is high so your roots are forgotten
Giving is good as long as you're getting
What's driving you it's ambition and betting
I said who do you think you are?
(I said who)
Some kind of superstar
You have got to swing it, shake it, move it, make it
who do you think you are?
Trust it, use it, prove it, groove it
show me how good you are
Swing it, shake it, move it, make it
who do you think you are?
Trust it, use it, prove it, groove it
show me how good you are

You're swelling out in the wrong direction
you've got the bug, superstar you've been bitten
Your trumpet's blowing for far too long
playing the snake of the ladder, but you're wrong
I said who do you think you are?
(I said who)
Some kind of superstar
You have got to swing it, shake it, move it, make it
who do you think you are?
Trust it, use it, prove it, groove it
show me how good you are
Swing it, shake it, move it, make it
who do you think you are?
Trust it, use it, prove it, groove it
show me how good you are

You have got to reach on up, never lose your soul
You have got to reach on up, never lose control
I said who do you think you are?
(I said who)
Some kind of superstar
You have got to swing it, shake it, move it, make it
who do you think you are?
Trust it, use it, prove it, groove it
show me how good you are
Swing it, shake it, move it, make it
who do you think you are?
Trust it, use it, prove it, groove it
show me how good you are
Swing it, shake it, move it, make it
(who do you think you are?)
Trust it, use it, prove it, groove it
show me how good you are
