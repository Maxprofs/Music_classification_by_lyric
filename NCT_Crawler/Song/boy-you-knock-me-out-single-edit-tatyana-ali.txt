                        Uh, uh, uh
 Oh oh
 Oh each
 Baby

 From the moment that I saw you, babe
 All I think about is loving you
 Every time that you are near, I just can't help but stare
 I'm dreamin' of eternity with you, so maybe I can

 Run away with you
 Imagine all the things we'd do (Oh, babe)
 Call my name
 I got this fantasy for real (Baby, I can)

 Run away with you
 Imagine all the things we'd do (Just call my name)
 Call my name
 I got this fantasy for real (Oh, no)

 Can't hold it, I can't fight it (Oh oh oh)
 Want you and I can't deny it
 It's all about the things you do
 Boy, you knock me out (I can't hold it)

 Can't hold it, I can't fight it (No)
 Want you and I can't deny it
 It's all about the things you do (Yeah)
 Boy, you knock me out

 Can you feel the vibes I'm sendin', baby
 All my energy and thoughts towards you
 There's now way I could let go of all these dreams and hopes
 Anxieties so deep, feeling so new, just maybe I can

 Run away with you
 Imagine all the things we'd do (Just call my name)
 Call my name
 I got this fantasy for real (Baby, can we)

 Run away with you (Mmm)
 Imagine all the things we'd do (Just call my name)
 Call my name
 I got this fantasy for real ('Cause boy, you knock me out)

 Can't hold it, I can't fight it (Baby, you do)
 Want you and I can't deny it (Mmm, hmm)
 It's all about the things you do
 Boy, you knock me out

 Can't hold it, I can't fight it (Oh, no)
 Want you and I can't deny it
 It's all about the things you do
 Boy, you knock me out (Mmm, hmm)

 Fallin' for you, this love's a tko (Fallin' for you, baby)
 Fallin' for you, baby ('Cause boy, you knock me out, mmm)
 Fallin' for you, this love's a tko (Fallin' for you, baby)
 Fallin' for you, baby

 ('Cause boy, you knock me out, baby) Can't hold it, I can't fight it
 Want you and I can't deny it (I am fallin' for you, baby)
 It's all about the things you do (I'm about to lose control)
 Boy, you knock me out (Oh oh)

 Can't hold it, I can't fight it
 Want you and I can't deny it (Can I run away with you?)
 It's all about the things you do (Imagine all those things we'd do)
 Boy, you knock me out (Oh)

 (Can't hold it) Can't hold it, (I) I can't fight it (Fight it)
 Want you and I can't deny it (I just wanna hold you, baby)
 It's all about the things you do (I just wanna hold you)
 Boy, you knock me out (And I can't hide it)

 (Can't hold it) Can't hold it, (I) I can't fight it [Fight it]
 Want you and I can't deny it (Oh oh whoa oh)
 It's all about the things you do (Baby)
 Boy, you knock me out

 (Can't hold it)Can't hold it, (I) I can't fight it (Fight it)
 Want you and I can't deny it (Boy, you knock me out, oh oh)
 It's all about the things you do (Oh oh oh oh oh oh)
 Boy, you knock me out

 (Can't hold it) Can't hold it, (I) I can't fight it (Fight it)
