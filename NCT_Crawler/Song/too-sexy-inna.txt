                        Bài hát: Too Sexy - Inna

I'm too sexy for your love 
Too sexy for your love 
Too sexy for your 

Too sexy
Too sexy

This dance floor is a jungle, we 'bout to go bananas
Me and my chiquitas, me and my chiquitas
Don't tell me 'bout your helicopter, don't need your bank roll
We got margaritas, we got margaritas

You ain't sayin' nothing, we can do this any time
And we don't need your money cause I'm good at spendin' mine
Turn it up
Turn it up
Turn it up
Let's begin
All my girls go

I'm too sexy for your love
Too sexy for your love
Too sexy for your
Too sexy
I'm too sexy for your love
Too sexy for your love
Too sexy for your
Too sexy
Too sexy
Too sexy

We settin' it on fire, but we don't need no agua
This is pura vida, this is pura vida
Maybe I'm just a party rocker, this is my anthem
They call me Bonita, they call me Bonita

You ain't sayin' nothing, we can do this any time
And we don't need your money cause I'm good at spendin' mine
Turn it up
Turn it up
Turn it up
Let's begin
All my girls go

I'm too sexy for your love
Too sexy for your love
Too sexy for your
Too sexy
I'm too sexy for your love
Too sexy for your love
Too sexy for your
Too sexy
Too sexy
Too sexy

I'm too sexy for your love
Too sexy for your love
Too sexy for your
Too sexy
All my girls go
Too sexy
Too sexy
