                        Bài hát: Unforgettable (The Four Performance) - Zhavia

It's not good enough for me
Since I've been with you, ooh
No it ain't, no it ain't, no
It's not gonna work for you
Nobody can equal me, I know
I'm gonna sip on this drink when I'm messed up
I know how to pick 'em
I'm gonna catch the rhythm while she push up against me, ooh, Is she tipsy?
I've had enough convo for twenty-four
I peeped you from across the room
Pretty little body, dancing like GoGo, aye
And you are unforgettable
I need to get you alone
Why not, why not, why not, why not, why not?
A good time never hurt nobody, got a little drink but it's not Bacardi
If you loved the girl then I'm so, so sorry
Gotta give it to her like we in a marriage
Oh, like we in a hurry
No, no, won't tell nobody
You're on your level too
Tryna do what lovers do
Feelin' like I'm fresh out, Boosie
If they want the drama, got the Uzi
Ship the whole crew to the cruise ship
Doin', you don't even see in movies
Ride with me, ride with me boss
I got a hard head, but her heart soft
She want the last name with the ring on it
'Cause I pulled out a million, told her "plank on it"
And you are unforgettable
I need to get you alone
Now you wanna choose, just pop the bubbly in the 'cuzi
It's not good enough for me
Since I've been with you, ooh
Oh, I'm gonna sip on this drink, when I'm messed up
Sure know how to pick 'em
I'm gonna catch the rhythm while she push up against me, ooh, Is she tipsy?
I've had enough convo for Twenty-four
I peep'd you from across the room
Pretty little body dancin' like go-go, aye
And you are unforgettable
I need to get you alone
Why not, why not, why not, why not, why not?
A good time never hurt nobody, got a little drink but it's not Bacardi
If you loved the girl, then I'm so, so sorry
Gotta give it to her like we in a marriage
Oh, like we in a hurry
No, no, won't tell nobody
You're on your level too
Tryna do what lovers do
And you are unforgettable
