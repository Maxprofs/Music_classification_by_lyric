                        Bài hát: Look What You Made Me Do (Taylor Swift Cover) - Madilyn Bailey, Sam Tsui

I don't like your little games 
Don't like your tilted stage 
The role you made me play 
Of the fool, no, I don't like you
I don't like your perfect crime 
How you laugh when you lie 
You said the gun was mine 
Isn't cool, no, i don't like you 

OH 
But t got smarter, I got harder in the nick of time 
Honey, I rose up from the dead 
I do it all the time 
I've got a list of name and your is in red , underline 
I check it once, then I check it twice 

OH
Look what you made me do ( x2 ) 
Look what you just made me do , OH 
Look what you made me do (x2 ) 
Look what you just made me do ( x2 ) 
I don't like your kingdom keys
They once belonged to me 
You ask me for a place to sleep 
Locked me out and threw a feast ( WHAT ) 
The world moves on another day another drama, drama 
But not for me, not for me all I think about is krama 
And then
                        
                    |
