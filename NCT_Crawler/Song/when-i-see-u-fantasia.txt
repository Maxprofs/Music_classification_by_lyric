                        I put your picture on my mirror
 Start to blush when somebody says your name
 In my stomach there's a pain
 See you walk in my direction
 I go the other way
 I start to stutter when I speak
 Start to stand but my knees go weak
 What's happening to me?
 In the dark, can you tell me what it means? I lay my head on my pillow
 Staring out the window
 Wish on a star for a sign
 You're the reason why You're always on my mind
 When you come around I get shy
 When I see you (See you)
 When I see you I never know when you might walk by
 So I gotta be right on time
 When I see you
 When I see you I scribble x and O's in my notebook
 Checking how my hair and my nails look
 I feel myself in a zone
 I get nervous when you call
 So I say I'm not home
 I see your face
 And I hear my favorite song
 Should I send an e-mail at home?
 You're the number one topic on the phone
 I wonder if you know or do you have a clue, yeah I lay my head on my pillow
 You got me staring out the window
 Wish on a star for a sign
 What's the reason why, yeah yeah yeah You're always on my mind (You're always)
 When you come around I get shy
 When I see you (So sexy boy)
 When I see you (You're sexy boy) I never know when you might walk by
 So I gotta be right on time
 When I see you
 When I see you Something now is taking over me
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
 I'm not gonna run not
 Just gonna stand here and see
 Oh, oh, oh, yeah You're always on my mind (Hey baby)
 When you come around I get shy
 When I see you
 When I see you (You're so sexy boy, you're so sexy boy) I never know when you might walk by (I don't know)
 So I gotta be right on time
 When I see you (But I get nervous around you)
 When I see you You're always on my mind (You're always)
 When you come around I get shy
 When I see you (You, you, you)
 When I see you (I love it, I love it) I never know when you might walk by
 (Yes I love it boy)
 So I gotta be right on time
 When I see you
 When I see you (For some reason I can't, I can't be around) Hey
 I can't
 Only when I see you
