                        Stepped out the door 2am yesterday
 Me and my friend keeping the night aflame
 And as we're walking in the clear lamplight
 Two guys come up and take him out of sight Fore I know what's what
 They hit him hard, he doubles up
 They take his money and they run
 And all I can do is watch them go
 His hands are round his nose
 His blood is on his clothes What doesn't kill ya?
 What doesn't hurt?
 Sometimes you feel you're up against the world
 What doesn't kill ya?
 What doesn't break? This life it seems can bring you to your knees
 You try you bleed, then finally you breathe She was the dream that kept me up at night
 I couldn't face the world without her eyes
 I never knew until she disappeared
 My life would be a bunch of souvenirs Fore I know what's what
 It hits her hard, she doubles up
 She packs her bag and then she runs
 And all I can do is watch her go
 I've lost all I own What doesn't kill ya?
 What doesn't hurt?
 Sometimes you feel you're up against the world what doesn't kill ya?
 What doesn't break?
 This life it seems can bring you to your knees
 You try you bleed, then finally you breathe
                        
                    |
