                        All alone, nothing to do
 It's lonely here without you
 The candlelight is burning low
 The love songs on the radio
 And memories are all I have to show Photographs, tickets for two
 Promises that all fell through
 Now, ev'rything's in black and white
 The colors faded with the light
 The stars we used to wish upon
 Have somehow lost their light Where is the feeling we used to know?
 Where is the music that played?
 What happened to the love that used to show?
 Where did the feeling go? Thoughts of you fill my mind
 Paperbacks to pass the time
 And, as I lie awake tonight
 I'll leave the porch light burning bright
 And miss the loving arms
 That used to hold me tight Where is the feeling we used to know?
 Where is the music that played?
 What happened to the love that used to show?
 Where did the feeling go? Where is the feeling we used to know?
 Where is the music that played?
 What happened to the love that used to show?
 Where did the feeling go? What happened to the love that used to show?
 Where did the feeling go?
                        
                    |
