                        Bài hát: Real Love - Tom Odell

All my little plans and schemes
Lost like some forgotten dream
Seems like all I really was doing
Was waiting for you

Just like little girls and boys
Playing with their little toys
Seems like all we really were doing
Was waiting for love

Don't need to be alone
Don't need to be alone
It's real love
It's real,
It's real love
It's real

It's real love
It's real
                        
                    |
