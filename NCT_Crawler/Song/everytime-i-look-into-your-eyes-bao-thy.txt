                        Bài Hát: Everytime I Look Into Your Eyes - Bảo Thy

I still hear your voice around, 
Like an echo, everything in a mess 
Why this feeling turn so cold, 
Freezing in the darkness 
So alone 
Everytime I look into your eyes 
I can tell you our love is still alive 
It's killing me Oh baby 

Everytime you look into my eyes 
I rather hear the truth than live in all your lies 
I'm so lost, i'm hurt for you 
How could I survive???

Why this feeling turn so cold, 
Freezing in the darkness 
So alone 
Everytime I look into your eyes 
I can tell you our love is still alive 
It's killing me Oh baby 

Everytime you look into my eyes 
I rather hear the truth than live in all your lies 
I'm so lost, i'm hurt for you 
How could I survive???

Would it be the very last kiss?
All those memories, all those sorrows stay or gone 


Everytime I look into your eyes 
I can tell you our love is still alive 
It's killing me Oh baby 

Everytime you look into my eyes 
I rather hear the truth than live in all your lies 
I'm so lost, i'm hurt for you 
How could I survive???
