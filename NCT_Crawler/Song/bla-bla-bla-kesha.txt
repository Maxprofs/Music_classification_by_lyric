                        Bài hát: Bla bla bla - Ke$ha

Coming oot your mouth with your blah blah blah.
Just zip your lips like a padlock and meet me at the back 
with the jack and the jukebox.
I dont really care where you live at just turn around boy 
and let me hit that.
dont be a little bitch with your chit chat 
just show me where your dicks at.
music starts
listen hot stuff
im in love
with this song
so just hush baby shut up
heard enough
stop stop stop talking that
blah blah blah think youl be getting this nah nah nah
not in the back of my car car car
if you keep talking that blah blah blah blah blah.
Boy come on now ' ' '
Come put a little love it my glove bag
i wanna dance with no pants on

come meet me in the back with the jack and the jukebox
so cut to the chase kid cuz i no you dont care what my middle name is
I wanna be naked but your wasted
