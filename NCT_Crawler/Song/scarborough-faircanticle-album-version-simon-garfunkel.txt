                        Bài hát: Scarborough Fair/Canticle (Album Version) - Simon & Garfunkel

Are you going to Scarborough Fair
Parsley sage, rosemary and thyme
Remember me to one who lives there
She once was a true love of mine

Tell her to make me a cambric shirt 
(On the side of a hill in the deep forest green)
Parsley ,sage, rosemary and thyme 
(Tracing of sparrow on snow crested brown)
Without no seams nor needle work
(Blankets and bed clothes the child of the mountain)
Then she'll be a true love of mine 
(Sleeps unaware of the clarion call)
Tell her to find me an acre of land
(on the side of a hill sprinkling of leaves)
Parsley ,sage, rosemary and thyme
( Washes the grave with silvery tears)
Between the salt water and the sea strand 
(A soldier cleans and polishes a gun)
Then she'll be a true love of mine 
Tell het to reap it with a sickle of leather
(War bellows blazing in scarlet battalions)
Generals order their soldier to kill 
And togerther it all in a bunch of heather
(and to fight for a caused they've long ago forgotten)
Then she'll be a true love of mine
                        
                    |
