                        I get drunk and I stumble to the phone
 Conjure up a bitch to bone when I'm alone
 *** up, tore back, I need to take a piss
 Only when I'm drunk, I sing a song like this My grandma and your grandma, sittin' by the fire
 Hold on, turn that beat off Nah, keep it going
 Crazy Town, yo y'all just not known'
 I get drunk and start talking more ***
 And when I got a gun in my hand, you better get out
 'Cause my brain just ain't what it used to be
 Forget trying to rationalize, cover your eyes I get uh, damn I'm drunk
 I need a chunk, no better yet
 A hunk of that funk
 I get uh, damn I'm drunk
 I need a chunk, no better yet
 A hunk of that funk Yeah, I'm good bad, dope I'm freaky fresh
 I make hip-hop fans say yes, yes
 Crazy's comin' through you know we're gonna blow up
 Hold up, wait, I think I'm gonna throw up False alarm, I'm getting all ladies with my cool charm
 When I get drunk, I might even call my daddy a punk Yeah, but only when I'm drunk
 Yeah, only when I'm drunk
 Only when I'm drunk
 Yeah, only when I'm drunk
 It happens only when I'm drunk It goes, one for the chronic, two for the amnesia
 I'm the crazy white boy with the drinks in the freezer
 Bust a one out, two out blitz type of rapper
 That will get you out of your seat quicker than a car jacker Sippin' colt forty fever, when I'm coolin' with my people
 Got ho's in East Columbus like I'm Billy D. Rico
 'Cause I move like, I'm smooth like I'm Harry Belafonte
 Lookin' for them suckers that jumped my homey Le Le All up in this bitch with the Gin and Tanqueray
 Drink like Mr.Wendall, smoke bud like Dr. Dre
 That's 'cause I'm old enough to do that type of ***
 ***, I gotta piss, I pass the mic to Mr. Shift I get drunk and can't nobody whoop me
 I'm trippin' it must be that brew that I was sippin'
 Kickin' in, guess I shouldn't have mixed it with the Gin
 'Cause when I'm laying on my back I can feel the room spin One too many, I reckon, feelin' I got to hurl any second
 Want to get up but can't move
 Feels like I'm stuck in a groove
 What the *** was I trying to prove? I got a knack for downin' four-o's
 All the ho's know them doobie bros
 People call me Shift, I keep a fifth in my trunk
 I might *** an ugly bitch, but only when I'm drunk Yeah, only when I'm drunk
 Only when I'm drunk
 Yeah, only when I'm drunk
 It happens only when I'm drunk
 Yeah, one, two, one, two
 Only when I'm drunk One, two, one, two
 Only when I'm drunk
 One, two, one, two
 Only when I'm drunk
 One, two, one, two
 Only when I'm drunk
