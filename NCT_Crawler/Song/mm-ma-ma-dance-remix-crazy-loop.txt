Mm-ma-ma-ma-ma 

Ma-ma-ma. 



Taking pictures with hotties 

Spending all mo-mo-money 

If you want it so badly 

Then why don't you say so, lady. 



You'll be hurt if you'll kiss me 

You gotta gotta believe me 

But if you want it so badly 

Then why don't you say so, lady. 



And If you'd wanna take it back 

You don't wanna take it back 

You don't wanna take it back, my love 

Don't you wanna love? 

Babe,you don't wanna take it back 

Don't wanna take it back 

Back, back, back. 



They call me Crazy Loop 

Gotta gotta be crazy loop 

Gotta get a lïfe 

Oh, mom, I've tried 

Gotta gotta be lonely-lon-lon-lon. (2x)
