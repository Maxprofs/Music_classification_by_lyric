This summer's gonna hurt like a motherfucker
Fucker
This summer's gonna hurt like a motherfucker
Fucker
Her body's hot
Her body's like the summer
I'm in a trance or something
Her mind is not, no
As sharp as all her diamonds
She must be smoking something
I see her dancing in the streets
Sipping champagne on the beach
So expensive when she eats
Cause she's so fancy
I see her when I go to sleep
I check my phone when I am weak
She never posts anything deep
Cause she's so fancy

This summer's gonna hurt like a motherfucker
Fucker
This summer's gonna hurt like a motherfucker
Fucker

This summer's gonna hurt like a motherfucker
Fucker
This summer's gonna hurt like a motherfucker
Fucker

Has to have it all
Chases every star
She's so popular
Has to have it all
Chases every star
She's so popular

This summer's gonna
This summer's gonna hurt
This summer's gonna
