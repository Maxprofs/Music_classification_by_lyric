                        Trong ca khúc này, ca sỹ kiêm nhạc sỹ Laura Shigihara đã thể hiện phần lời thoại của nhân vật hoa hướng dương (sunflower) và nhà chế tạo game George Fan đã thể hiện phần lời thoại của các nhân vật thây ma (zombie). Dưới đây là lời bài hát:


SUNFLOWER:
Sunflower
1, 2, 3! (Whew!)

CHORUS - SUNFLOWER:
There's a zombie on your lawn
There's a zombie on your lawn
There's a zombie on your lawn
We don't want zombies on the lawn.

SUNFLOWER:
I know your type: tall, dark, and dead
You want to bite all the petals off of my head
And then eat the brains of the one who planted me here
I'm just a sunflower but see me power an entire infantry
You like the taste of brains, we don't like zombies
FOOTBALL ZOMBIE: I used to play football (SUNFLOWER: Football)
CONEHEAD ZOMBIE: Road cones protect my head (SUNFLOWER: Cone on his head)
SCREEN DOOR ZOMBIE: I have a screen-door shield (SUNFLOWER: Screen-door shield)
ALL ZOMBIES: We are the undead!

REPEAT CHORUS - SUNFLOWER

SUNFLOWER:
Maybe it's time to reevaluate
I know you have a lot of food on your plate
Brains are quite rich in cholesterol
You're dead so it doesn't matter,
Instead we'll use this solar power to make a lawn defense at any hour
DIGGER ZOMBIE: I like your tricycle (SUNFLOWER: Tricycle)
BUTTERED ZOMBIE: There's butter on my head (SUNFLOWER: On his head)
DOLPHIN ZOMBIE: I'm gonna eat your brains (SUNFLOWER: No no no no)
ALL ZOMBIES EXCEPT DOLPHIN ZOMBIE: We are the undead! (DOLPHIN ZOMBIE: We are so the undead)

REPEAT CHORUS - SUNFLOWER.
                        
                    |
