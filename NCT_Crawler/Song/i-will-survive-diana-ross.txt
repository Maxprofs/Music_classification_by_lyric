                        At first I was afraid, I was petrified
 Kept thinkin' I could never live without you by my side
 Then I spent so many nights thinking how you did me wrong
 And I grew strong and I learned how to get along And so you're back from outer space
 I just walked in to find you here with that sad look upon your face
 Should have changed that stupid lock
 I should have made you leave your key
 If I had known for just one second you'd be back to bother me Go on now, go walk out the door
 Just turn around now 'coz you're not welcome anymore
 Weren't you the one who tried to break me with goodbye?
 Did you think I'd crumble, did you think I'd lay down and die? Oh no not I, I will survive
 For as long as I know how to love I know I'll stay alive
 I've got all my life to live and I've got all my love to give
 I'll survive, I will survive, hey hey (I, I will survive)
 Hey hey
 (I, I will survive)
 Every day
 (I, I will survive)
 Oh yeah It took all the strength I had not to fall apart
 Just trying hard to mend the pieces of my broken heart
 And I spent oh so many nights just feeling sorry for myself
 I used to cry but now I hold my head up high And you see me, somebody new
 I'm not that chained up little person still in love with you
 And so you felt like dropping in and just expect me to be free
 But now I'm savin' all my lovin' for someone who's lovin' me Go on now, go walk out the door
 Just turn around now, you're not welcome anymore
 Weren't you the one who tried to break me with goodbye?
 Did you think I'd crumble, did you think I'd lay down and die? Oh no not I, I will survive
 For as long as I know how to love I know I'll stay alive
 I've got all my life to live and I've got all my love to give
 I'll survive, I will survive, hey hey Go on now, go walk out the door
 Just turn around now, 'coz you're not welcome anymore
 Weren't you the one who tried to break me with goodbye?
 Did you think I'd crumble, did you think I'd lay down and die? Oh no not I, I will survive
 For as long as I know how to love I know I'll stay alive
 I've got all my life to live and I've got all my love to give
 I'll survive, I will survive I will survive
 (I, I will survive)
 Hey
 (I, I will survive)
 Every day
 (I, I will survive)
 Yeah yeah (I, I, I)
 Oh yeah
 (I, I will survive)
 Ooh
 (I, I will survive)
 I will survive
 (I, I will survive)
