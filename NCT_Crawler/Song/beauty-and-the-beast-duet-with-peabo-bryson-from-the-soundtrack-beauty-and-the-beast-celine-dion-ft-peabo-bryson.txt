                        Bài hát: Beauty and the Beast (Duet with Peabo Bryson from the Soundtrack "Beauty and the Beast") - Celine Dion, Peabo Bryson

Tale As Old As Time 
True As It Can Be 
Barely Even Friends 
Than Somebody Bends 
Unexpectedly 

Just A Little Change 
Small To Say The Least 
Both A Little Scared 
Neither One Prepared 
Beauty And The Beast 

Ever Just The Same 
Ever A Surprise 
Ever As Before 
Ever Just As Sure 

As The Sun Will Arise 

Tale As Old As Time 
Tune As Old As Song 
Bittersweet And Strange 
Finding You Can Change 
Learning You Were Wrong 

Certain As The Sun 
Rising In The East 
Tale As Old As Time 
Song As Old As Rhyme 
Beauty And The Beast
                        
                    |
