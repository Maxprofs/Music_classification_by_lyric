                        Bài hát: Let It Whip - The Treblemakers

Wanna see you whip it
Sure' could treat you right
Give me just a minute
Of your time tonight
We both are here to have the fun
So let it whip
Know you're into groovin'
Love your body language
Baby, let me know
You've got me sort of anxious
We both are here to have the fun
So let it whip

So let it whip
(Let's whip it, baby)
Child
(Let's whip it right)
Get a grip
(Let's whip it baby)
(Whip it all night)
Well, what's your trip
(Oh no)
Child
Cmon let it whip

Now that you can see
How you groove with me
What else can I do
To get closer to you
We both are here to have the fun
So let it whip
We have the natural feeling
Obviously revealing
Let me be your paper man
I'd love to be your joker man
We both are here to have the fun
So let it whip

So let it whip
(Let's whip it baby)
Child
(Let's whip it right)
Get a grip
(Let's whip it baby)
(Whip it all night)
Well, what's your trip
(Oh no)
Child
C'mon let it whip

(There's no time to lose)
There is no time to lose
(You're the one I choose)
(You're so right)
You're the one I choose
I only wanna be with you
You're the one for me
Can't you see that I
(I won't waste your time)
I won't waste your time
(I sense something divine in you)
Something divine in you
(Yes I do)
Oooh-hoo
