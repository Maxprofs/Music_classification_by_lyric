                        Song: That Old King James - Scotty McCreery

Preacher gave it to him when he was eight,
 That Sunday morning he got saved in that little church
 Grandaddy totted it to Bible school
 I bet back then it looked brand new, not a faded word
 Now the cover's torn and the leather's worn... On that Old King James

 He took it with him overseas, England, France and Germany
 Right there in the middle of hell
 Said he read it every night, he swore that it'd saved his life
 His only hope when there was no hope left
 Was in that Old King James

 Passed it down to Momma on the day he died
 Sat there for the longest time just gathering the dust
 But when life would take a sharp turn every now and then
 And she would just start missing him, I'd see her pick it up
 Now the cover's torn and the leather's worn... On that Old King James

 You'll find on every other page, yellow lines or tear drop stains
 Every chapter of that good book
 Been through cancer, war and crazy kids, all the stupids things I did
 I may never know the toll I took... On her and that Old King James

 Yeah I'm the one who's got it now,
 She said read it when you're feeling down and I said Yes Ma'am
 Now the cover's torn and the leather's worn... On that Old King James—Ñ
