                        Bài hát: Fallen Star - Kamelot

You are my reason to stay
Even if daylight’s a lifetime away
May the kings and the queens of the dawn
Remember my name
As dark as the fallen star
My song for the children unforgiven

Sometimes the weight of the world’s
Coming over me
A feeling I can’t forget
Sometimes I find myself caught in a storm
And my future’s a nightmare away
When I’m dreaming

Sometimes I fear
I am losing your sympathies
A liar demands respect
Sometimes I fell I am losing control
And feed on the absence of love

Walking this world like animals
And into the light we’re fading

You are my reason to stay
Even if daylight’s a lifetime away
May the kings and the queens of the dawn
Remember my name
As dark as the fallen star
My song for the children unforgiven

Sometimes I’m lost in the silence of empathy
A moment I can’t reflect
Sometimes I feel like I’m loosing control
And feed on the essence of hate

Walking this world like animals
And into the dark we’re wading

You are my reason to stay
Even if daylight’s a lifetime away
May the kings and the queens of the dawn
Remember my name
As dark as the fallen star
My song for the children unforgiven

Somewhere in time
A story seldom told
Somewhere in history
Our destiny behold...

In the dead of the night I’m just a corpse
Awoken the enemy sleeping inside
In the eye of the storm we’re just the same

'cause you are my reason to stay
Even if daylight’s a lifetime away
May the kings and the queens of the dawn
Remember my name
As dark as the fallen star
My song for the children unforgiven
My song for the lost
My song for the children unforgiven
                        
                    |
