                        Bài hát: Think Of Me - David Archuleta

Think of me
Think of me fondly when we've said goodbye
Remember me once in a while, please promise me you'll try
When you find that once again you long to take your heart back and be free...
If you ever find a moment, spare a thought for me.

We never said our love was evergreen
Or as unchanging as the sea.
But if you can still remember
Stop and think of me.

Think of all the things we've said and seen,
Don't think about the things which might have been.

Think of me,
Think of me waking, silent and resigned.
Imagine me
Trying too hard to put you from my mind.
Recall those days, look back on all those times,
Think of the things we'll never do.
There will never be a day when I won't think of you!

Think of me, please say you'll think of me
Whenever I ask you just to do
There will never be a day when I won't think of you!.

Never be a day I won't ever think of you.
                        
                    |
