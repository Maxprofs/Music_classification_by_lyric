                        Everybody's got their problems, 
Everybody says the same thing to you. 
It's just a matter of how you solve them, 
And knowing how to change the things you've been through. 

I feel I've come to realize, 
How fast life can be compromised. 
Step back to see what's going on, 
I can't believe this happened to you. 
This happened to you. 

It's just a problem that we're faced with, am I 
Not the only one who hates to stand by. 
Complications ended first in this line, 
With all these pictures running through my mind. 

Knowing endless consequences, 
I feel so useless in this. 
Get back, step back, and as for me, 
I can't believe. 

Part of me, won't agree, 
Cause I don't know if it's for sure. 
Suddenly, suddenly 
I don't feel so insecure. 

Part of me, won't agree, 
Cause I don't know if it's for sure. 
Suddenly, suddenly 
I don't feel so insecure. 
Anymore 
So 

Everybody's got their problems, 
Everybody says the same thing to you. 
It's just a matter of how you solve them, 
What else are we supposed to do? 

Part of me, won't agree, 
Cause I don't know if it's for sure. 
Suddenly, suddenly 
I don't feel so insecure. 

Part of me, won't agree, 
Cause I don't know if it's for sure. 
Suddenly, suddenly 
I don't feel so insecure. 
Anymore 

Why do things that matter the most, 
Never end up being what we chose. 
(Anymore) 
Now that I find no way so bad, 
I don't think I knew what I had. 
(Anymore) 

Why do things that matter the most, 
Never end up being what we chose. 
(Anymore) 
Now that I find no way so bad, 
I don't think I knew what I had.
