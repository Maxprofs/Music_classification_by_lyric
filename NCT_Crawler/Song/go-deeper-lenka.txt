                        Bài hát: Go Deeper - Lenka

If you only scraws the sofa
Why you only live scars?
And only in darkness
Can you see the stars?
Someone call the doctor
'Cause I can see in your eyes
All the deep is the under
Where the deep secrets high
Come on, let go
We'll go go go go deeper
We've got to go
Go, you know we'll go deeper
And deep still
Still under all the lies
We'll go deeper all the time
Want you see the under?
Under need the moors
Oh, you only to under
You only need to ask
You know we've got to go
We'll go go go go deeper
We've got to go
Go, you know we'll go deeper
And deep still
Still under all the lies
Ahooh Ahooh
It's scar in dark,
dont need scar in dark
Let me like the rain
I like the way for you
So you can go
We'll go go go go deeper
We've got to go
We'll go go go go deeper
And deep still
Still under all the lies
We'll go deeper all the time
Yeah, we'll go deeper all the time
