                        Bài hát: Un Love Me - Leona Lewis

Waiting, sitting in the front seat,
Which one of us will be
The first one to leave?

Empty, out of words,
We're spinning, going in circles.
Why we won't let this die?

It doesn't matter
All the times you broke my heart
When I'm alone
Wish you'd be with me in the dark,
But when you're here you know
We always fall apart,
We're better off on our own.

Wish I could tell you goodbye,
But I won't, 'cause every time that I try
I can't let go, I'm begging you to
Un love me, un love me, un love me.
'Cause I can't un love you.

Forcing, even though we're broken,
We keep holding on to these
Distant memories.

And now you know I saw those pictures on your phone
And you don't even bother ask me where I go
When I don't make it home
Now everybody knows we're better off on our own.

Wish I could tell you goodbye,
But I won't, 'cause every time that I try
I can't let go, I'm begging you to
Un love me, un love me, un love me.
'Cause I
Now I sure wanna be free,
But I don't, 'cause I still wanna believe you're the one.
I'm begging you to un love me, un love me, un love me,
'Cause I can't un love you.

I can't un love you, I, I can't un love you,
I can't un love you, I, I can't un love you,
I can't un love you, I, I can't un love you,
I can't un love you, I...

Wish I could say you goodbye,
'Cause every time that I try
I'm begging you to un love me, un love me, un love me,
'Cause now you now I sure wanna be free.
But I don't, 'cause I still wanna believe you're the one.
I'm begging you to un love me, un love me, un love me,
'Cause I can't un love you.

I can't un love you, I, I can't un love you,
I can't un love you, I, I can't un love you,
I can't un love you, I, I can't un love you,
I can't un love you,
'Cause I can't un love you.
