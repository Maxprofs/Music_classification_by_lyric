                        Bài hát: Peace Train - Cat Stevens

Now, I've been happy lately
Thinking about the good things to come
And I believe it could be
Something good has begun

Oh, I've been smiling lately
Dreaming about the world as one
And I believe it could be
Someday it's going to come

'Cause out on the edge of darkness
There rides the Peace Train
Oh, Peace Train, take this country
Come take me home again

Now, I've been smiling lately
Thinking about the good things to come
And I believe it could be
Something good has begun

[Chorus:]
Oh, Peace Train sounding louder
Ride on the Peace Train
Hoo-ah-eeh-ah-hoo-ah
Come on the Peace Train

Yes, Peace Train's a holy roller
Everyone jump on the Peace Train
Hoo-ah-eeh-ah-hoo-ah
Come on the Peace Train

Get your bags together
Come bring your good friends too
Because it's getting nearer
It soon will be with you

Come and join the living
It's not so far from you
And it's getting nearer
Soon it will all be true

(Chorus)

Now, I've been crying lately
Thinking about the world as it is
Why must we go on hating?
Why can't we live in bliss?

'Cause out on the edge of darkness
There rides the Peace Train
Peace Train take this country
Come take me home again

(Chorus)

'Cause Peace Train's a holy roller
Everyone jump on the Peace Train
Hoo-ah-eeh-ah-hoo-ah
Come on, come on, come on

Yes, come on Peace Train
This is the Peace Train

Hoo-ah-eeh-ah-hoo-ah
Come on the Peace Train
The Peace Train

Hoo-ah-eeh-ah-hoo-ah
                        
                    |
