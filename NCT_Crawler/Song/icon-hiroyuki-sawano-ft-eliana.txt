                        Bài hát : Icon - Hiroyuki Sawano, Eliana

Where you now? 
Wash away this day of hurt 
But your bleeding scars remind you of that barricade 
Tell me how you keep your focus and are intent 
Although the crowds' memories must be decayed 

Some little ironies called tragedies so silently 
And you face their gravity in agony though 
Don't be afraid 
The daybreak has come and there's no curtain to call 
No regrets are needed among the world of you and I 
You know we have made every damn single mistake 
That's what it's all about, the life we belong 

Where you now? 
Have you stripped your spirit down? 
Cause we made you so, to be our lethal grenade 
Here I am praying for your peace and now 
Won't you hear me like a confessy serenade? 

Some little ironies called tragedies so silently 
And you face their gravity in agony though 
Don't be afraid 
The daybreak has come and there's no curtain to call 
No regrets are needed among the world of you and I 
You know we have made every damn single mistake 
That's what it's all about, the life we belong 

Hearts bruise easily 
How much strength our bodies have achieved 
Won't you please forgive yourself? 
And then tears will go above the sky 
So sob bitterly in my arms 
Just let go selfishly 
You don't have to feel your guilt 
That you walk ahead of your hope 

Don't be afraid 
The daybreak has come and there's no curtain to call 
No regrets are needed among the world of you and I 
You know we have made every damn single mistake 
That's what it's all about, the life we survive 

Don't be afraid, daybreak has come (x4)
                        
                    |
