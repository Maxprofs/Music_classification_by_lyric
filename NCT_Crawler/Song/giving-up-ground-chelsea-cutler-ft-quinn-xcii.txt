                        Bài hát: Giving Up Ground - Chelsea Cutler, Quinn XCII

[Verse 1: Chelsea Cutler]
Everybody knows that it don't feel right
I was waiting up in your darkest nights
Why's it always hurt when you need it most
Never wanted love, I just fake my part
Never got enough when I wanted your heart
Why do I just sink when I'm trying to float

[Chorus: Chelsea Cutler]
But you know I'm done pretending I'm wrong when it's not my fault
And baby, I'm done pretending it's love, when it's not your all
Tell the next girl all the things that you told me
All you let slip, 'cause you were hurt and you were lonely
I've found that giving up ground ain't what I want

[Verse 2: Quinn XCII]
Both our names carved in my bedroom door
Nightmares of you and I we can't ignore
How was I sold on the idea of us in the first place?
For sale signs on whatever once was ours
Hate saying you're the reason I have these scars
But you left me thinking that I was out of line
To need space

[Chorus: Quinn XCII]
But you know I'm done pretending I'm wrong when it's not my fault
And baby, I'm done pretending it's love, when it's not your all
Tell the next guy all the things that you told me
All you let slip, 'cause you were hurt and you were lonely
I've found that giving up ground ain't what I want
                        
                    |
