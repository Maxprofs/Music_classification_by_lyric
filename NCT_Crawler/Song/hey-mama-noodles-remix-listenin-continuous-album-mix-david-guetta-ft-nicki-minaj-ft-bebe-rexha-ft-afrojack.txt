                        Song: Hey Mama (Noodles Remix) (Listeninâ€™ Continuous Album Mix) - David Guetta, Nicki Minaj, Bebe Rexha, Afrojack

Yes I'll be your woman
Yes I'll be your baby
Yes I'll be whatever that you tell me when you're ready
Yes I'll be your girl
forever your lady
You ain't ever gotta worry
I'm down for you baby
Best believe that
when you need that
I'll provide that
you will always have it
I'll be on deck
keep it in check
When you need that
I'm a let you have it

Beating my drum like dum di di day
I like the dirty rhythm you play
I wanna hear you callin' my name
Like hey ma ma mama
hey ma mama
Banging the drum like dum di di day
I know you want it in the worst way
I wanna hear you callin' my name
Like hey ma ma mama
hey ma, mama
