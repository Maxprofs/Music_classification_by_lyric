Avril Lavigne - Not Enough

I'm sorry
If this hurts you
But I tried to keep what we had once I was wrong
It wasn't keeping me awake

You didn't listen (You didn't listen)
You didn't hear me (You didn't hear me)
When I said I want more
I got no more
You were stealing me away
Oh

It's not enough, it's not enough to get me
What it is I want
It's not enough, it's not enough to get me
Everything I need
And I, I wish it was
I think it's time
To give this up

Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh

All the memories
That we're losing
All the time that I spent with you everyday
I think it's running down the drain

I'm feeling (feeling)
That we're fading
Don't make this as hard as you think you'd be
It's a lot easier than it seems
Yeah

It's not enough, it's not enough to get me
What it is I want
It's not enough, it's not enough to get me
Everything I need
And I, I wish it was
I think it's time
To give this up

And I can feel it falling down
Slowly, slowly
I can see you're starting to drown
Can't stop it now
I can see ya burning out
So show me, show me
How are ya gonna turn it around because...

It's not enough, it's not enough to give me
What it is I want
It's not enough, it's not enough to get me
Everything I need
It's not enough,it's not enough to get me
What it is I want
It's not enough, it's not enough to get me
Everything I need
And I, I wish it was
I think it's time
To give this up

It's not enough, it's not enough
(To get me)
It's not enough, it's not enough
(What it is I want)
It's not enough, it's not enough
(To get me)
