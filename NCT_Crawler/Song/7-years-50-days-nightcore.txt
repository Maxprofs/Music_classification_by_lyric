                        Bài hát: 7 Years 50 Days - Nightcore

Seven years and fifty days
The time is passing by
Nothing in this world could be
As nice as you and I

And how could we break up like this
And how could we be wrong
So many years, so many days
And I still sing my song

Now I run to you
Like I always do
When I close my eyes
I think of you
Such a lonely girl
Such a lonely world
When I close my eyes 
I dream

I'll return to you
Like I always do
When I close my eyes
I think of you
Such a lonely girl
Such a lonely world
When I close my eyes 
I dream of you

Seven years and fifty days
Now just look at me
Another girl I used to be
So then what do you see

And how could we break up like this
And how could we be wrong
So many years, so many days
And I still sing my song

Now I run to you
Like I always do
When I close my eyes
I think of you
Such a lonely girl
Such a lonely world
When I close my eyes 
I dream

I'll return to you
Like I always do
When I close my eyes
I think of you
Such a lonely girl
Such a lonely world
When I close my eyes 
I dream of you

Seven years and fifty days
The time is passing by
Nothing in this world could be
As nice as you and I

And how could we break up like this
And how could we be wrong
So many years, so many days
And I still sing my song

Now I run to you
Like I always do
When I close my eyes
I think of you
Such a lonely girl
Such a lonely world
When I close my eyes 
I dream

I'll return to you
Like I always do
When I close my eyes
I think of you
Such a lonely girl
Such a lonely world
When I close my eyes 
I dream of you
                        
                    |
