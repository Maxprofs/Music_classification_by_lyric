                        You know I can't smile without you, 
I can't smile without you, 
I can't laugh and I can't sing, 
I find it is hard to do anything.
You see I feel sad when you're sad,
I feel flare when you're flare
If you only knew what I'm going through,
I just can't smile without you.
You came along just like a song,
And right in my day, couldn't believe that you are part of a dream
Now it all seems like years away,
Now you know I can't smile without you,
I can't smile without you, 
I can't laugh and I can't sing, 
I find it is hard to do anything, 
'cause you see I feel sad when you're sad,
I feel flare when you're flare,
If you only knew what I'm going through,
I just can't smile..... 
Now some people say happiness takes so very longer fight,
Well, I find it is hard leaving your love behind.
