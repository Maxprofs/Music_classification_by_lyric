Title : Crazy Little Thing Called Love

This thing called love,
I just can't handle it.
This thing called love,
I must get round to it.
I ain't ready,
crazy little thing called love !

This thing (this thing)
called love (called love).
It cries (like a baby),
in a cradle all night.
It swings (woooh woooh),
it jives (woooh woooh).
It shakes all over like a jelly fish,
I kind of like it.
Crazy little thing called love !
There goes my baby,
she knows how to Rock'n'Roll.
She drives my crazy,
she gives me hot and cold fever.
Then she leaves me in a cool cool sweat.

I gotta be cool, relax, get hip !
Get on my track's,
take a back seat.
Hitch hike,
and take a long ride on my motor bike.
Until I'm ready,
crazy little thing called love.

I gotta be cool relax get hip !
Get on my track's,
take a back seat.
Hitch hike,
and take a long ride on my motor bike.
Until I'm ready (ready Freddie).
Crazy little thing called love !

This thing called love,
I just can't handle it.
This thing called love,
I must get round to it.
I ain't ready...
Crazy little thing called love...
Crazy little thing called love...
Crazy little thing called love...
Crazy little thing called love...
Crazy little thing called love...
