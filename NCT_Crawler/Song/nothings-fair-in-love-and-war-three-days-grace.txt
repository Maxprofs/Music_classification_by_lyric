                        Bài hát: Nothing's Fair In Love And War - Three Days Grace

I always shoot first
Never ask questions
Never feel the consequences
I didn't feel a thing
I didn't feel a thing
I never think twice
No intentions
Never feel the consequences
Until it starts to sting
Until it starts to sting
No!
Never hurt like this before
No!
Nothing's fair in love and war!

Turn out
The lights!
Nothing's fair in love and war!
It's too late
Tonight!
Nothing's fair in love and war!
You're in
My mind
Your heart
My knife
There's no wrong
Or right
Nothing's fair in love and war!

I never back down
Always in crisis
Left to my own devices
You never meant a thing
You never meant a thing
No!
It never hurt like this before
No!
Nothing's fair in love and war!

Turn out
The lights!
Nothing's fair in love and war!
It's too late
Tonight!
Nothing's fair in love and war!
You're in
My mind
Your heart
My knife
There's no wrong
Or right
Nothing's fair in love and war!

Turn out
The lights!
Nothing's fair in love and war!
It's too late
Tonight!
Nothing's fair in love and war!
You're in
My mind
Your heart
My knife
There's no wrong
Or right
Nothing's fair in love and war!
