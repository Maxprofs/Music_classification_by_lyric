                        I can feel it coming over me
I feel it all around me
I've been waiting for this moment all my life it's my destiny
There's a fire deep inside of me
it's waiting to come out now
no matter what, no matter how, I know I'll make it through somehow

cuz when the road feels too long
I'll still be holding on
I'm gonna keep on going, I know I'll be strong

Indestructible
I wont let nobody break me down
Indestructible
nothings gonna stop me now
Indestructible
gonna gonna make gonna keep on going
Indestructible
the last man standing

I'm ready for whatever
I'm never giving up
nothing can break my spirit
cuz it's indestructible

can't explain it, it's incredible
the strength I feel inside me
nothing is impossible
I know I'll find my way
through a storm through the darkest night
whatever comes it's alright
Not gonna turn around I'm ready, for the future now

and when the road feels too long
I'll still be holding on
I'm gonna keep on going, I know I'll be strong

nothing is impossible
if you really want it
and I really want it
not gonna stop, no matter what, no
yeah this time, nothing can hold me back, no
nothing can break me down, my spirit's indestructible.
