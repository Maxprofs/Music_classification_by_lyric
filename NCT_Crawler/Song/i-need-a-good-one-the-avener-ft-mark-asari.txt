[Intro]
Oh na na na na, yeah
Oh na na, na
Oh na na na na, yeah
Listen now

[Chorus]
I'm looking for my bride, on my ride, on my mind
Someone who's gonna cry for me, die for me, yeah
Sits with me at the table
'Cause I know she holdin' it down for a G
I got her, she got me
I need a good one

I need a good one
All I need is a good one
I don't think y'all hear me, all I'm needing is a good one
Who's holdin' it down for G
I got her, she got me, I need her

[Verse 1]
Somebody love you, I'm looking for you
Someone I can place no other girl above her
'Cause no one above her
I need a freak undercover
I wanna love you
Keeps me on point and she keepin' me focused
And wanna do better

[Pre-Chorus]
Just wanna know where she at
I'm looking for a real one that's got my back
Who keeps it 100
And all I need, all I need is just one
A good one

[Chorus]
I'm looking for my bride, on my ride, on my mind
Someone who's gonna cry for me, die for me, yeah
Sits with me at the table
'Cause I know she holdin' it down for a G
I got her, she got me
I need a good one

Oh na na na na
Oh na na, na
Oh na na na na, yeah
Listen now

[Verse 2]
I-I-I need her on my team
'Cause every solider needs a queen
She ain't in it for the money, she got her own money
Still imma make sure she's packing in the latest
You know [?]

[Chorus]
I'm looking for my bride, on my ride, on my mind
Someone who's gonna cry for me, die for me, yeah
Sits with me at the table
'Cause I know she holdin' it down for a G
I got her, she got me
I need a good one

Oh na na na na
Oh na na, na
Oh na na na na, yeah
Listen now

[Pre-Chorus]
I just wanna know where she at
I'm lookin' for a real one, that's got my back
Who keeps it 100
And all I need, all I need is just one
A good one

[Chorus]
I'm looking for my bride, on my ride, on my mind
Someone who's gonna cry for me, die for me, yeah
Sits with me at the table
'Cause I know she holdin' it down for a G
I got her, she got me
I need

I'm looking for my ride, on my pride, and my babe
Someone who's gonna ride, yeah
'Cause I know she holdin' it down for a G
I got her, she got me, ooh, oh

Oh na na na na
