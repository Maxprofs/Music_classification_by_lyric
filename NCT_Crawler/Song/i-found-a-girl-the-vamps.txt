                        Bài hát: I Found A Girl - The Vamps

This girl moved into my apartment (Monday)
One look at her my heart was stoping (heartbreak)
I did whatever she was asking
She said, maybe later catch you in the elevator
A couple days we got to hanging (real close)
Turns out she wasn’t even taken (oh no)
I made a move
She said baby you’re in mistaken
I’m not into bacon

She got that smile and that body is to die for
One of a kind
And that’s why it makes me cry

Cause I found a girl
Who’s’ in love with a girl
She said that she tried but she’s not into guys
Oh why tell me why
Did I fall for those eyes
She said I was nice
But she’s not into guys
I found a girl

I should’ve known to walk away then
I should’ve let it alone
But when she called me on the phone, we’d be hanging again
I knew the premise of friends
But now she only talks to me about some other women
She said

She got that smile and that body is to die for
One of a kind
And that’s why it makes me cry

Cause I found a girl
Who’s’ in love with a girl
She said that she tried but she’s not into guys
Oh why tell me why
Did I fall for those eyes
She said I was nice
But she’s not into guys
I found a girl

Oh oh oh oh oh
I found a girl
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh

I can’t believe I met somebody like you
And now I feel like a fool
And that to me is so cruel
I can’t believe it I just think like a man
That you just wanted me bad
But you had different plans

Cause I found a girl
Who’s’ in love with a girl
She said that she tried but she’s not into guys
Oh why tell me why
Did I fall for those eyes
She said I was nice
But she’s not into guys
I found a girl

Cause I found a girl
Who’s’ in love with a girl
She said that she tried but she’s not into guys
Oh why tell me why
Did I fall for those eyes
She said I was nice
But she’s not into guys
I found a girl
