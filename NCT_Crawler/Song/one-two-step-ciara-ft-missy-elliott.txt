Automatic supersonic hypnotic funky fresh,
Work my body so melodic,

Outrageous so contagious make you crave it,

Strut my stuff,
And yes I flaunt it,

It don't matter to me,
We can dance slow
(Ladies and gentlemen),
Whichever way the beats drop,
Our bodies will go
(I like this ah),
So swing it over here,

And we will, we will rock you up

And we will, we will rock you,
Lets shake

I shake it like jello,
And make the boys say hello,
Cause they know im rockin' the beat
(Rocking the beat),
I know you heard about a lot of great MC's,
But they ain't got nothing on me (nothing on me),
Because im 5 foot 2,
I wanna dance with you,
And im sophisticated fun,
I eat filet mignon,
And I'm nice and young,
Best believe im number one
(Whoa)

Rock it, don't stop it,
