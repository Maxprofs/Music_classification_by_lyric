                        Bài hát: El Condo Pasa - V.A

I'd rather be a sparrow than a snail. 
Yes I would, if I could. I surely would. Hmmm
I'd rather be a hammer than a nail. 
Yes I would, if I only could, I surely would. Hmm

Away I;d rather snail away. 
Like a swan that's here and gone.
A man gets tied up to the ground. 
He give the world it's sad-dest sound. It's sad-dest sound. Hmmm

I'd rather be a forest than s street. 
Yes I would, if I could, I surely would. Hmmm
I'd ra-ther feel the earth be-neath my feet. 
Yes I would, if I only could I surely would. Hmmm
