Cocaine
If you wanna hang out you've got to take her out;
cocaine.
If you wanna get down, down on the ground;
cocaine.
She don't lie, she don't lie, she don't lie;
cocaine.
When your day is done and you wanna run;
cocaine.
If you got bad news, you wanna kick them blues;
cocaine.
She don't lie, she don't lie, she don't lie;
cocaine.
If your thing is gone and you wanna ride on;
cocaine.
Don't forget this fact, you can't get it back;
cocaine.
She don't lie, she don't lie, she don't lie;
cocaine.
She don't lie, she don't lie, she don't lie;
cocaine.
