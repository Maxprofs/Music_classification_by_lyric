                        You're on the road
 But you've got no destination
 You're in the mud
 In the maze of her imagination
 You love this town
 Even if that doesn't ring true
 You've been all over
 And it's been all over you It's a beautiful day
 Don't let it get away
 It's a beautiful day Touch me
 Take me to that other place
 Teach me
 I know I'm not a hopeless case See the world in green and blue
 See China right in front of you
 See the canyons broken by cloud
 See the tuna fleets clearing the sea out See the bedouin fires at night
 See the oil fields at first light and
 See the bird with a leaf in her mouth
 After the flood all the colors came out It was a beautiful day
 Don't let it get away
 Beautiful day Touch me
 Take me to that other place
 Reach me
 I know I'm not a hopeless case What you don't have you don't need it now
 What you don't know you can feel it somehow
 What you don't have you don't need it now
 Don't need it now
 It was a beautiful day It was a beautiful day It was a beautiful day
 Don't let it get away
 Beautiful day
