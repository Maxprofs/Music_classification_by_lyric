                        Bài hát: I'm A Real American - Rick Derringer
Written by: Derringer, Rick, Kenny, Bernard

(I am a real American fight for the rights of every man
I'm a real American
Fight for what's right fight for your life)

When it comes crashing down and it hurts inside
You gotta take a stand
It don't hurt to hide
If you hurt my friends then you hurt my pride I gotta be a man I can't let it slide

I am a real American fight for the rights of every man
I'm a real American
Fight for what's right fight for your life

I feel strong about right and wrong
I don't take trouble for very long 
I've got something deep inside of me courage is the thing that sets us free

I am a real American fight for the rights of every man
I'm a real American
Fight for what's right fight for your life

I am a real American fight for the rights of every man
I'm a real American
Fight for what's right fight for your life

If you hurt my friends then you hurt my pride I gotta be a man I can't let
It slide

I am a real American fight for the rights of every man
I'm a real American
Fight for what's right fight for your life

I am a real American fight for the rights of every man
I'm a real American
Fight for what's right fight for your life

I am a real American fight for the rights of every man
I'm a real American
Fight for what's right fight for your life

I am a real American fight for the rights of every man
I'm a real American
Fight for what's right fight for your life
