                        Bài hát: Love (Ost What Happens In Vegas) - Matt White

And love .. 
Such a silly game we play, oh, 
Like a summers day in May. 
What is love, what is love? 
I just want it to be love 
oooh. oh 

I, I, I, I, I .. I can feel it in your kiss 
It just gives me tender bliss 
What is love, what is love? 
I just want it to be love 
oooh. oh. 

When I feel you around, 
I was mad as hell when I hit the ground. 
When I see you laugh away 
It hurts but I just won't say, 
uh uh uh. Loveee ... 

Who can tell me? I am lost. 
I just think that I am strong. 
What is love, what is love? 
I just want it to be love. 
ooooh ooh. 

When I feel you around, 
I was so upset we fell on the ground 
When I see you mad at me 
It was such a silly thing 
ooooooh 

And love .. 
Such a silly game we play, 
Like a summers day in May. 
What is love, what is love? 
I just want it to be love 
ooooh. oh 

and I, I, I, I, I, I can feel it in a kiss 
It is something I will miss 
What is love, what is love? 
I just want you to be love
                        
                    |
