                        Tomorrow
 Tomorrow never comes
 What kind of a fool
 Do they take me for?

 Tomorrow
 A resting place for bums
 A trap set in the slums
 But I know the score

 I won't take no for an answer
 I was born to be a dancer now, Yeah! 

 Tomorrow
 Tomorrow, as they say
 Another working day and another chore

 Tomorrow
 An awful price to pay
 I gave up yesterday
 But they still want more

 They are bound to compare me
 To Fred Astaire when I'm done

 Anyone who feels the rhythm
 Movin' through em
 Knows it's gonna do em good
 To let the music burst out
 When you feel assured

 Let the people know it
 Let your laughter loose
 Until your scream
 Becomes a love-shout, ah

 Tomorrow
 Tomorrow's far away
 Tomorrow, as they say, 
 Is reserved for dreams

 Tomorrow
 Tomorrow's looking grey
 A playground always locked
 Trains no winning teams

 Won't take no for an answer
 I was born to be a dancer now

 Anyone who feels the rhythm through em
 Knows it's gonna do em good
 To let the music burst out

 When you feel assured
 Let the people know it.
 Let your laughter loose
 Until your scream becomes a love shout
 Ah
                        
                    |
