                        Love has truly been good to me
 Not even one sad day
 Or minute have I had since you've come my way
 I hope you know I'd gladly go
 Anywhere you'd take me

 It's so amazing to be loved
 I'd follow you to the moon in the sky above
 Ooh... Ooh... Ooh... Ooh... Ooh... Ooh... Ooh... Ooh... I'd go

 Got to tell you how you thrill me
 I'm happy as I can be
 You have come and it's changed my whole world
 Bye-bye sadness, hello mellow
 What a wonderful day

 It's so amazing to be loved
 I'd follow you to the moon in the sky above
 Ooh... Ooh... Ooh... Ooh... Ooh... Ooh... Ooh... Ooh... I'd go

 And it's so amazing, amazing
 I could stay forever, forever
 Here in love and never leave ya never
 'Cause we've got amazing love

 Truly it's a amazing, amazing
 Love brought us together, together
 I will leave you never and never
 I guess we've got amazing love

 Ooh, so amazing and I've been waiting
 For a love like you

 It's so amazing to be loved
 I'd follow you to the moon in the sky above
 Oh, and it's so, it's so

 It's so amazing to be loved
 I'd follow you to the moon in the sky above
 And you know, it's so

 It's so amazing to be loved
 I'd follow you to the moon in the sky above
 Hey... Hey... Hey... Yeah... It's so

 It's so amazing to be loved
 I'd follow you to the moon in the sky above
 Hey... Hey... Yeah... Hey... Yeah... Yeah... Hey... It's so

 It's so amazing to be loved
 I'd follow you to the moon in the sky above
