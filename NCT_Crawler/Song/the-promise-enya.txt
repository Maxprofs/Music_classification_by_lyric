The promise

Sissi
If you
wait for me
then I'll
come for you
Although I have traveled far
I always hope a place for you in my heart
If you
think of me
If you miss me
once in a while
then I'll return to you
I'll return and fill that space in your heart
Remembering
Your touch
Your kiss
Your warm embrace
I'll find my way back to you
If you'll be waiting
If you
dream of me
like I dream of you
in a place that's warm and dark
in a place where I can feel the beating of your heart
Remembering
Your touch
Your kiss
Your warm embrace
I'll find my way back to you
If you'll be waiting
oh I've longed for you
and I have desired
to see your face your smile
to be with you wherever you are
Remembering
Your touch
Your kiss
Your warm embrace
I'll find my way back to you
Please say you'll be waiting
together again
It would feel so good to be
in your arms
Where all my journeys end
If you can make a promise
If it's one that you can keep
I vow to come for you
If you wait for me
And say you'll hold
a place for me
in your heart
a place for me in your heart
a place for me in your heart
                        
                    |
