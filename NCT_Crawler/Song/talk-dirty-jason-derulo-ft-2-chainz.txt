                        Bài hát: Talk Dirty - Jason Derulo, 2 Chainz

Jason
Jason Derulo
Get jazzy on it

[Jason Derulo:]
I'm that flight that you get on, international
First class seat on my lap girl, riding comfortable
Cause I know what the girl them need, New York to Haiti
I got lipstick stamps for my passport, make it hard to leave

[Jason Derulo:]
Been around the world, don't speak the language
But your booty don't need explaining
All I really need to understand is
When you talk dirty to me
Talk dirty to me
Talk dirty to me
Talk dirty to me
Get jazzy on it

[Jason Derulo:]
You know the words to my songs
No habla inglés
Our conversations ain't long
But you know what it is
I know what the girl them want, London to Taiwan
I got lipstick stamps for my passport
I think I need a new one

[Jason Derulo:]
Been around the world, don't speak the language
But your booty don't need explaining
All I really need to understand is
When you talk dirty to me
Talk dirty to me
Talk dirty to me
Talk dirty to me

[Jason Derulo:]
Uno, met a friend in Rio
Dos, she was all on me-o
Tres, we could ménage à three-o
Cuatro, ooh

[2 Chainz:]
Dos Cadenas, clothes are genius
Sold out arenas, you can suck my penis
Get with arenas, guns on deck
Chest to chest, tongue on neck
International oral sex
Every picture I take, I pose a threat
Boat or jet, what do you expect?
Her pussy so good I bought her a pet
Anyway, every day I'm trying to get to it
Got her saved in my phone under "Big Booty"
Anyway, every day I'm trying to get to it
Got her saved in my phone under "Big Booty"

[Jason Derulo:]
Been around the world, don't speak the language
But your booty don't need explaining
All I really need to understand is
When you talk dirty to me
Talk dirty to me
Talk dirty to me
Talk dirty to me
Get jazzy on it

What? I don't understand!
