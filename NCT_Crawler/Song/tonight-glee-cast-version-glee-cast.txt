                        Tonight
Tonight, tonight
It all began tonight
I saw you and the world went away

Tonight, tonight
There's only you tonight
What you are, what you do, what you say

Today, all day I had the feeling
A miracle would happen
I know now I was right

For here you are
And what was just a world is a star
Tonight

Tonight, tonight
The world is full of light
With suns and moons all over the place

Tonight, tonight
The world is wild and bright
Going mad
Shooting sparks into space

Today, the world was just an address
A place for me to live in
No better than all right

But here you are
And what was just a world is a star
Tonight

Good night, good night
Sleep well and when you dream
Dream of me
Tonight
