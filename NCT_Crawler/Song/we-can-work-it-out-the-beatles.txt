[ti:We Can Work It Out]
[al:Yesterday and Today]


Try to see it my way.
Do I have to keep on talking till I can't go on?
While you see it your way,
Run the risk of knowing that our love may soon be gone.
We Can Work It Out.
Think of what you're saying.
You can get it wrong and still you think that it's alright.
Think of what I'm saying,
We Can Work It Out and get it straight, or say good night.
Life is very short,
And there's no time,
For fussing and fighting, my friend.
I have always thought,
That it's a crime,
So I will ask you once again.
Only time will tell if I am right or I am wrong.
There's a chance that we may fall apart before too long.
