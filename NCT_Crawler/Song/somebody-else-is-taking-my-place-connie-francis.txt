                        Whoa-oh-oh,
 Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
 Whoa-oh-oh,
 Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
 In the lonely night,
 I wake up to find,
 Someone else's boy,
 Always on my mind,
 But he doesn't know,
 How much I really love him so.
 Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
 Though it isn't right,
 When I dream like this,
 I long to hold him tight,
 And to taste his kiss,
 And then I wake to find,
 He's someone else's boy,
 Not mi-i-i-i-ine.
 [Chorus:]
 Whenever I see them together,
 It breaks my poor heart in two,
 I know that I should forget him,
                        
                    |
