                        Bài hát: Đừng Hỏi Em (English Version) - Kyo York

Please dont ask me why
Our love was so bright
Dont blame me ask why
This dream has gone
Please dont ask me why
The day we first met

That passionate kiss
Has it com to this
We've been in love so long
We promised everything
How can I forget that letter on my bed
Your every written word

So painful in my heart
You left me alone
And just where'd you go
Please dont ask me now
How I'm feeling
Don't bring up the past

I have moved on
And please dont blame me
For bitter silence
When we are apart
What there left to love
The time just flies so fast

And you are in my past
I just cant believe
When I read what you wrote
Your every written word
So painful in my heart
You left me alone
And just where'd you go
                        
                    |
