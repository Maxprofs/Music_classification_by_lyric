                        Bài hát: Can't Take My Eyes Off You - Sofia Petersson

I need you baby. if its quite alright
I need you baby to warm my lonely nights
I love you baby. Trust in me when I say okay,(it's okay)
Oh pretty baby, don't let me down I pray
Oh pretty baby, now that I found you, stay
And let me love you
Oh baby let me love you. oh baby

You're just too good to be true.(true)
Can't take my eyes off of you.(you)
You'd be like heaven to touch.
I wanna hold you so much.(hold you so much)
At long last love has arrived.
And I thank God I'm alive.
You're just too good to be true.
Can't take my eyes off of you.

Pardon the way that I stare,(the way that i stare)
There's nothing else to compare
The sight of you leaves me weak
There are no words left to speak,(words left to speak)
But if you feel like I feel
Please let me know that it's real
You're just too good to be true
Can't take my eyes off of you
(Musical break)

I need you baby. if its quite alright
I need you baby to warm my lonely nights
I love you baby. Trust in me when I say okay, (it's okay)
Oh pretty baby, don't let me down I pray
Oh pretty baby, now that I found you, stay
And let me love you
Oh baby let me love you oh baby

(Key change)
You're just too good to be true
Can't take my eyes off of you
You'd be like heaven to touch
I wanna hold you so much, (hold you so much)
At long last love has arrived
And I thank God I'm alive
You're just too good to be true
Can't take my eyes off of you

(Musical break)

I need you baby, and if it's quite all right
I need you baby to warm the lonely night
I love you baby, trust in me when I say it's okay

Oh pretty baby, don't let me down I pray
Oh pretty baby, now that I found you, stay
And let me love you, oh baby let me love you oh baby

I need you baby, if it's quite alright
I love you baby, you warm the lonely nights
I need you baby, trust in me when I say it's okay
