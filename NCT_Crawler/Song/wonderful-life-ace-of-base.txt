                        1)
Here I go
Out to the sea again
The sunshine fills my hair
And dreams hang in the air

Gulls in the sky
And in my blue eyes
I know it feels unfair
There is magic everywhere

Pre-chorus:
Look at me standing here
Here on my own again
Up straight in the sunshine

Chorus:
No need to run and hide
It's a wonderful, wonderful life
No need to laugh and cry
It's a wonderful, wonderful life

2)
Sun's in your eyes
The heat is in your hair
They seem to hate you
Because you are there

And I need a friend
Oh, oh, I need a friend
To make me happy
I stand here on my own

(Pre-chorus & Chorus) 

I need a friend
Oh, I need a friend
To make me happy
Not so alone

(Pre-chorus & Chorus) 

(Chorus)

Ah ah ah ah ah ah (2x)
                        
                    |
