                        You look like you'd fit in the trunk of my car
 I might let you live, I might go too far
 I could wrap you up and take you home
 We'd be all alone Or should I let you be the one that got away?
 Knew it would happen but I didn't know it'd be today
 All the voices in my head always seem insane
 The one that got away, away, away, today Keep it down, don't talk, I have to think
 I could let you walk, I could feed the sink
 I could grind you up and disappear
 Like you were never here Should I let you be the one that got away?
 Knew it would happen but I didn't know it'd be today
 All the voices in my head always seem insane
 The one that got away Hi, I was just wondering
 If you could help me out?
 Um, my hands are full
 Could you just help me open the door to my van? Oh I'm sorry, you see I just broke my nail
 And I can't even hold my keys
 I gotta go, dumb psycho
 Hmm, must be your lucky day Or should I let you be the one that got away?
 Knew it would happen but I didn't know it'd be today
 All the voices in my head scream insane
 The one that got away You're the one that got away
 Ah, you're the one that got away
 The one that got away
 Away, away, away, away, away The one that got away
 Away, away, away, away, away
 The one that got away
 Away, away, away, away, away Hmm, maybe some other time
