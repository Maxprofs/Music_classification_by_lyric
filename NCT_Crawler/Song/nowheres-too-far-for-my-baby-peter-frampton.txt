                        I packed up my pony
 I loaded my Sony
 No one could see me for dust
 Im leaving my friends there
 Its not that I dont care
 I just need to chip off the rust I really belong here
 But something is wrong dear
 Im saying goodbye
 And its making me cry
 That I have to go Im crossing my fingers
 Im touching my toes
 Im hoping this feeling will go
 I know I can make it
 But will I mistake it
 When I can find peace of mind? Does it come in a letter
 To make you feel better
 Or do you apply
 To a name you come by?
 So you and I can begin Somebody tell me
 What am I doing here?
 Well, I could be happy
 Dont leave me alone
 Come with me now
 On my magical flyaway Journey through anywhere
 Choose a place here or there
 Nowheres too far for my baby
 Travel through time and space
 Dress you in mink and lace
 Nowheres too far for my baby Somebody tell me
 What am I doing here?
 Well, I could be happy
 Dont leave me alone
 Come with me now
 On my magical flyaway Journey through anywhere
 Choose a place here or there
 Nowheres too far for my baby
 Travel through time and space
 Dress you in mink and lace
 Nowheres too far for my baby Youd be my Guinevere
 Ill fight off any fear
 Nowheres too far for my baby
 Crossing my heart for you
 All that you want Ill do
 Nowheres too far for my baby
