Let me see you put your hearts up, yeah
If we give a little love, maybe we can change the world,

You think you're so small, like you're itty bitty,
Just one match in the lights of the city,
Walkin' by strangers on the side of the street,
Like a quarter in a cup'll get 'em up on their feet like,
You think you're never gonna make your mark,
Sit back and watch the world while it falls apart like,
Out of sight, out of mind like,
Like it's just a waste of time,
Like, like, like,

Hey yeah yeah yeah yeah
Hey yeah yeah,
If we give a little love,
Maybe we can change the world

Wish in a well, shooting star in the sky,
We can do anything if we try,
Cant resurrect Ghandi, Resurrect King,
But if we put our heads together we can do anything, like,
You don't have to be a billionare,
You don't have to have much to show how much you care like,
Give a wink, give a kiss, like,
Give a little happiness, like, like, like,

Hey yeah yeah yeah yeah
Hey yeah yeah,

If we give a little love,
Maybe we can change the world.
