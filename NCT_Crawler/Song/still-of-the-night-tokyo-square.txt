                        I hear the bells echoes only into the nite
Like the winds blowin’ softly to and fro
The moonlit nite reflects the stars above
Like fire flies in the sky what’s the use of being there alone.
When I was alone I didn’t really know
What I’ll find perhaps I was expectin’ you there
I wonder if I should be home or see what I would find
I think me being there somehow I’ll be used once more
Well it’s time for me to make up my mind before it’s too late
I wonder if I should be home or see what I would find
I think me being there somehow I’ll be used once more
Well it’s time for me To make up my mind before it’s too late
I wonder if I should be home or see what I would find
I think me being there somehow I’ll be used once more
Well it’s time for me To make up my mind before it’s too late

I hear the bells once more still it’s whisperin’ to and fro
It flows into the still of the nite
I wonder if I should be home or see what I would find
I think me being there somehow I’ll be used once more
Well it’s time for me to make up my mind before it’s too late
I wonder if I should be home or see what I would find
I think me being there somehow I’ll be used once more
Well it’s time for me to make up my mind before it’s too late
I wonder if I should be home or see what I would find
I think me being there somehow I’ll be used once more
Well it’s time for me to make up my mind before it’s too late
