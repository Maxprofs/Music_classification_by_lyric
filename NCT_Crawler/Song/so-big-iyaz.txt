Well it's done know it's ya boy IYAZ "J.R" Rotem
Now i wanna do it up (So Big)
Party it up (So Big)
spend it up (So Big)
So the whole world knows my love for you is(So Big)
My heart is (So Big)
My love is (So Big)
For you,for you

Now wit' a girl like u, nothing u can do
But give the whole world to her 24-7
When she looking so sweet that kind of body
You dont mind spending all of your time..time..time
And its not that you were asking me for nothing
I just wanna show you how deep my love is

cause with them girls before
i wasnt feeling so, Gone!
But wit' ya girl
i'm losing control..yo!

Now i wanna do it up (So Big)
Party it up (So Big)
Spend it up (So Big)
So the whole world knows my Love for you is(So Big)
My heart is (So Big)
My love is (So Big)
For you,for you

Now wit' a girl like you,
I don't care who,
Passes my way,
Rhianna or Beyonce,
Could holla at me,
It doesn't mean a thing,
Nothing compares to the joy you bring.

them girls can go,
i wasnt feel so calm
But wit' ya girl
i'm losing control..yo!

Now i wanna do it up (So Big)
Party it up (So Big)
spend it up (So Big)
So the whole world knows my love for you is (So Big)
My heart is (So Big)
My love is (So Big)
For you,for you
