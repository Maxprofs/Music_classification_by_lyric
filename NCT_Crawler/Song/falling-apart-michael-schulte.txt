                        Bài hát: Falling Apart - Michael Schulte

I am sleepless for a weekend
So I start to say goodbye
Say goodbye to all that he had
Say goodbye to what we lost

We don ́t talk
We ́re not enough and the storms slowly arrive
When the light turns and the cold times arise

We were running out
Through the storms, through the night
We were running in the dark, we were following our hearts
And we would fall down
And we would slowly fall apart
We would slowly fall into the dark

It is hard to let it all go
Let the past just disappear
Try to run time from an old life
But it always drags me down

We don ́t talk
We ́re not enough and the storm slowly arrive
When the light turns and the cold times arise

We were running out
Through the storms, through the night
We were running in the dark, we were following our hearts
And we would fall down
And we would slowly fall apart
We would slowly fall into the dark

We were running out
Through the storms, through the night
We were running in the dark, we were following our hearts
And we would fall down
And we would slowly fall apart
We would slowly fall into the dark

We were running out
Through the storms, through the night
We were running in the dark, we were following our hearts
And we would fall down
And we would slowly fall apart
We would slowly fall into the dark

And the cold times arise
And the cold times arise
                        
                    |
