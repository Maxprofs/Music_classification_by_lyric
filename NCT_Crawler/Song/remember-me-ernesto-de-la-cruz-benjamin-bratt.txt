                        Bài hát: Remember Me (Ernesto De La Cruz) - Benjamin Bratt

Remember me
Though I have to say goodbye
Remember me
Don't let it make you cry

For even if I'm far away
I hold you in my heart
I sing a secret song to you
Each night we are apart

Remember me
Though I have to travel far
Remember me
Each time you hear a sad guitar

Know that I'm with you
The only way that I can be
Until you're in my arms again
Remember me

(instrumental break)

Remember me
Though I have to say goodbye
Remember me
Don't let it make you cry


For even if I'm far away
I hold you in my heart
I sing a secret song to you
Each night we are apart

Remember me
Though I have to travel far
Remember me
Each time you hear a sad guitar

Know that I'm with you
The only way that I can be
Until you're in my arms again
Remember me
                        
                    |
