                        Bài hát: River (Acoustic Version) - Lights

Out across cities I see buildings turn into piles
And watch the world in wonder, as mountains turn into tiles
And trees loosing their leaves and their faces becoming tired
I wish i could discover something that doesn't expire
Come stumble me

Take me river, carry me far
Lead me river, like a mother
Take me over to some other unknown
Put me in the undertow

Such other things that make a kingdom rumble and shatter
The same dynamic that another day would never matter
It really just depends on who's giving and who's receiving
And things that don't make sense are always a little deceiving
Come and humble me

Take me river, carry me far
Lead me river, like a mother
Take me over to some other unknown
Put me in the undertow

I wanna go where you're going
A follower, following
Changing, but never changed
Claiming, but never claimed

Take me river, carry me far
Lead me river, like a mother
Take me over to some other unknown
Put me in the undertow

Take me river, carry me far
Lead me river, like a mother
Take me over to some other unknown
Put me in the undertow.
