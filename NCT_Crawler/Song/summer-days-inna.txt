                        Bài hát: Summer Days - Inna

Oh eh oh, oh eh oh, oh eh oh
Oh eh oh, oh eh oh, oh eh oh...
I'm gonna love you and maybe tonight
Take over the world
And be like Bonnie and Clyde
You know that I'm yours
I know that you're mine
We will stay together 'til the end of our time
Sweet summer days
Sweet summer days
Summer days, summer nights
We were crazy, we were wild
Turn your memories into a future
You can turn your memories into a future
Summer days, summer nights
We were crazy, we were wild
Turn your memories into a future
You can turn your memories into a future
Ma eh ah, ma eh ah, ma ma eh ah
Ma eh ah, ma ma eh ah...
I wanna love you and never let go
I'll give you my all and everybody will know
We travel the seas as long as you're mine
I'll hold on to you and everything will be fine
Sweet summer days
Sweet summer days
Summer days, summer nights
We were crazy, we were wild
Turn your memories into a future
You can turn your memories into a future
Summer days, summer nights
We were crazy, we were wild
Turn your memories into a future
You can turn your memories into a future
Ma eh ah, ma eh ah, ma ma eh ah
Ma eh ah, ma ma eh ah...
Oh eh oh, oh eh oh, oh eh oh
Oh eh oh, oh eh oh, oh eh oh...
Summer days, summer nights
We were crazy, we were wild
Turn your memories into a future
You can turn your memories into a future
Summer days, summer nights
We were crazy, we were wild
Turn your memories into a future
You can turn your memories into a future
