[Verse 1]
You make it look like it’s magic
Cause I see nobody, nobody but you, you, you
I'm never confused
Hey, hey
I'm so used to being used

[Pre-Hook]
So I love when you call unexpected
Cause I hate when the moment's expected
So I'ma care for you, you, you
I'ma care for you, you, you, you, yeah

[Hook]
Cause girl you're perfect
You're always worth it
And you deserve it
The way you work it
Cause girl you earned it
Girl you earned it

[Verse 2]
You know our love would be tragic
So you don't pay it, don't pay it no mind
We live with no lies
Hey, hey
You're my favorite kind of night

[Pre-Hook]
So I love when you call unexpected
Cause I hate when the moment's expected
So I'ma care for you, you, you
I'ma care for you, you, you, you, yeah

[Hook]
Cause girl you're perfect
You're always worth it
And you deserve it
The way you work it
Cause girl you earned it
Girl you earned it

[Verse 3]
On that lonely night
We said it wouldn't be love
But we felt the rush
It made us believe it was only us
Convinced we were broken inside, inside

[Hook]
Cause girl you're perfect
You're always worth it
And you deserve it
The way you work it
Cause girl you earned it
Girl you earned it
