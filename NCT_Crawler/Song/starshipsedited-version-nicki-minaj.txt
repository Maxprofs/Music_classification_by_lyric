 Let's go to the beach, each
 Let's go get away
 They say, what they gonna say?
 Have a drink, clink, found the bud light
 Bad bitches like me, is hard to come by
 The patron own, let's go get it on
 The zone own, yes, I'm in the zone
 Is it two, three? Leave a good tip
 I'ma blow off my money and don't give two shits

 I'm on the floor, floor
 I love to dance
 So give me more, more, 'till I can't stand
 Get on the floor, floor
 Like it's your last chance
 If you want more, more
 Then here I am

 Starships were meant to fly
 Hands up, and touch the sky
 Can't stop, 'cause we're so high
 Let's do this one more time

 Starships were meant to fly
 Hands up, and touch the sky
 Let's do this one last time
 Hands up... 

 (We're higher than a mother***er) (x3)

 Jump in my hoopty hoopty hoop, I own that
 And I ain't paying my rent this month, I owe that
 But *** who you want, and *** who you like
 Dance our life, there's no end in sight
 Twinkle, twinkle little star... 

 Now everybody let me hear you say ray-ray-ray
 Now spend all your money 'cause they pay-pay-pay
 And if you're a G, you a G-G-G
 My name is Onika, you can call me Nicki

 Get on the floor, floor
 Like it's your last chance
 If you want more, more
 Then here I am

 Starships were meant to fly
 Hands up, and touch the sky
 Can't stop, 'cause we're so high
 Let's do this one more time

 Starships were meant to fly
 Hands up, and touch the sky
 Let's do this one last time
 Can't stop... 

 (We're higher than a mother***er) (x3)

 Starships were meant to fly
 Hands up, and touch the sky
 Can't stop, 'cause we're so high
 Let's do this one more time

 Starships were meant to fly
 Hands up, and touch the sky
 Let's do this one last time
 Can't stop... 

 (We're higher than a mother***er) (x5)
