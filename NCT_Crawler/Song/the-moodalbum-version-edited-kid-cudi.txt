                        Yep
 Yep

 Shades over my eyes
 Make the creepers look back at themselves
 Sitting stuck in emotional bliss
 The skinny amount of girls with coke on their gums
 Tap my knee
 I'm keepin' the rythym
 The young and wild take chances together
 They all jump up, twist and groove
 But no one talks, lost in the motherfuckin' mood

 No one talks, lost in the mood
 No one talks, sweatin' it out, lost in the mood

 Hey, there's a hunger in the night
 The moonlight kissing the nips on the model frame
 I kissed her inner thigh
 Closed my eyes, she began to make me fit
 She like to go the mile, all the while
 I can see her tear bit
 I forgot her name

 Something that sounds like Penelope
 May be a French twang to it
 Tongue was quick, she was French I knew it
 A lovely foreigner, foreign to racism
 She like the young nigga by my brown skin
 My *** dog fro
 I'm king to her
 She will please her friend for me
 So funny and they'll starve in the garden
 Naked as always, honest
 Her hands all over my privates
 Lost in the mood

 No one talks, lost in the mood
 No one talks, sweatin' it out, lost in the mood

 But no one talks, lost in the motherfuckin' mood
 No one talks, lost in the mood
 No one talks, sweatin' it out, lost in the mood
