                        Once I had a love and it was a gas,
Soon turned out had a heart of glass. 
Seemed like the real thing, only to find.
Mucho mistrust. Love's gone behind

Once I had a love and it was divine.
Soon found out. How to lose my mind
It seemed like the real thing, but I was so blind
Mucho mistrust. Love's gone behind

In between "what I find is pleasing" and "I'm feeling fine",
love is so confusing
There's no peace of mind. 
If I fear I'm losing you,It's just not good.
You teasing like you do.

Lost inside, adorable illusion and I cannot hide.

We could’ve made it cruising, yeah.
