[ar:Eminem]
[al:The Marshall Mathers]
When I was just a little baby boy
My mamma used to tell me these crazy things
She used to tell me my daddy was an evil man
She used to tell me he hated me
But then I got a little bit older and I realized she was the
crazy one
And there was nothing I could do or say to change her
Cause that's just the way she was
They said I can't rap about being broke no more
They didn't say I can't rap about coke no more
(Ahh)
Slut, you think I won't choke no ***
Till her vocal cords don't work in her throat no more
(Ahh)
These mother***ers are thinking I'm playin'
Thinking I'm sayin' this *** 'cause I'm thinkin' it
Just to be sayin' it
(Ahh)
Put your hands down bitch I ain't gon' shoot you
I'mma pull you to this bullet and put it through you
(Ahh)
Shut up, slut you're causing too much chaos
Just bend over and take it like a slut, ok ma
Oh, now he's raping his own mother, abusing her
Worse snortin' coke, and we gave him the Rolling Stone cover?
You're *** right bitch, and now it's too late
I'm triple-platnum and tragedies happened in two states
I invented violence you vile, venomous, vomital bitches
Vain, vicadin, vrin-vrin-vrin
Touch this chainsaw, left his brains all
Dangling from his neck while his head barely hangs on
Blood, guts, guns, cuts
Knives, lives, wives, nuns, sluts
Bitch, I'mma kill you
You don't wanna *** with me
Girls leave, you ain't nothin' but a slut to me
Bitch, I'mma kill you
You don't got the balls to beef
We ain't gon' never stop beefin'
I don't squash the beef
You better kill me
I'mma be another rapper dead
For poppin' off at the mouth with *** I shouldn't have said
But when they kill me
I'm bringin' the world with me
Bitches too, you ain't nothin' but a girl to me
I said you don't wanna *** with Shady
(Cause why?)
Cause Shady will ***in' kill you
(Ha-ha)
You don't wanna *** with Shady
(Why?)
Cause Shady will ***in' kill you
Bitch, I'mma kill you
Like a murder weapon I'mma conceal you
In a closet with mildew, sheets, pillows & film you
*** with me, I've been through hell, shut the hell up
I'm try-na to develop these pictures of the devil to sell them
I ain't Acid Rap but I rap on acid
Got a new blow torch and just had a strap-on added
Woops, is that a subliminal hint? No!
It's criminal intent, to sodomize women again
Eminem offend? No, Eminem'll assault
And if you ever give it to him you'll give him an impulse
To do it again, then if he does it again
You probabaly end up jumping out of something up in the tents
Bitch, I'mma kill you
I ain't done, this ain't the chorus
I ain't even drug you in the woods yet to paint the forest
A bloodstain is orange after you wash it three or four times
In a tub but that's normal ain't it Norman?
Serial killer hiding murder material
In a cereal box on top of your stereo
Here we go again, we're out of out medicine
Out of our minds, and we want in yours
Let us in
Or I'mma kill you
You don't wanna *** with me
Girls leave, you ain't nothin' but a slut to me
Bitch, I'mma kill you
You don't got the balls to beef
We ain't gon' never stop beefin'
I don't squash the beef
You better kill me
I'mma be another rapper dead
For poppin' off at the mouth with *** I shouldn't have said
But when they kill me
I'm bringin' the world with me
Bitches too, you ain't nothin' but a girl to me
I said you don't wanna *** with Shady
(Cause why?)
Cause Shady will ***in' kill you
(Ha-ha)
You don't wanna *** with Shady
(Why?)
Cause Shady will ***in' kill you
He-heh
Know why I say these things
Cause ladies screams be creepin' in Shady's dreams
And the way things seem, I shouldn't have to pay these shrinks
These eighty g's so he can say the same things tweece
Twice, whatever, I hate these things
*** shots, I hope this weed'll outweigh these drinks
Mother***ers want me to come on their radio shows
Just to argue with them 'cause their ratings stink?
*** that, I'll choke radio announcer to bouncer
From that bitch to all seventy thousand pounds of her
From the princapal to student body and counseler
From in school to before school to outta school
I don't even believe in breathin'
I'm leavin' air in your lungs so you can keep screamin'
For me to seep it
Okay, I'm ready to go play
I got the machette from OJ
I'm ready to make everyone's throats ache
You faggots keep egging me on
Till I have you at knife point then you beg me to stop?
Shut up, give me your hands and feet
I said shut up when I'm talking to you
You hear me? Answer me
Or I'mma kill you
You don't wanna *** with me
Girls leave, you ain't nothin' but a slut to me
Bitch, I'mma kill you
You don't got the balls to beef
We ain't gon' never stop beefin'
I don't squash the beef
You better kill me
I'mma be another rapper dead
For poppin' off at the mouth with *** I shouldn't have said
But when they kill me
I'm bringin' the world with me
Bitches too, you ain't nothin' but a girl to me
I said you don't wanna *** with Shady
(Cause why?)
Cause Shady will ***in' kill you
(Ha-ha)
You don't wanna *** with Shady
(Why not?)
Cause Shady will ***in' kill you
Ha-ha-ha!
I'm just playin' ladies
You know I love you
