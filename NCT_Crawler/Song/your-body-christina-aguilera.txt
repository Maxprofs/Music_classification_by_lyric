                        Song: Your Body - Christina Aguilera

Came here tonight to get you out of my mind,
I'm gonna take what I find. (uh oh, yeah)
So open the box, don't need no key I'm unlocked.
And I won't tell you to stop. (uh oh, yeah)

(Hey boy)
I don't need to know where you've been,
All I need to know is you and no need for talking.(hey boy)
So don't even tell me your name,
All I need to Know is whose place,
And let's get walkin'.

All I wanna do is your body.
Ooooh oooh oooh oooh.
Tonight's your lucky night, I know you want it.
Ooooh oooh oooh oooh.

All I wanna do is your body.
Ooooh oooh oooh oooh.
Tonight's your lucky night, I know you want it.
Ooooh oooh oooh oooh.

It's true what you heard, I am a freak, I'm disturbed.
So come on and give me your worst. (uh oh, yeah)
We're moving faster than slow,
If you don't know where to go,
I'll finish off on my own. (uh oh, yeah)
