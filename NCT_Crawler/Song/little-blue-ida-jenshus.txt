                        I can't keep you
 I know they think it's wrong
 I can't hold you
 My arms are not that long

 See the star
 That shines tonight for you
 I'm gonna keep you in my heart
 My little blue
 My little blue

 Ref.
 There's a place that I know
 Where you and I sometimes go
 You pick flowers
 And I watch you grow
 You got those eyes
 Just like her when she smiles
 They're nothing but blue
 Just like yours

 I see heroes
 I see that burning light
 I feel you slippin'
 Still I wanna hold you tight

 They say I chose
 I chose the easy way
 But the hardest thing I've done
 Is leaving you today
 My little blue

 Ref.
 There's a place that I know
 Where you and I sometimes go
 You pick flowers
 And I watch you grow
 You got those eyes
 Just like her when she smiles
 They're nothing but blue
 Just like yours

 I can't keep you
 I know they think it's wrong
 I can't hold you
 My arms are not that long
                        
                    |
