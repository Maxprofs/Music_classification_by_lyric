                        She packed my bags last night, pre-flight
 Zero hour nine a.m.
 And Im gonna be high as a kite by then
 I miss the earth so much, I miss my wife
 Its lonely out in space, on such a timeless flight And I think, its gonna be a long, long time
 Till touch down brings me 'round again to find
 Im not the man they think I am at home
 Oh, Im a rocket man
 Rocket man, I'm burning out of fuse up here alone And I think, its gonna be a long, long time
 Till touch down brings me 'round again to find
 Im not the man they think I am at home
 Oh, Im a rocket man
 Rocket man, I'm burning out of fuse up here alone Mars aint the kind of place to raise your kids
 In fact its cold as hell
 And theres no one there to raise them if you did
 And all this science, I dont understand
 Its just my job five days a week, a rocket man, oh rocket man And I think, its gonna be a long, long time
 Till touch down brings me 'round again to find
 Im not the man they think I am at home
 Oh no, Im a rocket man
 Rocket man, I'm burning out of fuse up here alone And I think, its gonna be a long, long time
 Till touch down brings me 'round again to find
 Im not the man they think I am at home
 Oh no, Im a rocket man
 Rocket man, I'm burning out of fuse up here alone And I think, its gonna be a long, long time
 Its gonna be a long, long time
 I think, its gonna be a long, long time
 Its gonna be a long, long time, oh Long, long time, gonna be a long, long time
 Its gonna be a long, long time
 Gonna be a long, long time
 Oh, I think, its gonna be a long, long time, oh yeah
