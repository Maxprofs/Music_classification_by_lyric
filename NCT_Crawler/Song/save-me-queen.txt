[ar:Queen]
[al:Queen The Platinum Collection - Disc 1]
[offset:500]
It started off so well
They said we made a perfect pair
I clothed myself in your glory and your love
How I loved you
How I cried
The years of care and loyalty
Were nothing but a sham it seems
The years belie we lived the lie
"I love you 'til I die"

Save me, Save me, Save me
I can't face this life alone
Save me Save me Save me
I'm naked and I'm far from home

The slate will soon be clean
I'll erase the memories
To start again with somebody new
Was it all wasted
All that love ?
I hang my head and I advertise
A soul for sale or rent
I have no heart, I'm cold inside
I have no real intent

Save me, Save me, Save me
I can't face this life alone
Save me Save me
Oh I'm naked and I'm far from home

Each night I cry and still believe the lie
I love you 'til I die

(Save me, Save me, Save me)
Yea, yeah
Save me yeah Save me oh Save me
Don't let me face my life alone
Save me, Save me
Oh I'm naked and I'm far from home
