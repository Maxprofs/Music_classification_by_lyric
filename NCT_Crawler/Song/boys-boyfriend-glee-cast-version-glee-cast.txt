                        Bài hát: Boys - Boyfriend (Glee Cast Version) - Glee Cast

[Artie: (Speaking)]
For whatever reason,
I feel like I've been wanting you all my life
You don't understand,
I'm so glad we're at the same place at the same time

[Blaine: (Speaking)]
It's over now
I spotted you dancing,
You made all the boys stare,
Those lips and your brown eyes,
And the sexy hair

[Artie: (Speaking)]
I should shake my thing,
I make the world want you,
Tell your girls you'll be back,
I wanna see what you can do

[Blaine and Artie:]
What would it take for you to just leave with me,
Not trynna sound conceited, 
Me and you were meant to be
You're a sexy girl,
I'm a nice guy,
Let's turn this dance floor into our own little nasty world,

[Blaine (Artie):]
If I was your boyfriend, (Sometimes a girl just needs one)
Keep you on my arm girl (To love her and to hold)
I can be a gentleman (And when a girl is with one)
If I was your boyfriend (Then she's in control)
If I was your boyfriend

[Artie:]
Tell me what you like,
Yeah tell me what you don't,
I can be your Buzz Lightyear,
Fly across the globe
I don't ever want to fight,
Yeah you already know,
Imma make you shine bright,
Like you layin' in the snow, burr

[Blaine:]
Girlfriend, girlfriend,
You could be my girlfriend,
You could be my girlfriend,
Until the w-world ends,
Make you dance, do a spin,
And a twirl and voice going crazy on this hook like a whirl wind,
Swaggie

[Blaine (Artie):]
If I was your boyfriend, (Sometimes a girl just needs one)
Keep you on my arm girl (To love her and to hold)
I can be a gentleman (And when a girl is with one)
If I was your boyfriend (Then she's in control)
If I was your boyfriend

[Blaine:]
So give me a chance,
Cause you're all I need girl,

[Artie:]
Spend a week with your boy, 
I'll be callin' you my girlfriend
If I was your man, 
I'd never leave you girl,
I just want to love and treat you right

[Blaine (Artie):]
If I was your boyfriend, (Sometimes a girl just needs one)
Keep you on my arm girl (To love her and to hold)
I can be a gentleman (And when a girl is with one)
If I was your boyfriend (Then she's in control)
If I was your boyfriend

[Blaine and Artie:]
Na,na,na,na,na,na,na,na,na (Yeah Girl)
Na,na,na,na,na,na
Yeah if I was your boyfriend,
Na,na,na,na,na,na,na,na,na
Aye
Na,na,na,na,na,na
If I was your boyfriend

[Blaine: (Speaking)]
Can't live with em'

[Artie: (Speaking)]
Can't live without em'
                        
                    |
