[00:-2.00]Avril Lavigne - Stop Standing There
[00:-1.00]

All this talkin' to you
I don't know what I'm to do
I don't know where you stand
What's inside of your head
All this thinkin' of you
Is that what you're doing too?
You're always on my mind
I talk about you all of the time

Don't waste another day
Don't waste another minute
I can't wait to see your face
Just to show you how much I'm in it

So open up your heart
Help me understand
Please tell me who you are
So I can show you who I am

You're just standin' by
You're just wastin' time
Why don't you just tell me the truth
About me and you
And as the time goes by
I hope you realize
If you ask me to,
I just might be with you

So don't waste another day
Don't waste another minute
I can't wait to see your face
Just to show you how much I'm in it

Open up your heart
Help me understand
Please tell me who you are
So I can show you who I am

Stop standin' there
Standin' there
And stop actin' like you don't care
Stop being scared, being scared
Stop actin' like you don't care

So don't waste another day
Don't waste another minute
I can't wait to see your face
Just to show you how much I'm in it

Open up your heart
Help me understand
Please tell me who you are
So I can show you who I am
So don't waste another day
Don't waste another minute
I can't wait to see your face
Just to show you how much I'm in it

Open up your heart
Help me understand
Please tell me who you are
So I can show you who I am
Who I am
Who I am
Who I am

The End
