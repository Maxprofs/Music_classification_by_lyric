                        I gotta gotta fly
With my head and my hands up high
I go by my own to the place that shine then I
Walk straight to the place of my desire
And prove that im my life’s own rider

I keep run to a place where lights dont fade
Where they know what to say
Where they know how to say
Just so that i go
My heart still knows
My mind says go tho' my body says no
But i gatta go my own thing in my own time
Gatta make the right thing from the wrong time
So i know - let it all go
bend my brows
staring at the window
I feel so cold When you flow on the rove
Aint know where to go this is time to go
And can you tell me what what is wrong with my mind
Tell me why i mind bout the lies
Tell me somethin i aint know and can you
Tell me tell me that i can stand up and go

I gotta gotta fly
With my head and my hands up high
I go by my own to the place that shine then I
Walk straight to the place of my desire
And prove that im my life’s own rider

As I young Vietnamese I do believe
Traditional of family is the key
It's sth real, its sth true
It's sth 4 me who tryda move on
A tons of hold back clog me up
But the will in my mind will never stop
I keep try it on, on and off
and sth i create along never get exhausted
I think it's time to take a rest
I dont wanna see my face turnin pale
I dont want my life turnin harsh around
I get on my feet start to walk my way
My way, For my dad's sweater
my mom's shelter
my sister's worries for my departed friend
And make sure bad stuff aint happen again

I gotta gotta fly
With my head and my hands up high
I go by my own to the place that shine then I
Walk straight to the place of my desire
And prove that im my life’s own rider


Take a look back at the years i had
19 here i go im still on my track
These shoes i buy these bills i pay with eveything i say today
gatta make it better everytime i step on the stage hold my mic gatta do it fo life
i gatta make it better everythin ive got, that's me inside dont ever wonder why
The sky, it's high, it's bright for a while, then it fades, i stay, i only stay and pray.
Lucky me I've got this beautiful red heart in my chest from my mom, from my dad, from their blood, from their heart From their love
Lucky me I've got this four leaf clover.
Look at me, I can tie my own shoes, sober
So look at me I've got my time ahead
Ima strew my own carpet, it's never be a test for you all who never try
And time is gettin by, and when you realize, it's never a chance to shine you could lie down and cry
Thats when i stay shine cuz of my brave heart that i try
And yea we stay fly
