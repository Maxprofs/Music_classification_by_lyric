                        I've been waiting, pacing along the halls ever since you left here
 I've been cleaning, scrubbing the plates and weeding out the garden dear
 I can't fall asleep to your mystery slowly blowing from the shore
 I have not failed to be what you'd expect of me
 Swallowing glass just to stay pure

 All the birds are heading down south but you're staying up north you say
 I've got jackets blankets and sheets, it's going to be a cold december

 It could be warm you see, a statue next to me
 Swimming away from the ice and snow
 Could I have failed to see the signs in front of me
 Warning and flashing symbols, subtle and simple I couldn't see
 I couldnt see

 If only time could slow down, maybe I could come up
 It's such a cold december
 It's such a cold december
 Its so cold

 I can't fall asleep to your mystery slowly blowing from the shore
 I have not failed to be what you'd expect of me
 Swallowing glass just to stay pure

 Summers come and summer has gone
 Your christmas cards can't comfort me
 You've found new friends and tied all the ends
 It's freezing in the loneliest winter

 It could be warm you see, a statue next to me
 Swimming away from the ice and snow
 Could I have failed to see the signs in front of me
 Warning and flashing symbols, subtle and simple I couldnt see
 I couldnt see

 If only time could slow down, then maybe I could come up
 It's such a cold december
 It's such a cold december
 It's so cold
