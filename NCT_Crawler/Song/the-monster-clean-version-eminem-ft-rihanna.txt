                        Bài hát: The Monster - Eminem, Rihanna 

[Hook: Rihanna] 
I'm friends with the monster that's under my bed 
Get along with the voices inside of my head 
You're trying to save me, stop holding your breath 
And you think I'm crazy, yeah, you think I'm crazy 

[Verse 1: Eminem] 
I wanted the fame, but not the cover of Newsweek 
Oh well, guess beggars can't be choosey 
Wanted to receive attention for my music 
Wanted to be left alone in public, excuse me 
Been wanting my cake, and eat it too, and wanting it both ways 
Fame made me a balloon cause my ego inflated 
When I blew; see, it was confusing 
Cause all I wanted to do is be the Bruce Lee of loose leaf 
Abused ink, used it as a tool when I blew steam (wooh!) 
Hit the lottery, oh wee 
With what I gave up to get was bittersweet 
With this like winning a huge meet 
Ironic cause I think I'm getting so huge I need a shrink 
I'm beginning to lose sleep: one sheep, two sheep 
Going cuckoo and cooky as Kool Keith 
But I'm actually weirder than you think 
Cause I'm 

[Hook] 

[Bridge: Rihanna] 
Well, that's nothing 
Well, that's nothing 

[Verse 2: Eminem] 
No, I ain't much of a poet but I know somebody once told me 
To seize the moment and don't squander it 
Cause you never know when it all could be over tomorrow 
So I keep conjuring, sometimes I wonder where these thoughts spawn from 
(Yeah, ponder it, do you want this? 
No wonder you losing your mind, the way it wanders) 
Yo-lo-lo-lo-yee-whoo 
I think you've been wandering off down yonder 
And stumbled onto Jeff VanVonderen 
Cause I need an interventionist 
To intervene between me and this monster 
And save me from myself and all this conflict 
Cause the very thing that I love is killing me and I can't conquer it 
My OCD is conking me in the head 
Keep knocking, nobody's home, I'm sleepwalking 
I'm just relaying what the voice in my head's saying 
Don't shoot the messenger, I'm just friends with the 

[Hook + Bridge] 

[Verse 3: Eminem] 
Call me crazy, but I have this vision 
One day that I walk amongst you a regular civilian 
But until then drums get killed and I'm coming straight at 
Emcees, blood get spilled and I 
Take it back to the days that I get on a Dre track 
Give every kid who got played at 
Pumped up feeling and *** to say back 
To the kids who played 'em 
I ain't here to save the *** children 
But if one kid out of a hundred million 
Who are going through a struggle feels and then relates that's great 
It's payback, Russell Wilson falling way back 
In the draft, turn nothing into something, still can make that 
Straw into gold chump, I will spin Rumpelstiltskin in a haystack 
Maybe I need a straight jacket, face facts 
I am nuts for real, but I'm okay with that 
It's nothing, I'm still friends with the
