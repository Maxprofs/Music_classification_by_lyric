                        Bài hát: Life Is Worth Living - Justin Bieber

 [ verse 1]:
Ended up on a crossroad
Tried to figure out which way to go
It's like you're stuck on a treadmill
Running in the same place
You got your hazard lights on now 
Hoping that somebody would slow down 
Praying for a miracle
Who'll show your grace
Had a couple dollars and a quarter tank of gas
With a long journey ahead
Seen a truck pull over
God sent an angel to help you out
He gave you direction
Showed you how to read a map
For the long journey ahead
Said it ain't ever over
Oh, even in the midst of doubt

 [ chorus ]:
Life is worth living 
Life is worth living, so live another day
The meaning of forgiveness 
People make mistakes, doesn't mean you have to give in 
Life is worth living again

 [ verse ]:
Relationship on a ski slope
Avalanche comin' down slow
Do we have enough time to salvage this love?
Feels like a blizzard in the April
'Cause my heart, it's just like cold
Skating on thin ice
But it's strong enough to hold us up
Seen her scream and holler
Put us both on blast
Tearing each other down
When I thought it was over
God sent us an angel to help us out
He gave us direction
Showed us how to make it last
For that long journey ahead
Said it ain't ever over
No, even in the midst of doubt

 [ chorus ]:
Life is worth living 
Life is worth living, so live another day
The meaning of forgiveness 
People make mistakes, doesn't mean you have to give in 
Life is worth living again
Life is worth living again

 [ bridge ]:
What I get from my reflection
is a different in perception
From what the world may see
They tried to crucify me
I ain't perfect, won't deny
My reputation's on the line
So I'm working on a better me

 [ chorus ]:
Life is worth living 
Life is worth living, so live another day
The meaning of forgiveness 
People make mistakes, only God can judge me
Life is worth living again
Another day
Life is worth living again.
