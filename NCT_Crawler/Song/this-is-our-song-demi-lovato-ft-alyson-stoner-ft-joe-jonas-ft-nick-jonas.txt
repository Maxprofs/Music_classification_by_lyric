                        So let's sing
Na, na na na na, hey, ya
Come on and sing
Na, na na na na, hey, ya

This is our song
That's all that matters
'Cause we all belong right here together
There's nothing better than singing along
This is our summer
This is our song

And grab your guitar
Sit by the fire
'Cause we all need a song
When we all tired
We'll sit here together
And sing it outloud

This is our song
That's all that matters
'Cause we all belong right here together
There's nothing better than singing along
This is our summer
And this is our song
This is our song
This is our song
This is our song

Come on and sing
Na, na na na na, hey, ya
Come on and sing
Na, na na na na, hey, ya
And come on and sing
Na, na na na na, hey, ya
Come on and sing
Na, na na na na, hey, ya

This is our song
That's all that matters
'Cause we all belong right here together
There's nothing better than singing along
This is our summer
(Our summer)

This is our song
That's all that matters
'Cause we all belong right here together
There's nothing better than singing along
This is our summer
This is our song
(This is our song)
This is our song
(This is our song)
This is our song
