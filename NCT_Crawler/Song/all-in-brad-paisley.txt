                        My father fought a fires like his father before him
 I'm from a long line of those that go all in
 Yeah, I can still remember when that siren would scream
 They'd be out the door and flyin right to the scene
 Without hesitation and the face of fear and doubt
 Every fighter long that draft about to burn down
 There's smoke and flames and everybody needs out
 They're all in
 So baby if you wondering how I'm going to be
 When life lines up all around you and me
 I'aint going nowhere
 I won't fight for us
 Suit me up
 Send me in
 I live with that rush
 Without hesitation and the face of fear and doubt
 Every fighter long that draft about to burn down
 There's smoke and flames and everybody else is getting out
 I'm all in
 Listen to me now
 And so when everything is coming down around you
 Ooo... 
 I ain't going anywhere
 This is what I do
 So tonight in every city
 Every little town
 Were living full moment when that whistle sounds
 Next time you see a burning building
 Scorching up the night
 Just be glad your out now
 Imagine going inside
 Without hesitation and the face of fear and doubt
 Every fighter long that draft about to burn down
 There's smoke and flames and everybody needs out
 I'm all in
 Ooo... 
 Without hesitation and the face of fear and doubt
 Every fighter long that draft about to burn down
 There's smoke and flames and everybody needs out
 I'm all in
                        
                    |
