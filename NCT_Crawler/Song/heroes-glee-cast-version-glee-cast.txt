                        Bài hát: Heroes (Glee Cast Version) - Glee Cast

[Sam:]
I, I wish I could swim
Like the dolphins, like dolphins can swim
Though nothing, nothing will keep us together
We can beat them, for ever and ever
Oh we can be Heroes, just for one day

[Blaine:]
I, I will be king
And you, you will be queen
Though nothing will drive them away
We can be Heroes, just for one day

[Sam and Blaine:]
We can be us, just for one day

[Sam:]
I, I can remember ([Blaine:] I remember)
Standing, by the wall ([Blaine:] by the wall)
And the guns shot above our heads ([Blaine:] over our heads)
And we kissed, as though, nothing could fall ([Blaine:] nothing could fall)

[Blaine and Sam:]
And the shame was on the other side
Oh we can beat them, for ever and ever
Then we could be Heroes,
just for one day
We can be Heroes
We can be Heroes
We can be Heroes
Just for one day
                        
                    |
