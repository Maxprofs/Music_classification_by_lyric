                        Bài hát: Alone (DJ Trung Hiếu Remix) - Alan Walker, DJ

[Verse 1] 
Lost in your mind 
I wanna know 
Am I losing my mind? 
Never let me go 

[Chorus] 
If this night is not forever 
At least we are together 
I know I'm not alone 
I know I'm not alone 
Anywhere, whenever 
Apart, but still together 
I know I'm not alone 
I know I'm not alone 

[Post-Chorus] 
I know I'm not alone 
I know I'm not alone 

[Verse 2] 
Unconscious mind 
I'm wide awake 
Wanna feel one last time 
Take my pain away 

[Chorus] 
If this night is not forever 
At least we are together 
I know I'm not alone 
I know I'm not alone 
Anywhere, whenever 
Apart, but still together 
I know I'm not alone 
I know I'm not alone 

[Post-Chorus] 
I know I'm not alone 
I know I'm not alone 
I'm not alone, I'm not alone 
I'm not alone, I know I'm not alone 
I'm not alone, I'm not alone 
I'm not alone, I know I'm not alone
                        
                    |
