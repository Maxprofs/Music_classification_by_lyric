                        Bài hát: Heartbeat Song - Kelly Clarkson

This is my heartbeat song and I'm gonna play it
Been so long I forgot how to turn it
Up up up up all night long
Oh up up all night long

You, where the hell did you come from?
You're a different, different kind of fun
And I'm so used to feeling numb
Now, I got pins and needles on my tongue
Anticipating what's to come
Like a finger on a loaded gun

I can feel it rising
Temperature inside me
Haven't felt it for a long time

This is my heartbeat song and I'm gonna play it
Been so long I forgot how to turn it
Up up up up all night long
Oh up up all night long

This is my heartbeat song and I'm gonna play it
Turned it on but I know you can take it
Up up up up all night long
Oh up up all night long
(all night long)

I, I wasn't even gonna go out
But I never would have had a doubt
If I had known where I'd be now

Your hands on my hips
And my kiss on your lips
I could do this for a long time

This is my heartbeat song and I'm gonna play it
Been so long I forgot how to turn it
Up up up up all night long
Oh up up all night long

This is my heartbeat song and I'm gonna play it
Turned it on but I know you can take it
Up up up up all night long
Oh up up all night long

Until tonight I only dreamed about you
I can't believe I ever breathed without you
Baby you make me feel alive and brand new
Bring it one more time (one more time)

This is my heartbeat song and I'm gonna play it (oh)
Been so long I forgot how to turn it (oh)
Up up up up all night long
Oh up up all night long (yeah)

This is my heartbeat song and I'm gonna play it (oh)
Turned it on but I know you can take it (oh)
Up up up up all night long
Oh up up all night long
(all night long)

This is my heartbeat song and I'm gonna play it
Been so long I forgot how to turn it
Up up up up all night long
Oh up up all night long

This is my heartbeat song and I'm gonna play it
Turned it on but I know you can take it
Up up up up all night long
Oh up up all night long
