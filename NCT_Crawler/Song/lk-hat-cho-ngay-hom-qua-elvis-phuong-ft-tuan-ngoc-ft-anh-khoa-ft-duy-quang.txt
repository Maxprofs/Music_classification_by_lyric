                        Bài hát: Lk Hát Cho Ngày Hôm Qua - Elvis Phương, Tuấn Ngọc, Anh Khoa, Duy Quang

Yesterday,
All my troubles seemed so far away,
Now it looks as though they're here to stay,
Oh, I believe in yesterday.
Suddenly,
I'm not half the man I used to be,
There's a shadow hanging over me,
Oh, yesterday came suddenly.
Why she
Had to go I don't know, she wouldn't say.
I said,
Something wrong, now I long for yesterday. 

Yesterday, when I was young
The taste of life was sweet, as rain upon my tongue
I teased at life, as if it were a foolish game
The way the evening breeze may tease a candle flame
The thousand dreams I dreamed, the splendid things I planned,
I always built, alas, on weak and shifting sand,
I lived by night, and shunned the naked light of day
And only now, I see, how the years ran away.

[Hát Cho Ngày Hôm Qua]

Ngày hôm nao đời ta rất xanh
Và những năm tháng chưa già
Bâng khuâng hình như đã xa
Ta cố vui khúc hoan ca
Trong tim còn bao thiết tha
Đời đã vương lắm phong ba
Nhưng tâm hồn chưa băng giá
Khi xưa tâm hồn như nắng
Vui chơi dài theo tháng năm
Đời vẫn chưa nhuốm phong trần
Nên hương lòng say ái ân
Khi tóc xanh đã xa vời
Ta tiếc, ta nuối âm thầm
Ngày đó ta còn xuân.

[Chuyện Tình (Love Story)]

Biết dùng lời rất khó 
Để mà nói rõ 
Ôi biết nói gì? Cuộc tình lớn quá! 
Cuôc tình thứ nhất
Muôn kiếp muôn đời là tình vĩnh viễn
Vì người đã khiến đôi cánh tay này
Nghìn đời quyến luyến.

She fills my heart
She fills my heart
With very special things with angel songs
With wild imaginings
She fills my soul
With so much love that anywhere I go
I'm never lonely with her along
Who could be lonely 
I reach for her hand
It's always there

And now the end is near
And so I face the final curtain
My friend i'll say it clear
I'll state my case of which I'm certain
I've lived a life that's full
I traveled each and every highway
And more, much more than this
I did it my way
Yes there were times I'm sure you knew
When I bit off more than I could chew
But through it all when there was doubt
I ate it up and spit it out, I faced it all
And I stood tall and did it my way

3. Are You Lonesome Tonight
Are you lonesome tonight
Do you miss me tonight?
Are you sorry we drifted apart?
Does your memory stray to a brighter sunny day
When I kissed you and called you sweetheart?
Do the chairs in your parlor seem empty and bare?
Do you gaze at your doorstep and picture me there?
Is your heart filled with pain, shall I come back again?
Tell me dear, are you lonesome tonight?

[Stand By Me]

When the night, has come,
And the land is dark,
And the moon is the only, light we'll see.
No I won't, be afraid,
No I, won't be afraid,
Just as long, as you stand,
Stand by me.
And darling, darling
Stand by me, stand by me,
Just as long, as you stand,
Stand by me.
If the sky, that we look upon.
Should tumble and fall,
All the mountains, crumble, to the sea.
I won't cry, I won't cry,
No ,I, won't shed a tear,
Just as long, as you stand,
Stand by me.

Whenever you're in trouble just stand by me
Oh stand by me
Whoa stand now, oh stand, stand by me
                        
                    |
