                        When I fall in love
Trình bày: Celine Dion - Clive Griffin

When I fall I love
....
it will be forever
...
or I'll never fall 
...
in love
...
Or I'll never never fall in love
...
In a restless world like this is
...
Love is ended before it begun
...
And too many moonlight kisses
...
Seem to cool in the warmth of the sun
...
When I give my heart
...
it will be completely
...
or I'll never give 
...
I'll never give
...
my heart
...
or I'll never give my heart
...
And the moment 
...
I can feel that
...
you feel that way too
...
I feel that way too
...
is when I fall in love
...
I fell in love
with you
...
When I fall in love
...
When I fall in love
...
With you
