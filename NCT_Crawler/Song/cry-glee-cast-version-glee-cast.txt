                        If anyone ask , I'll tell them we both just moved on 
When people all stare I'll pretend that I don't hear them talk
Whenever I see you , I'll swallow my pride , and bite my tounge
Pretend I'm ok with it all
Act like there's nothing wrong

Is it over yet?
Can I open my eyes?
Is this as hard as it gets?
Is this what it feels like to really...

Cry........
Cry........

If anyone ask , I'll tell them we just grew apart
Why do I care , if they believe me or not
Whenever I feel , your memory is breaking my heart
I'll pretend I'm ok with it all
Act like there's nothing wrong

Is it over yet?
Can I open my eyes?
Is this hard as it gets?
Is this what it feels like to really...

Cry......
Cry......

I'm talking in circles
I'm lying they know it
Why won't this just stop go away?

Is it over yet?
Can I open my eyes?
Is this as hard as it gets?
Is this what it feels like to really...

Cry......
Cry......
Cry......
