[Eminem]
This motherf*cker man, just won't shut up will you?
Talk about I owe you, bitch you owe me
I'm promoting you right now
Man lets put the nail in his coffin

[Chorus]
I dont want to be like this
I dont really want to hurt no feelins
But Im only bein real when I say nobody wants to hear their grandfather rap
Old men have heart attacks
and I dont want to be responsible for that so
Put the mic down and walk away
You can still have a little bit of dignity

[verse 1]
I would never claim to be no Ray Benzino
an 83 year old fake Pachino
So how can he hold me over some balcony
without throwin his lower back out as soon as he goes to lift me
Please dont, youl probably fall with me
and our asses will both be history
But then again youl finnally get your wish
cuz youl be all over the street like 50 Cent
F*ckin punk pussy *** you chump
gimme a one-on-one see if I dont f*ck you up
Tryin to jump the Ruff Ryders and they cut you up
And you put Jada on a track thats how much you suck
dick in the industry, swear that you in the streets hustlin
You sit behind a f*ckin desk at The Source butt-kissin
and beggin motherf*ckers for guest appearences
and you can even get the clearances cuz real lyricists
dont even respect you or take you serious
Its not that we dont like you, we hate you - period
Talk about a mid-life crisis damn
last week you was shakin Obie Trice's hand
Now hes a busta? What the f*cks with that?
Get on a track dissin us kissin 50's ass
and askin me what I know about inditements-bite me
bitch I got two cases, and probation - fight me!
What do I know about standin in front of a judge like a man
ready to take whatever sentence he hands
What you know about your wife slicin her wrists
right in front of the only thing you have in this world - a little girl?
And I put that on her, when this is all over
I would never try to make her a star and eat off her
I dont know *** about no shoppin rocks
But what you know about hip-hop shops rockin spots?
When your the only white boy in that bitch just rippin
pressin up your own flyers and your stickers stickin
them bitches up after spendin six hours at Kinkos
Just makin copys of your covers of casette singles
and sell them out the trunk of your Tracer
Spendin your whole paycheck at Disc Makers
What you know about bein bullied over half your life?
Oh thats right, you know what thats like, your half white
Vanilla Ice,spill the beans and rice, Im eaten you alive inside
Jesus Christ, if your that much of a gangster, put the mic down
You should be out killin motherf*ckers right now
Kill a motherf*cker dead, kill'em dead bitch
Shoot'em in the f*ckin head, go ahead bitch
Slap my mom, slap the f*ck outa her!
She cant sue you, she wouldnt get a buck out of you
Cuz your broke as *** you suck your a f*ckin joke
If you was really sellin coke, well then what the f*ck
you stop for dummy? If you slew some crack
you'd make alot more money than you do from rap
You never had no security, you'll never be famous
You'l never now what its like to be rich, lifes a bitch aint it?
Raymond, here, let me break this *** down in lamens
terms for you just to make sure that you can understand this
and Canibus they usin too many complicated f*ckin words for you
Here then let me slow it down for you
so you can understand if I say it slower:
Let it go dawg it's over
[Chorus]
[Eminem talkin]
Haha
Talkin bout I have motherf*ckers callin your crib
bitch you aint even got a f*ckin crib

Threatened to shut me down at your little f*ckin Source magazine
if I come back then you would attack me, bitch you attacked me first
take it like a man and shut the f*ck up
and f*ck your little magazine too
I dont need your f*ckin magazine, I got XXL number anywayz
And yall cant stand it cuz there gettin bigger than yall
oh, and by the way, howed I look on the VMAs?
When you was watchin me from whatever f*ckin TV you was watchin me from in Boston
The mean streets of Boston, f*ckin sissy
Like you got us scared in the mother***er, suck our motherf*ckin dicks
Oh, and for those thats dont know, dont get it twisted yo, the Source has a white owner
