 Please hear me
 I want to tell you
 Please sing to me 
I wanna hear your voice 

I wonder why we have to kill each other so long?
 We've been through the fights 
Now we will have to sacrifice
 I can't ignore this matter
 I can't think of you for now All of my life, It's been up and down for me

 It seems our road through life hasn't got any better 
We need to find the way
 We will put an end to this
 I've been hold these feeling everyday
 And heartache when I think of you
 I need some help
 I can rely on you

 Many lives were lost but we're still alive
 We can make our self better
 But I don't cry for destiny
 We must find out how to live and die 
The truth is never everything that you can see

 I'll never let you go 
You are the only one
 Forever but it's come to own me
 For anyone can hold my hand
 Oh you can trust in me
 Could hear the siren
 And the sky is crying loud as ever
 I can sense the vibe between you and me

 I wonder why we have to kill each other so long?
 We've been through the fights
 Now we will have to sacrifice 
Can I ignore this situation? 
I can't think of you for now
All of my life, It's been up and down for me 

Many lives were lost but we're still alive
We can make our self better 
But I don't cry for destiny
We must find out how to live and die
The truth is never everything that you can see 

I'll never let you go
You are the only one 
Forever but it's come to own me 
For anyone can hold my hand 
Oh you can trust in me 
Could hear the siren 
And the sky is crying loud as ever 
I can sense the vibe between you and me 

Freezing cold shatters my sorrow 
And scorching sand puts it together again 
Freezing cold shatters my sorrow 
And scorching sand puts it together again

Oh It's more than anything 
That you are on my side 
The hands of time won't stop 
I wonder where you are 
Then it's more than everything 
That you are the best for me 
All of our life 
Every piece 
Heaven's peace 

We'll never forget you 
You are the only one 
Forever but it's come to own me 
For anyone can hold my hand 
Oh you can trust in me 
Could hear the siren 
And the sky is crying loud as ever 
I can feel this bond between you and me 

Please hear me 
I want to tell you 
Please sing to me 
I wanna hear your voice
                        
                    |
