                        Bài hát: Everything - M2M

It's been nine days, eight hours
Forty minutes, ten seconds
Since you called
I've been so crazy
I've just about
Taken our picture
Off the wall
It's been three months
Over hundred days
Since you held my hand
And I miss you in
A thousand ways
Will I ever see you again?

[BRIDGE:]
How did it change so fast?
(I won't give you
To the past)
I really thought it'd last

[CHORUS:]
All that we had was
So unbelievable
Now that it's gone
It's just inconceivable
Still in my dreams
You were so damn beautiful
How could it be
That you ruined my
Everything
Everything
Everything?

Everything
Everything
Everything

It seems like
Everywhere everyone's in love
So, where are you?
And I remember
You couldn't get enough
Said you felt it too
So didn't you

[Repeat bridge]
[Repeat chorus twice]

Everything, everything, everything
Everything, everything, everything

Ooh, hooh 
You're really my everything
Everything, everything
Everything, everything, everything

Everything, everything, everything
Everything, everything, everything
Everything, everything, everything
Everything, everything, everything

It's been nine days, eight hours
Forty minutes, ten seconds
Three months, a hundred days
And I miss you in
A thousand ways

[Repeat bridge]
[Repeat chorus]
                        
                    |
