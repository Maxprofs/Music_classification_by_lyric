                        She's getting out of bed at half past ten 
She starts to comeb her hair 
Just an ordinary day 
She looks at her reflection off the wall 
Why do I care at all 
Just an ordinary day 
An ordinary day that's hurting you 

Don't hide out inside yourself 
If you only let the sunshine on you 
I promise you 
You're not alone 
When the lights go out at night 
When you're feeling lost inside 
You're not alone 
You're not alone (you're not alone) 
When your world is falling down 
I will be the one around 
You're not alone 
You're not alone 

She's waiting for the bus it's twelve fiffy nine 
She's sitting on her own 
Just an ordinary day 
She's looking at the people passing her by 
It could be you and I 
They would never dream of slowing down to see if she's alright 

Don't hide out inside yourself 
If you only let the sunshine on you 
I promise you 
You're not alone 
When the lights go out at night 
When you're feeling lost inside 
You're not alone 
You're not alone (you're not alone) 
When your world is falling down 
I will be the one around 
You're not alone 
You're not alone 

I'm hurting (you're not alone) 
She's hurting (you're not alone) 
I'm so alone..... 

You're not alone (you're not alone) 
When the lights go out at night 
When you're feeling lost inside (you're not alone) 
You're not alone (you're not alone) 
When your world is falling down 
I will be the one around 
You're not alone
