                        Bài hát: Trees - Twenty One Pilots

I know where you stand
Silent in the trees
And thats where I am
Silent in the trees.
Why won't you speak
Where I happen to be?
Silent in the trees
Standing cowardly.

I can feel your breath.
I can feel my death.
I want to know you.
I want to see.
I want to say, hello.
                        
                    |
