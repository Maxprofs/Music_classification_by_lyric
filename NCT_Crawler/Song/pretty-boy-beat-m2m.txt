                        I lie a wake at night 

See things in black and white 
I only got you inside my mind 
you know you have made me blind 
I lie awake and pray 
that you will look my way 
I have all this longing in my heart 
I knew it right from the start 
Oh my pretty pretty boy 
I love you 
Like i never ever loved no one before you 
Pretty pretty boy you're mine 
Just tell me you love me too 
Oh my pretty pretty boy 
I need you 
Oh my pretty pretty boy i do 
Let me inside 
Make me stay 
Right beside you 
I used to write your name 
And put it in a frame 
And sometimes i think i hear you call 
Right from my bedroom wall 
You stay a little while 
and touch me with your smile 
And what can i say to make you mine 
To reach out for you in time 
Oh my pretty pretyy boy 
I love you Like i never ever loved no one before you 
Pretty pretty boy you're mine 
Just tell me you love me too 
Oh my pretty pretty boy 
I need you 
Oh my pretty pretty boy i do 
Let me inside 
Make me stay 
Right beside you 
Oh pretty boy,pretty boy,pretty boy 
say you love me too 
Oh my pretty pretty boy 
I love you 
Like i never ever loved no one before you 
Just tell me you love me too 


Oh my pretty pretty boy 
I need you 
Oh my pretty pretty boy i do 
Let me inside 
make me stay 
Right beside you.
