                        Bài hát: Let's Talk About Love - Modern Talking

Let me rock you, let me roll you, take my hand
I will take you to a new star called a promise-land
Let me love you, let me hold you with all my heart
Trust me baby like I trust you, I did from the start

And each 'n' every day, I'm gonna always say

[Chorus:]
Let's talk about love, love love love
That's all I'm dreamin' of
Let's talk about love, it's up to you
To make your dreams come true
Look in my eyes, there is a way
Don't throw your dreams away
You never lose, keep love alive
Baby then our love survives

Let me rock you, let me roll you, I'll be close to you
We can have a one-way trip to paradise for two
There is so much all can give you, I'll give all my heart
We can always be together, never break apart

And each 'n' every day, I'm gonna always say

(Chorus)
                        
                    |
