                        Smoke the weed, everyday
 Don't smoke the seeds, no way
 Smoke the weed, hey
 Smoke the weed Younger generation
 Young boys and girls
 Be careful of the seeds you show
 If you wan fi see a strong tree grow
 You gotta put them for the future
 Show respect don't neglect mother nature
 All the pollution in this world
 Me just can't stand it
 Global warming make the whole world panic
 Take care of mother earth cause ah she be the planet
 Youth man don't go astray
 Fresh trees, young seeds all tryin' to find the light
 Stretchin' out their limbs to the sun, got them right
 Help them keep their life will trap
 Watch out for life like satellite
 Them winds will stop and go like a traffic light
 Many obstacles to overcome in the city life
 Making sure they stay pure, teach them whats wrong from right
 Seed brings forth new life Smoke the weed, everyday
 Don't smoke the seeds, no way
 Smoke the weed
 Smoke the weed Hey are you on your own
 Six AM inna di morning
 When mi just ah wake up
 Stick the peer pockets been dallin'
 The baba hurt me break up
 Holding my fight the herb me cyan stand it
 Me solely see babylon can't come step on it
 Mi ah mix di weed with ah grey goose and tonic
 Rude man don't stop all di chronic, everyday
 Mi Roll me the weed up
 Take off you shot then me mix a couple breed up
 Can't stand it when some boy go, the seed up
 We no do that if they cheat up
 And me seh herb herb what we all prefer
 And my juggly top street girl
 And di youth a say weed is life
 Weed is reality Smoke the weed, everyday
 Don't smoke the seeds, no way
 Smoke the weed, hey
 Smoke the weed Early light papa you damn my supper
 Asking my pop off hot like the summer
 You can't never understand why we live the life
 You would never recognize unless you see the fire in my eyes I'm burrying the man like every single day
 Black birds in the sky can't get a break
 The smoke is my gun that's how I blow them away
 Music is my weapon rewind it let it play
 Babylon the police sun set all day
 They call me Snoop Lion I smoke everyday Look granded they see
 Watch them grow a new breed
 Cultivating these streets
 Recycle, carries on And on and on and on it don't stop
 The tic tac of the universal clock
 To the bang bang boogie the love streaming through me
 And the smoke that wait while we procreate Smoke the weed, everyday
 Don't smoke the seeds, no way
 Smoke the weed
 Smoke the weed
