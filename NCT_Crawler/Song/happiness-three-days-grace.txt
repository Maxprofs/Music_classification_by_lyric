                        Title: Happiness
Artist: Three Days Grace 
.
I reach out when I have a confession
I reach out with desperation
I reach out but no one is listening
So I go looking for the next best thing
.
Happiness, straight from the bottle
When real life''s too hard to swallow
Happiness, straight from the bottle
When real life''s too hard to swallow
.
I feel them judging on me for their own pleasure
If they really knew, they''d know better
They''re on the one who caves under pressure
When desperate times call for desperate measures
.
Happiness, straight from the bottle
When real life''s too hard to swallow
Happiness, straight from the bottle
When real life''s too hard to swallow
.
I know there''s gotta be some peace in me
But I can''t find it
I get so sick of the lucky
.
Happiness, straight from the bottle
When real life''s too hard to swallow
Happiness, straight from the bottle
When real life''s too hard to swallow
.
Too hard to swallow
.
