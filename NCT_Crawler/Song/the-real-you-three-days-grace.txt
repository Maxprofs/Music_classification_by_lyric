                        Bài hát: The Real You - Three Days Grace

I will never give up on you
I see the real you
Even if you don't I do
I do
I will never give up on you
I see the real you
Even if you don't I do
I do

And I'll Show you the road to follow
I'll keep you safe till tomorrow
I'll pull you away from sorrow
I see the real you
Even if you don't I do

If you're the one, to run, to run;
I'll be the one, the one, you run to!
If you're the one, to run, to run;
I'll be the one, the one, you run to!

I will never give up on you
I see the real you
Even if you don't I do
I do
I will never give up on you
I see the real you
Even if you don't I do
I do

And it seems like I've known you forever
I'll keep you safe for one more night
Need you to know that it's all right
I see the real you
Even if you don't I do
I do

If you're the one, to run, to run;
I'll be the one, the one, you run to!
You're not the only lonely one
I see the real you
Even if you don't I do
(I do, I do, I do)
                        
                    |
