                        Bài hát: Never Be - 5 Seconds Of Summer

I need your love to light up this house
I wanna know what you're all about
I wanna feel you feel you tonight
I wanna tell you that it's alright.

I need your love to guide me back home
When I'm with you I'm never alone
I need to feel you feel you tonight
I need to tell you that it's alright.

We'll never be as young as we are now,
It's time to leave this old black & white town.
Let's seize the day, let's run away,
Don't let the colours fade to grey.

We'll never be as young as we are now,
As young as we are now.

I've seen myself here in your eyes
I stay awake til the sunrise
I wanna hold you hold you all night
I wanna tell you that you're all mine.

I felt our hands intertwine
I hear our hearts beating in time
I need to hold you hold you all night
I need to tell you that you're all mine.

We'll never be as young as we are now,
It's time to leave this old black & white town.
Let's seize the day, let's run away,
Don't let the colours fade to grey.

We'll never be as young as we are now,
As young as we are now.

We won't wait for tomorrow
It's too late we don't follow x2

We'll never be as young as we are now,
Its time to leave this old black & white town.
Let's seize the day, let's run away,
Don't let the colours fade to grey.

We'll never be as young as we are now,
As young as we are now.

As young as we are now.
