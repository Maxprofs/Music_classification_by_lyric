                        Bài hát: Someone In The Crowd (From "La La Land" Soundtrack) - Emma Stone, Callie Hernandez, Sonoya Mizuno, Jessica Rothe

You got the invitation, you got the right address
You need some medication, the answer's always yes
A little chance encounter could be the one you've waited for
Just squeeze a bit more

Tonight we're on a mission, tonight's the casting call
This is the real audition, oh God help us all
You make the right impression then everybody knows your name
We're in the fast lane
Someone in the crowd could be the one you need to know
The one to finally lift you off the ground
Someone in the crowd could take you where you want to go
If you're the someone ready to be found

Do what you need to do
Til' they discover you
And make them more than you're seeing now
And the stars align
I think I'll stay behind
magical and fine
That someone in the crowd

That someone in the crowd

Is someone in the crowd the only thing you really see?
Watching while the world keeps spinning 'round
Somewhere there's a place where I find who I'm gonna be
A somewhere that's just waiting to be found

Someone in the crowd will be the one you need to know
Somone who can lift you off the ground
Someone in the crowd will take you where you want to go
Someone in the crowd will make you
Someone in the crowd will take you
Finally off the ground, with only someone ready to be found
                        
                    |
