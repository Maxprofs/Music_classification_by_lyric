                        Bài hát: Into You - Ariana Grande

I'm so into you, I can barely breathe
And all I wanna do, is to fall in deep
But close ain't close enough, 'til we cross the line, yeah
So name a game to play, and I'll roll the dice, hey

Oh baby, look what you've started
The temperature's rising in here
Is this gonna happen?
Been waitin' and waitin' for you to make a move
(Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Before I make a move
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)

So baby come light me up, and maybe I'll let you on it
A little bit dangerous, but baby that's how I want it
A little less conversation, and a little more touch my body
'Cause I'm so into you, into you, into you
Got everyone watchin' us, so baby let's keep this secret
A little bit scandalous, but baby don't let them see it
A little less conversation, and a little more touch my body
'Cause I'm so into you, into you, into you

[Verse 2]
(Oh yeah)
This could take some time, hey
Made too many mistakes, better get this right (right, baby)

Tell me what you came here for
'Cause I can't, I can't wait no more
I'm on the edge and no control
And I need, I need you to know (you to know)
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, yeah)

So come light me up, so come light me up my baby
A little dangerous, a little dangerous my baby
A little less conversation, and a little more touch my body
'Cause I'm so into you, into you, into you
(I'm so into you)
