                        Bài hát: Beautiful Life - Ace Of Base

You can do what you want just seize the day 
What you're doing tomorrow's gonna come your way 
Don't you ever consider givin' up, you will find, oooh 

It's a beautiful life, oh oh ooo 
It's a beautiful life, oh oh ooo 
It's a beautiful life, oh oh ooo 
I just wanna be here beside you 
And stay until the break of dawn 

Take a walk in the park when you feel down 
There's so many things there 
That's gonna lift you up 
See the nature in bloom a laughing child 
Such a dream, oooh 

It's a beautiful life, oh oh ooo 
It's a beautiful life, oh oh ooo 
It's a beautiful life, oh oh ooo 
I just wanna be here beside you 
I just wanna be here beside you 
And stay until the break of dawn 

You're looking for somewhere to belong 
You're standing all alone 
For someone to guide you on your way 
Now and Forever 

It's a beautiful life, oh oh ooo 
It's a beautiful life, oh oh ooo 
It's a beautiful life, oh oh ooo 
I just wanna be anybody 

Living in different ways 
It's a beautiful life 
I'm gonna take you to a place I've never been 
Before oh yeah 
It's a beautiful life 
I'm gonna take you in my arms and fly away 
With you tonight 

It's a beautiful life, oooh 
It's a beautiful life, oooh 

It's a beautiful life, oooh 
It's a beautiful life, oooh 
It's a beautiful life, oooh 
It's a beautiful life
