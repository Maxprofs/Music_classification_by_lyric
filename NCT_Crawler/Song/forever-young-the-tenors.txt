                        May God bless and keep you always
 May your wishes all come true
 May you always do for others, let others do for you
 May you build a ladder to the sky, climb on every rung
 And may you stay, forever young May you grow up to be righteous, may grown up to be true
 May you always know the truth and see the light surrounding you
 May you always be courageous, stand upright and be strong
 May you stay, forever young Forever young, (echo)

 May you stay, (echo)
 Forever May your hands always be busy, may your feet always be swift
 May you have a strong foundation, with no winds of changes shift
 May your heart always be joyful, your song always be sung
 And may you stay, forever young Forever young, (echo)
 Forever young, (echo)
 May you stay, (echo)
 Forever young, (echo)
 And may you stay, (echo) May God bless and keep you always
 May your wishes always come true
