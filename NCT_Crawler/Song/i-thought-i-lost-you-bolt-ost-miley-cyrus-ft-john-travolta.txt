                        Nobody listens to me 
Don’t hear a single thing I've said 
Say anything to soothe me 
Anything to get you from my head 
Don't know how I really feel 
The faith it takes to make like I don't care 
Don’t know how much it hurts 
To turn around like you were never there 
Like somehow you could be replaced 
And I could walk away from the promises we made 
And swore we’d never break 

MILEY AND TRAVOLTA CHORUS 
I thought I lost you (when you ran away to try to find me) 
I thought I’d never see your sweet face again 
I turned around and you were gone and on and on the days went 
But I kept the moments that we were in 
'cause I hoped in my heart you'd come back to me, my friend 
And now I got you, but I thought I lost you 

TRAVOLTA 
I felt so empty out there 
And there were days I had my doubts 
But I knew I'd find you somewhere 
Because I knew I couldn't live without 
You in my life for one more day 
And I swore I'd never break those (promises we made) 

MILEY AND TRAVOLTA CHORUS 
I thought I lost you when you ran away to try to find me 
I thought I’d never see your sweet face again 
I turned around and you were gone and on and on the days went 
But I kept the moments that we were in 
'cause I hoped in my heart you'd come back to me, my friend 
And now I got you, but I thought I lost you 

TRAVOLTA 
I told myself I wouldn’t sleep 'till I searched the world from sea to sea 

MILEY 
I made a wish upon a star, I turned around and there you were 

MILEY AND TRAVOLTA 
Now here we are, are 

MILEY 
Here we are 
I thought I lost you 

TRAVOLTA 
I thought I lost you, too 

MILEY 
I thought I lost you 

TRAVOLTA 
I thought I lost you 

MILEY 
Yeah 

MILEY AND TRAVOLTA CHORUS 
I thought I lost you when you ran away to try to find me 
I thought I’d never see your sweet face again 
I turned around and you were gone and on and on the days went 
But I kept the moments that we were in 
And I knew in my heart you'd come back to me, my friend 
And now I got you, but I thought I lost you 

MILEY 
But I thought I lost you 

TRAVOLTA 
I thought I lost you, too 

BOTH 
So glad I got you, got you 

MILEY 
So glad I got you, yeah yeah 
I thought I lost you 

TRAVOLTA 
I thought I lost you, too
