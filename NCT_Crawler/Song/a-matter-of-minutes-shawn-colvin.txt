                        The A*teens released a second album on Feburary 27, 2000 entitled "Teen Spirit". The first single 'Upside Down(Bouncing Off the Ceiling) was a #1 hit
 Around the world. This album was unique because you saw a more mature side of teh A*teens and to much surpirse they didn't do any re-makes. After the cdsold
 A couple thousand, maybe millions, they were signed to the Aaron Carter Tour "Aaron's Party". Where they were the opening act before he came out on stage.

 I've been thinking
 About you and me
 Maybe I was just
 Seeing what I wanted to see

 You can call me crazy
 But you know this time I swore
 That I wouldn't run
 But I can't do that anymore

 I can't find a way to stay
 And I can't see my way to go
 But I can't give up without a fight.

 I can pack myself up in a matter of minutes,
 Leave you all far behind
 All of my old world and all the things in it are hard to find
 If they ever were mine

 You've been trying
 And I know it's been hard
 And I'm afraid of
 All this blood in my heart

 If there's one thing certain
 It's there ain't nothing for sure
 And I want to run
 But I can't do that anymore

 I can't meet you half way
 And I can't have it my way
 And I can't give up without a fight

 I can pack myself up in a matter of minutes,
 Leave you all far behind
 And all of my old world and all the things in it are hard to find
 All of my old world and all the things in it are hard to find
 Like they ever were mine

 I could count the good times we had
 On one hand
 All the rest was
 A sort of means to the end

 Well not it's done
 And I can never
 Go back to where I was before
 And I wanna run...

 I can get myself clean in a matter of minutes
 And get it wrong every time
 All of my whole world and all the things in it are hard to, hard to find
 Everything change in a matter of minutes
 And nothing was saved in time
 All of my old world and all the things in it are hard to find
 But they never
 Never
 Never
 Were mine
                        
                    |
