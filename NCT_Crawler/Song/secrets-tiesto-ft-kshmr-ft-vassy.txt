Oh won't you stay for awhile
I'll take you on a ride
If you can keep our secrets
Oh won't you stay for awhile
Show me darkness baby
Show me deepness

Oh won't you stay for awhile
I'll take you on a ride
If you can keep our secrets
Oh won't you stay for awhile
Show me goggles baby
Show me deepness

Oh won't you stay for awhile
Oh won't you stay for awhile
I'll take you on a ride
If you can keep our secrets

Stay awhile, stay awhile
And I will make it
Worth your while
Worth your while

Stay awhile, stay awhile
And Imma go the extra mile
Extra mile
Extra mile

Boy if you wait
Until the lights go down
I got some tricks that have you
Screaming now so

Stay awhile, stay awhile
And I will make it
Worth your while
Worth your while

Oh won't you stay for awhile
Oh won't you stay for awhile

Oh won't you stay for awhile
I'll take you on a ride
If you can keep our secrets
