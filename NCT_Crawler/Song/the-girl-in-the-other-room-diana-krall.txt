                        The girl in the other room
 She knows by now
 There's something in all of her fears
 Now she wears it threadbare
 She sits on the floor
 The glass pressed tight to the wall
 She hears murmurs low
 The paper is peeling
 Her eyes staring straight at the ceiling Maybe they're there
 Or maybe it's nothing at all
 As she draws lipstick smears on the wall The girl in the other room
 She powders her face
 And stares hard
 Into her reflection The girl in the other room
 She stifles a yawn
 Adjusting the strap of her gown
 She tosses her tresses
 Her lover undresses
 Turning the last lamp light down
 What's that voice we're hearing?
 We should be sleeping
 Could that be someone who's weeping? Maybe she's there
 Or maybe there's nothing to see
 It's just a trace of what used to be The girl in the other room
 She darkens her lash
 And blushes
 She seems to look familiar
                        
                    |
