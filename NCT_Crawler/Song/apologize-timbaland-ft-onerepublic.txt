                        Bài hát: Apologize(Album Version) - Timbaland, OneRepublic

I'm holding on your rope
Got me ten feet off the ground
And I'm hearing what you say
But I just can't make a sound
You tell me that you need me
Then you go and cut me down
But wait.........
You tell me that you're sorry
Didn't think I'd turn around
And say................

[CHORUS]
That it's too late to apologize
I'ts too late
I said it's too late to apologize
It's too late
Yeah!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I'd take another chance
take a fall,take a shot for you
I need you like a heart needs a beat
But it's nothing new,yeah!!!
I loved you with a fire red
Now it's turning blue
And you say
Sorry,like an angel
Heaven let me think was you.....
But I'm afriad

[CHORUS]

[INTERCLUDE]

[CHORUS]

I said it's too late to apologize,yeah!
I said it's too late to apologize, yeah!!

I'm holding on your rope,
Got me ten feet off the ground.
