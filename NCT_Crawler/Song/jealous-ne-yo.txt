Title: Jealous
Artist: Ne-Yo

Said I’m jealous
I said I wish my hands could do 
what that dress is doing
Holding you tight 
and as your body’s moving...
And the way that glass of wine 
can ease your mind and soothe your...
Said I’m gonna do that to ya
Umm
From the wind that blows by
Stealin’ the scent of your perfume
To the sun that touches your skin
From the Sunday afternoon
I’m jealous
I said you got me jealous of 
everything
Everything that gets to know you 
(oh baby...)
Said you got me jealous of 
everything
Because nothing loved you like I do
I said nothing loved you like I do
Said I wish my house could be
Could be inside your head
To make you think of me
And you in your bed
Tattoo on your waistline
Uh, what I wouldn’t do?
Said what I wouldn’t give to be a permanent part of you

To the wind that blows by
Stealin’ the scent of your perfume
To the sun that touches your skin
From the Sunday afternoon
I’m jealous
Got me jealous of everything oh oh
Everything that gets to know you oh oh
You got me jealous of everything
Because nothing loved you like I do
Then listen to me, nothing loves you like I do
I said nothing loved you like I do
Girl, I try
But everything I am to keep my code
But everywhere we go, girl you can’t jask
And they don’t deserve your presence 
or looking at you girl
Look and I know why
Sound a little crazy, yea that’s true
But baby when it comes to you and I
Said I’ll be crazy for you, girl I’m so damn jealous
Said I’m je-je-jealous
Said I’m je-je-jealous
Said I’m je-je-jealous
Got me jealous of everything
Said I’m je-je-jealous
To everything that gets to know you (Said I’m je-je-jealous)
You got me jealous of everything
Said I’m je-je-jealous
Nothing loves you like I do
Said I’m je-je-jealous
Got me jealous of everything
Said I’m je-je-jealous
To everything that gets to know you (Said I’m je-je-jealous)
You got me jealous of everything
Said I’m je-je-jealous
Nothing loves you like I do
Said I’m je-je-jealous
I said nothing loves you like I do
Said I’m je-je-jealous
Baby, nothing loves you like I do
Said I’m je-je-jealous
Then listen to me, nothing loves you like I do
Said I’m je-je-jealous
I said nothing loves you like I do
Like I do... baby...
Said like I do...uuh...baby...uuh...yea...yea
