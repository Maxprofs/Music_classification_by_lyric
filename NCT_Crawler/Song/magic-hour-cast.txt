                        Take a good look
 In your own time
 See the world laugh
 Through a child's eyes
 [Chorus:]
 Sunshine, shine until you're mine
 It's just a magic hour
 Just a magic hour
 Such a magic hour
 Now I know we can drift away now
 If only we find a way out
 Now I know we can drift away now
 If only to find a way out, out, out
 Take a good look
 In your own time
 See the world turn
 Through your own eyes
 (Repeat Chorus)
 Now I know we can drift away now
 If only we find a way out
 Now I know we can drift away now
 If only we find a way out, out, out
 (Repeat Chorus)
 Now I know we can drift away now
 If only we find a way out
 Now I know we can drift away now
 If only to find a way out
 Now I know we can drift away now
 If only we find a way out
 Now I know we can drift away now
 If only we find a way out, out, out
 Out, out, out
                        
                    |
