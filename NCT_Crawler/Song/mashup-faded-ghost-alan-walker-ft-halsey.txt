I'm searching for something that I can't reach.
I'm searching for something that I can't reach.

I don't like them innocent 
I don't want no face fresh 
Want em wearing leather 
Begging, let me be your taste test 

I like the sad eyes, bad guys 
Mouth full of white lies 
Kiss me in the corridor
                        
                    |
