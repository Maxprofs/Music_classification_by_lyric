                        Looking in your eyes I see a paradise
 This world that I found is too good to be true
 Standing here beside you want so much to give you
 This love in my heart that I'm feeling for you Let them say "We're crazy", I don't care about that
 Put your hand in my hand, baby, don't ever look back
 Let the world around us just fall apart
 Baby, we can make it if we're heart to heart And we can build this dream together, standing strong forever
 Nothing's gonna stop us now
 And if this world runs out of lovers, we'll still have each other
 Nothing's gonna stop us, nothing's gonna stop us now I'm so glad I found you, I'm not gonna lose you
 Whatever it takes I will stay here with you
 Take it to the good times, see it through the bad times
 Whatever it takes is what I'm gonna do Let them say, "We're crazy", what do they know?
 Put your arms around me, baby, don't ever let go
 Let the world around us just fall apart
 Baby we can make it if we're heart to heart And we can build this dream together, standing strong forever
 Nothing's gonna stop us now
 And if this world runs out of lovers, we'll still have each other
 Nothing's gonna stop us, nothing's gonna stop us now All that I need is you
 All that I ever need and all that I want to do
 Is hold you forever, forever and ever And we can build this dream together, standing strong forever
 Nothing's gonna stop us now
 And if this world runs out of lovers, we'll still have each other
 Nothing's gonna stop us, nothing's gonna stop us And we can build this dream together, standing strong forever
 Nothing's gonna stop us now
 And if this world runs out of lovers, we'll still have each other
 Nothing's gonna stop us And we can build this dream together, standing strong forever
 Nothing's gonna stop us now
 And if this world runs out of lovers, we'll still have each other
 Nothing's gonna stop us, nothing's gonna stop us now
