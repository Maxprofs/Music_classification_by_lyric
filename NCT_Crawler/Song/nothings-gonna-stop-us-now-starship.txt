                        Song: Nothing's Gonna Stop Us Now - Starship

Looking in your eyes
i see a paradise
This world that i found is too good to be true
Standing here beside you
Want so much to give you this love in my heart
That I'm feeling for you.

Let them say we're crazy
I don't care about that
Put your hand in my hand
baby, don't ever look back
Let the world around us just fall apart
Baby, we can make it if we`re heart to heart

And we can build this dream together
Standing strong forever
Nothing's gonna stop us now
And if this world runs out of lovers
We'll still have each other
Nothing's gonna stop us
nothing's gonna stop us now ooh ohh

I'm so glad i found you
I'm not gonna lose you
Whatever it takes to i will stay here with you
Take it to the good times
See it through the bad times
Whatever it takes is what i'm gonna do

Let them say we're crazy
What do they know
Put your arms around me, baby
don't ever let go
Let the world around us just fall apart
Baby, we can make it if we`re heart to heart

And we can build this dream together
Standing strong forever
Nothing's gonna stop us now
And if this world runs out of lovers
We'll still have each other
Nothing's gonna stop us
nothing's gonna stop us

Oohh. all that i need is you
All that i ever need.
And all that i want to do 
is hold you forever
forever and ever

Hey

And we can build this dream together
Standing strong forever
Nothing's gonna stop us now
And if this world runs out of lovers
We'll still have each other
Nothing's gonna stop us
nothing's gonna stop us
oohh wooohh
Nothing's gonna stop us now
oo noo
hey baby
i knoww
nothings gunna stop us

And we can build this dream together
Standing strong forever
Nothing's gonna stop us now
And if this world runs out of lovers
We'll still have each other
Nothings gonna stop us
Nothings gonna stop us now
                        
                    |
