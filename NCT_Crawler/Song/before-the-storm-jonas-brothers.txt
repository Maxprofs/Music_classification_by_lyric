Jonas Brothers - Before The Storm (Feat Miley Cyrus)

I know this isn't what I wanted,
I never thought it come this far,
Just thinking back to where we started,
And how we lost all that we are.

We were young and times were easy.
But I could see it's not the same.
I'm standing here but you don't see me,
I'd give it all for that to change.
But I don't want to lose her,
Don't wanna let her go.

Standin' out in the rain,
Need to know if it's over,
'Cuz I will leave you alone.

I'm flooded with all this pain,
Knowing I'll never hold her

Like I did
Before the storm
(Yeah, before the storm)

With every strike of lightning,

Comes a memory that lasts.

And not a word is left unspoken,
As the thunder starts to crash.

Maybe I
Should give up.

Standin' out in the rain,
Need to know if it's over,
'Cuz I will leave you alone.

I'm flooded with all this pain,
Knowing I'll never hold her

Like I did
Before the storm

Trying to keep
The lights from going out

And the clouds from ripping out my broken heart.
They always say,
That a heart is not a home
Without the one who gets you through the storm.

Standin' out in the rain,
Knowin' that it's really over.
Please don't leave me alone.

I'm flooded with all this pain,
Knowing I'll never hold ya,
Like I did,
Before the storm.
(The storm)

Like I did
Before the storm.
