                        There I was waiting for a chance
Hoping that you'll understand
The things I wanna say
As my love went stronger than before
I wanna see you more and more
But you closed your door
Why don't you try to open up your heart
I won't take so much of your time

Maybe it's wrong to say please love me too
'Cause I know you'll never do
Somebody else is waitin' there inside for you
Maybe it's wrong to love you more each day
'Cause I know he's here to stay
But I know to whom you should belong

I believe what you said to me
We should set each other free
That's how you want it to be

But my love went stronger than before
I wanna see you more and more
But you closed your door
Why don't you try to open up your heart
I won't take so much of your time

Maybe it's wrong to say please love me too
'Cause I know you'll never do
Somebody else is waitin' there inside for you
Maybe it's wrong to love you more each day
'Cause I know he's here to stay
But my love is strong
I don't know if this is wrong
But I know to whom you should belong

Ohh, yeah yeah
Ohhh ohh

Maybe it's wrong to say please love me too
'Cause I know you'll never do
Somebody else is waitin' there inside for you
Maybe it's wrong to love you more each day
'Cause I know he's here to stay
But my love is strong
I don't know if this is wrong
But I know to whom you should belong
