                        Bài hát: Give Me Love - Don Diablo, Calum Scott

When the lights come one, the party’s over
And I ain’t got no car to drive you home
Would the night be too cold for me to hold ya?
Would you stay or would you leave me all alone?

‘Cos all the money in the world won’t mean a thing
With a hole in my heart it won’t beat again
It’s true, without you
Oh I’ve been layin’ in the dark, been outta my mind
I’m fallin’ from the highs
And I’m crashing trough the lows
Now I need to know

Can you give me love?
Give me love?
When I’m standing here with nothing
Would you show me I’m worth something
Give me love
Give me love
When it feels like it’s all over
Would you stay and pull me closer?
Give me love

If it rained in the middle of summer
Would you lay in the grass like we used to do?
Would you run, would you leave
Or change your number
If someone gave u the things I couldn’t give to you?
Pre
‘Cos all the money in the world won’t mean a thing
With a hole in my heart it won’t beat again
It’s true,without you
Oh I’ve been layin’ in the dark, been outta my mind
I’m fallin’ from the highs
And I’m crashing trough the lows
Now I need to know

Can you give me love?
Give me love?
When I’m standing here with nothing
Would you show me I’m worth something
Give me love
Give me love
When it feels like it’s all over
Would you stay and pull me closer?
Give me love
