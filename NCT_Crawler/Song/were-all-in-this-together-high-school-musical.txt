                        Bài hát : We're All In This Together - High School Muiscal

1. Together, together, together everyone
Together, together, come on lets have some fun
Together, were there for each other every time
Together together come on lets do this right.

Here and now its time for celebration
I finally figured it out (yeah yeah)
That all our dreams have no limitations
That's what its all about.

Everyone is special in their own way
We make each other strong (each other strong)
Were not the same 
Were different in a good way
Together's where we belong.

[Chorus:]
We're all in this together 
Once we know
That we are 
We're all stars 
And we see that
We're all in this together
And it shows
When we stand 
Hand in hand
Make our dreams come true.

2. Together, together, together everyone
Together, together, come on lets have some fun
Together, were there for each other every time
Together together come on lets do this right.

We're all here 
and speaking out with one voice
we're going to rock the house (rock the house)
the party's on now everybody make some noise
We're All In This Together lyrics on ***
come on scream and shout.

We've arrived becuase we stuck together
Champions one and all.

[Chorus x2]

[Bridge:]
Wild cats sing along 
Yeah, you really got it goin' on
Wild cats in the house
Everybody say it now
Wild cats everywhere 
Wave your hands up in the air
That's the way we do it
Lets get to it
Time to show the world.

[Coda:]
Wild cats everywhere 
Wave your hands up in the air
That's the way we do it 
Let's get to it 
Come on everyone!
                        
                    |
