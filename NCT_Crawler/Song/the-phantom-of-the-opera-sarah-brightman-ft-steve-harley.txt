                        The Phantom of the Opera
 Sang by Steve Harley and Sarah Brightman Sarah:
 Beneath the operahouse,
 I know he's there,
 He's with me on the stage,
 He's everywhere.
 And when my song begins,
 I always find,
 The Phantom of the Opera
 is there,
 inside my mind.
 Steve:
 Sing once again with me,
 our strange duet,
 my power over you,
 grows stronger yet.
 You give your love to me,
 for love is blind,
 the Phantom of the opera
 is now,
 your mastermind.
 Sarah:
 Those who have seen your face,
 draw back in fear,
 I am the mask you wear.
 Steve:
 It's me they hear.
 Sarah/Steve:
 Your/my spirit and my/your voice,
 in one combined,
 the Phantom of the opera
 is there,
 inside my/your mind.
 Steve:
 He's there'
 the Phantom of the opera,
 He's there the Phantom of the opera.
 Both:
 Sing once again with me,
 our strange duet.
 Steve:
 My power over you,
 grows stronger yet.
 Both:
 You give your love to me,
 for love is blind,
 the Phantom of the opera
 is now my/your mastermind.
 Sarah:
 He's there,
 the Phantom of the opera.
