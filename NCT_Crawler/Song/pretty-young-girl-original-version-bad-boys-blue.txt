                        I know life is different to you
First love can be frightening, that's true
But take me as your brother and your friend
And take me as your lover and your man

Ah-Ah

Pretty young girl on my mind
How I wish you to be mine (Woohoho)
Girl you're no child anymore
(No child, no child anymore)

Ah-Ah

Pretty young girl on my mind (On my mind)
Don't you know, know I can't hide (I can't hide)
(Woohoho) Can't hide my feelings
You're my girl and you're sixteen

Don't know (Don't know), is it wrong? Is it right?
Sweet girl (Sweet girl), I wanna love you tonight.
So, take me as your brother and your friend,
But, first of all, I want to be your man

Ah-Ah

Pretty young girl on my mind
How I wish you to be mine (Woohoho)
Girl you're no child anymore
(No child, no child anymore)

Ah-Ah

Pretty young girl on my mind (On my mind)
Don't you know, know I can't hide (I can't hide)
(Woohoho) Can't hide my feelings
You're my girl and you're sixteen

Pretty young girl on my mind
How I wish you to be mine (Woohoho)
Girl you're no child anymore
(No child, no child anymore)

Ah-Ah

Pretty young girl on my mind (On my mind)
Don't you know, know I can't hide (I can't hide)
(Woohoho) Can't hide my feelings
No more

[Fade out]
Pretty young girl on my mind
How I wish...
