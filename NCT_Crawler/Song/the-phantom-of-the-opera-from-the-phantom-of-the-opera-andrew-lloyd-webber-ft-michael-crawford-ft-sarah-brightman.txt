                        Bài hát: The Phantom Of The Opera - Phantom Of The Opera Original London Cast

In sleep he sang to me
in dreams he came...
that voice which calls to me
and speaks my name

And do I dream again?
For now I find
the Phantom of the Opera is there-
inside my mind...

Sing once again with me
our strange duet...
My power over you
grows stronger yet...

And though you turn from me,
to glance behind,
the Phantom of the Opera is there-
inside your mind...

Those who have seen your face
draw back in fear...
I am the mask you wear...

It's me they hear...

Your/my spirit and my/your voice,
in one combined:
the Phantom of the Opera is there-
inside your/my mind...

He's there, the Phantom of the Opera...
Beware the Phantom of the Opera...

In all your fantasies,
you always knew
that man and mystery...

...were both in you...

And in this labyrinth,
where night is blind,
the Phantom of the Opera is there/here-
inside your/my mind...

He's there the Phantom of the Opera
Sing, Sing my Angel of music, sing, Sing For Me!
