                        Bài hát: Sangria Wine - Pharrell Williams, Camila Cabello

Honey said she want somebody break her off proper
Now she so relentless so nothing can stop her
Never loved the city (come on, man) but she swear she's the darling (hey darling)
It's 'cause it's so awesome how she move her body
She do the sangria wine (woo), now the sangria wine (uh-huh)
Now moving side to side (woo), now front and behind (uh-huh)
Now sangria wine (woo), now sangria wine (uh-huh)
Now sangria wine (woo), do the sangria wine (uh-huh)

Move it, I move it
Move my body like it is a pipe
Tutti Frutti, is all that I got
Counter-clockwise, I'm mixin' it up (mixin' it up)
Sip it, sip it, I'll bet that you'll blush
Yo sé, yo sé, yo sé, yo sé que tú quieres mi cuerpo, eh
Y quieres controlar mi mente, eh

Y todo el mundo quiere ser dueño de ella
Pero nadie puede, ¡ay!
Honey said she want somebody break her off proper
Now she so relentless so nothing can stop her
Never loved the city (come on, man) but she swear she's the darling (hey darling)
It's 'cause it's so awesome how she move her body
She do the sangria wine (woo), now the sangria wine (uh-huh)
Now moving side to side (woo), now front and behind (uh-huh)

Now sangria wine (woo), now sangria wine (uh-huh)
Now sangria wine (woo), do the sangria wine (uh-huh)
Wait a minute
(Dos) Wait a second
(Tres) ¿Qué, qué?
Total sauce! (woo!)
Let's float around like the fruit at the top (huh)

In Miami, where winters are hot
Yo sé, yo sé, yo sé, yo sé que tú quieres mi cuerpo, eh
Y quieres controlar mi mente, eh
Y todo el mundo quiere ser dueño de ella
Pero nadie puede, ¡ay! (noo)
Honey said she want somebody break her off proper
Now she so relentless so nothing can stop her

Never loved the city (come on, man) but she swear she's the darling (hey darling)
It's 'cause it's so awesome how I move my body
She do the sangria wine (woo), now the sangria wine (uh-huh)
Now moving side to side (woo), now front and behind (uh-huh)
Now sangria wine (woo), now sangria wine (uh-huh)
Now sangria wine (woo), do the sangria wine (uh-huh)
