 Money
 For the money
 Money, Money

 [Verse:]
 Kanye told me that Jesus walks in '04
 But I grew up around Impalas and drug lords
 Welcome to Los Angeles
 Palm trees and drug stores
 All we know is rocks and Presidents like Mount Rushmore
 *** the police
 They hop out and bust doors
 I ain't goin back to jail, nigga
 That's what I flush for
 My money or my glock, Who do I trust more?
 I don't know, It's prolly the one that I touch more
 Guess It's the green cause paper motivate niggaz
 And my Rolex's racist cause it hate niggaz
 I used to only sell 8th's
 Like that Laker nigga
 Now I'm movin 24's like I play at the Staples Center
 You might miss The Game
 So nigga, Don't blink
 My Phantom stand out like Frank Lucas' mink
 So go ahead and think like Frank Lucas think
 Somebody'll find your brains on the ***in' kitchen sink
 About

 [Hook:]
 (Money)
 Dead presidents, Big paper
 (For the money)
 Benjamins, Skyscrapers, My niggaz get (Money)
 My bitches get (Money) like the strippers get
 From the block to the club, I'll make it rain (Money)
 In California niggaz die (For the money)
 From the south to New York them bullets fly for the (Money)
 Don't stop gettin' (Money)
 It don't matter where you're from
 If you hustle mutha***a, Keep gettin' that (Money)

 [Verse 2:]
 Yeah, I get at that Baby and Slim Cash money
 All the jewelry on your whole crew
 That's my tax money
 That Pablo Escobar crack money
 That Lebron, First Nike contract money
 That make it rain
 All my niggaz throw a stack money
 Stack it to the ceiling then call it Shaq money
 That walk in the club, Straight to the back money
 Flava of Love, Deelishis sittin on my lap money
 That rap money
 Niggaz get clapped money
 Air Force Ones don't bend when I trap money
 Ooh, I'm Rich like Porter
 Havin Alpo nightmares
 Whippin' that water
 Like Mcdonalds, I was flippin them orders
 In that '02 Porsche truck
 Whizzin' through borders
 I was through flippin quarters when I made my first mill
 I'm about a dollar, 50 Cent ain't real

 [Verse 3:]
 Somebody tell Snoop to pop open them briefcases
 Order that Patron
 Tell 'em we want three cases
 *** a Black Card, You see these green faces
 Look at my chest, Now you've seen Vegas
 Treat my money like the Crystal that we wasted
 Cause I'm a money machine
 I could remake it
 You a fool thinkin that Freddy could see Jayceon
 I been iced out like who the *** need Jacob
 The Doc told me to be patient
 But I want money like Dwight Howard
 Next time he a free agent
 I'm tryin' to make enough money so I can feed Asia
 And have Asians in the kitchen cookin in Louis V aprons
 Word to Martha Stewart
 If I could park a Buick
 Then I could flip a Brinks truck
 I got the heart to do it
 Ball like the nigga Tony Parker do it
 Speak no ingl–πs but Dinero, I talk it fluent
