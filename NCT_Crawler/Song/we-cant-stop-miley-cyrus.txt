                        Bài hát: We Can't Stop - Miley Cyrus

It’s our party we can do what we want, 
It’s our party we can say what we want 
It’s our party we can love who we want 
We can kiss who we want 
We can live how we want 
(Repeat) 

Red cups and sweaty bodies everywhere 
Hands in the air like we don’t care 
Cause we came to have so much fun now 
Got somebody here might get some now 
If you’re not ready to go home 
Can I get a hello? 
Cause we gonna go all night, till we see the sunlight, alright 
So la da dee da dee, we like to party 
Dancing with Miley, doin’ whatever we want 
This is our house, this is our rules 
And we can’t stop, and we won’t stop 
Can’t you see it’s we who own the night? 
Can’t you see it’s we who ’bout that life? 
And we can’t stop, and we won’t stop 
We run things, things don’t run we 
We don’t take nothing from nobody, yeah yeah 

It’s our party we can do what we want, 
It’s our party we can say what we want 
It’s our party we can love who we want 
We can kiss who we want 
We can live how we want 

To my homegirls here with the big butt 
Shaking it like we at a strip club 
Remember only God could judge ya, forget the haters, cause somebody loves ya 
Everyone in line in the bathroom 
Trying to get a **** in the bathroom 
We all so turned up here, getting turned up yeah, yeah yeah yeah 

So la da dee da dee, we like to party 
Dancing with Miley, doin’ whatever we want 
This is our house, this is our rules 
And we can’t stop, and we won’t stop 
Can’t you see it’s we who own the night? 
Can’t you see it’s we who ’bout that life? 
And we can’t stop, and we won’t stop 
We run things, things don’t run we 
We don’t take nothing from nobody, yeah yeah 

It’s our party we can do what we want, 
It’s our party we can say what we want 
It’s our party we can love who we want 
We can kiss who we want 
We can live how we want 

It’s our party we can do what we want to 
It’s our house we can love who we want to 
It’s our song we can sing if we want to 
It’s my mouth I can say what I want to 

And we can’t stop, and we won’t stop 
Can’t you see it’s we who own the night? 
Can’t you see it’s we who ’bout that life? 
And we can’t stop, and we won’t stop 
We run things, things don’t run we 
We don’t take nothing from nobody, yeah yeah
