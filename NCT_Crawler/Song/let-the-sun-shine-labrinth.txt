                        I feel a cold flush going through my hair
 and hey you know what
 I don't even care
 The time has passed me by
 Its gone with the wind
 Its all because the sun shined once again
 Now the party's on
 Everybody's there
 And if you don't know anyone
 You'll still meet some new friends
 That's the way it is
 When i have myself a drink
 All because the sun shines once again Let the sunshine
 Let the sunshine baby
 Let it all go
 Let it all go baby
 Let the sunshine
 Let the sunshine baby
 Let it all go
 Let it all go baby So turn the lights off
 Ain't no one afraid
 When the night comes
 It'll be just like the day
 And without the day light
 I am glowing from within
 All because the sun shined once again
 So play that sweet tune
 Play it through the air
 And the volume
 Raise it up
 Don't you ask me twice
 You know i'm gonna bid
 All because the sun shined once again Let the sunshine
 Let the sun shine baby
 Let it all go
 Let it all go baby
 Let the sun shine
 Let the sun shine baby
 Let it all go
 Let it all go baby I know that the world is gonna smile again
 When we go from the darkness into the light
 Ohhh Let the sunshine
 Let the sunshine
 Let the sunshine
 Let the sunshine baby
 Let it all go
 Let it all go baby
 Let the sunshine
 Let the sunshine baby
 Let it all go
 Let it all go baby (x2)
 Let the sunshine yeah eh eyy yeah
