                        You seem to replace 
Your brain with your heart 
You take things so hard 
Then you fall apart 

You try to explain 
But before you can start 
Those cry baby tears 
Come out of the dark 

Something's turning the handle 
To that faucet in your eyes 
They're pouring out 
Where everyone can see them 

Your heart's too big for your body 
It's where your feelings hide 
They're pouring out 
Where everyone can see 

They call you cry baby 
Cry baby 
But you don't *** care 
Cry baby, cry baby 
So you laugh through your tears 

Cry baby, cry baby 
Cause you don't *** care 
Tears fall to the ground 
You just let them drown 

You're all on your own and 
You lost all your friends 
You told yourself that 
It's not you, it's them 

You're one of a kind 
And no one understands 
But those cry baby tears 
Keep coming back again 

Something's turning the handle 
To that faucet in your eyes 
They're pouring out 
Where everyone can see them 

Your heart's too big for your body 
It's where your feelings hide 
They're pouring out 
Where everyone can see 

They call you cry baby 
Cry baby 
But you don't *** care 
Cry baby, cry baby 
So you laugh through your tears 

Cry baby, cry baby 
Cause you don't *** care 
Tears fall to the ground 
You just let them drown 

I look at you and 
I see myself 
I know you better 
Than anyone else 

I have same the faucet 
In my eyes 
So your tears 
Are mine 

They call me cry baby 
Cry baby 
But I don't *** care 
Cry baby, cry baby 
So I laugh through my tears 

Cry baby, cry baby 
Cause I don't *** care 
Tears fall to the ground 
I just let them drown 
I just let them drown 
Cry baby, cry baby
