                        [Chorus 1]
 Oh oh oh oh
 Oh oh oh oh
 Wa aoh oh ooh
 Oh oh oh oh
 Oh oh oh oh
 Wa aoh oh ooh [Verse 1]
 Life's just a pace-car on death
 Only less diligent
 And when the two collide
 It's no coincidence
 The lights are on and everybody's home
 The only thing suicidal here is the doors
 We had a good run
 Even I have to admit
 Life's just a pace-car on death
 Only less diligent [Chorus 2]
 Hell or glory
 I don't want anything in between
 Then came a baby boy with long eyelashes
 And daddy said "you gotta show the world the thunder"
 Woah oh oh
 The thunder
 Woah oh oh
 The thunder
 Woah oh oh
 The thunder [Chorus 1] [Verse 2]
 We didn't come to compete
 This is a demonstration
 Even the young ones become irrelevant
 They always bring up how you've changed
 Never the same person when I go to sleep
 As when I wake up
 As when I wake up
 Bop bop ba dop
 Ba dop op ba dop
 Ba dop op ba dop
 Ba dop op ba dop [Chorus 2]
 Hell or glory
 I don't want anything in between
 Then came a baby boy with long eyelashes
 And daddy said "you gotta show the world the thunder"
 Woah oh oh
 The thunder
 Woah oh oh
 The thunder
 Woah oh oh
 The thunder
 Woah oh oh [Chorus 1] [Chorus 2]
 Hell or glory
 I don't want anything in between
 Then came a baby boy with long eyelashes
 And daddy said "you gotta show the world the thunder"
 Woah oh oh
 The thunder
 Woah oh oh
 The thunder
 Woah oh oh
 The thunder [Outro]
 Woah oh oh
 He said "bring the thunder!"
 Woah oh oh
 The thunder
 Woah oh oh
 The thunder
 Woah oh oh oh oh
                        
                    |
