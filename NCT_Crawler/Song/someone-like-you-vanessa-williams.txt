                        I've been searching a long time
 For someone exactly like you
 I've been travelin' all around the world
 Waiting for you to come through Someone like you makes it all worthwhile
 Someone like you keeps me satisfied
 Someone exactly like you I've been travelin' a hard road baby
 Lookin' for someone exactly like you now, now
 I've been carryin a heavy load
 Waitin' for the light to come shinin' through Someone like you makes it all worthwhile
 Someone like you keeps me satisfied
 Someone exactly like you, someone exactly like you I've been doin' some soul searchin'
 To find out where you're at
 I've been up and down the highway
 In all kinds of foreign lands I've been all around the world
 Marchin' to the beat of a different drum
 And just lately I've realized
 Baby the best is yet to come Someone like you makes it all worthwhile
 Well someone like you keep me satisfied
 Someone exactly like you make it all worthwhile
 Someone like you now keep me satisfied
 Someone exactly like you Exactly like you
 Yeah, someone exactly like you now
 Oh baby, the best is yet to come
 Baby, the best is yet to come
 Ohh, exactly like you now Someone someone cares in my life
