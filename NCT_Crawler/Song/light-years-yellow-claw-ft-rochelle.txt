                        Bài hát: Light Years - Yellow Claw, Rochelle

[Verse 1: Rochelle]
Electric nights, like fireflies
Time is frozen
Velvet skies, like lightning vibes
We be floating

[Pre-Chorus: Rochelle]
'Cause when you touch me, I swear I can't speak
Out of body, there ain't no coming back
And when you touch me, it's what my heart needs
And we can run free, I know that

[Chorus: Rochelle]
We can be light years away
I know I can find you
We can be light years away
I know we can shine through
Anywhere, anywhere, anywhere
I know I can find you
Anywhere, anywhere, anywhere
I know we can shine through

[Drop]
Yellow motherfucking Claw

[Verse 2: Rochelle]
Worlds apart, we're shooting stars
Skies are open
A ray of sparks, our beating hearts
Throw us in motion

[Pre-Chorus: Rochelle]
'Cause when you touch me, I swear I can't speak
Out of body, there ain't no coming back
And when you touch me, it's what my heart needs
And we can run free, I know that

[Chorus: Rochelle]
We can be light years away
I know I can find you
We can be light years away
I know we can shine through
Anywhere, anywhere, anywhere
I know I can find you
Anywhere, anywhere, anywhere
I know we can shine through

[Drop]
Yellow motherfucking Claw

[Outro: Rochelle]
Be-be, be-be, be-be, be-be
Be-be, be-be, be-be, be-be
Be-be, be-be, be-be, be-be
Be-be, be-be, be-be, be-be
                        
                    |
