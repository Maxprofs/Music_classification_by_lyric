                        Looking at a sleeping town
As the world goes round and round
Sitting here on my own
As a king that lost his throne
We were so in harmony
But now it is a different key
Wonder if you played your game
For some 15 minutes of fame
Oh...
I walk this road alone
Oh...
Will I find another home
Pushing everything aside
Jumping on to your ride
Waiting for you at your door
Loving you more and more
I couldn't tell the truth from fake
And that was a big mistake
Gave you everything I had
And you treated me so bad
Oh...
I walk this road alone
Oh...
Will I find another home
Looking at a sleeping town
As the world goes round and round
Sitting here on my own
As a king that lost his throne
We were so in harmony
But now it is a different key
Wonder if you played your game
For some 15 minutes of fame
Oh...
I walk this road alone
Oh...
Will I find another home
Oh...
I walk this road alone
Oh...
Will I find another home
Oh...
I walk this road alone
Oh...
Will I find another home
I walk this road along
Will I find another home
