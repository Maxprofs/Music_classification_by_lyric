                        You went down one of those roads
 Nobody should have to go
 Life sure got real, real fast
 You couldn't see your way out
 Your world was under a cloud
 All you could feel was helpless
 You didn't think you could do it
 Oh but you got through it chorus: You kept faith when you didn't have a prayer
 Found hope when it wasn't even there
 Up against the impossible you
 just wouldn't back down
 You kept fighting
 That heavy cross you carried
 Ain't weighing you down any longer
 Life is tough
 But love is stronger You're finally facing the sun
 Your brighter days have begun
 Look at you now, just soaking it in
 You're smiling, you're laughing
 You're happy, you're living
 Every moment surrounded by
 All the beautiful reasons why Repeat Chorus Twice
