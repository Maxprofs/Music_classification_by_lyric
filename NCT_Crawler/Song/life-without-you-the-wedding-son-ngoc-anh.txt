Trữ Tình|

                        Every morning sunlight greet me
Wake up wake up, just for you
Hands on my heart beast so wildly
I shout, love you through and through
Time spent with you, it was my first
Nothing, nothing, I wouldn’t do
Embrace, embrave, your 3 words
Say I do, I do love you.

Life without you, no rainbow
No tender touch, my hands cold
Can’t hear your voice, songs no rythm
Love means all things for all time

Say you’ll be mine, one more time
Your heart has shine, from within
This song I sing, is who I am
Love is for life, a journey
Lets us begin.
