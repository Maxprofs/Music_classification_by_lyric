                        Bài hát : Dreaming Of New Zealand - André Rieu, Hayley Westenra

Dreaming Of New Zealand
Dreaming of New Zealand
Far across the sea
I feel my loved one
Staying nearer to me

Te Ika-a-maui [the fish of Maui]
Te Wai Pounamu [The waters of greenstone]
Sweet sounds of Maori
Remind me just of you

Kei Te aroha au ki a koe
You whispered I love you
Sweet sounds of Maori
Brought me close to you

Walking by the seaside
The ocean deep and blue
An albatross flying over
The moment I met you

We climbed upon the highcliffs
A path we'd never gone
Standing close together
We saw the golden sun

Dreaming of New Zealand
Far across the sea
I feel my loved one
Staying nearer to me

Kei te aroha au ki a koe [I love you]
You whispered I love you
Aoteraroa [Land of the long white cloud]
Reminds me just of you
                        
                    |
