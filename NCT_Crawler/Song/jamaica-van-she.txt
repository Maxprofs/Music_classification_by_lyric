                        We are just all animals
 Eating food, making love to the music of life
 Hanging around with your friends at night
 Friends you call your friends and people that you see through the night Oh oh woah, walking around town
 Thinking of all those things you made
 Oh oh woah, no place we can go
 To make it all disappear Jamaica! The lights are off
 You will be dancing strong, you know it!
 Jamaica! The lights are off
 You will be dancing strong, you know it! And the second you know your part
 Makes it easy for us to let go of all the people we depend on
 Northern lights so we remember sun
 Never came open until we left Oh oh woah, walking around town
 Thinking of all those things you made
 Oh oh woah, no place we can go
 To make it all disappear Jamaica! The lights are off
 You will be dancing strong, you know it!
 Jamaica! The lights are off
 You will be dancing strong, you know it!
 [x2] You know it!
 Jamaica! Jamaica! The lights are off
 Jamaica! You will be dancing strong!
