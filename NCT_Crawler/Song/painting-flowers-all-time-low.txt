                        Strange maze, what is this place?
 I hear voices over my shoulder
 Nothing's making sense at all
 Wonder, why do we race? When everyday we're runnin' in circles
 Such a funny way to fall
 Tried to open up my eyes
 I'm hopin' for a chance to make it alright When I wake up, the dream isn't done
 I wanna see your face and know I made it home
 If nothing is true, what more can I do?
 I am still painting flowers for you Show my cards, gave you my heart
 Wish we could start all over
 Nothing's makin' sense at all
 Tried to open up my eyes
 I'm hopin' for a chance to make it alright When I wake up, the dream isn't done
 I wanna see your face and know I made it home
 If nothing is true, what more can I do?
 I am still painting flowers for you
 I am still painting flowers for you I heard everything you said
 I don't wanna lose my head When I wake up, the dream isn't done
 I wanna see your face and know I made it home
 If nothing is true, what more can I do?
 I am still painting flowers for you
 I am still painting flowers for you
 I am still painting flowers for you
