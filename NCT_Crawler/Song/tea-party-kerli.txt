                        (Chorus 1):
 Welcome to the Tea Party
 Want to be my VIP?
 Didn't RSVP?
 That's okay (That's okay)
 Welcome to the Tea Party
 oh oh oh oh
 Want to be my VIP?
 When I'm all steamed up (up)
 Hear me shout
 Tip me over and pour me out Your appetite is flex
 I got the table set
 Don't get your dribble on my t-t-t-table yet I got the goodies baked
 Got more than you can take
 Just try and nibble on my biscuits and rainbow cakes Let's be traditional
 And non-commissional
 Elbows down (down) pinkies up (up)
 That's the way you sip my cup (Chorus 2):
 Welcome to the Tea Party
 oh oh oh oh
 Want to be my VIP?
 oh oh oh oh
 You didn't RSVP?
 oh oh oh oh
 That's okay That's okay
 oh oh oh oh
 Welcome to the Tea Party
 oh oh oh oh
 Want to be my VIP?
 When I'm all steamed up
 Hear me shout
 Tip me over and pour me out Try not to move so fast
 You know dessert comes !LAST!
 I'm a !LADY! FUTHAH MUCKAH!
 Try to show some class Down to the last cup
 We keep it boiling hot
 We keep the party moving till we drink the last drop Let's be traditional
 And non-commissional
 Elbows down (down) pinkies up (up)
 That's the way you sip my cup (my cup) (Chorus 2):
 Welcome to the Tea Party
 oh oh oh oh
 Want to be my VIP?
 oh oh oh oh
 You didn't RSVP?
 oh oh oh oh
 That's okay That's okay
 oh oh oh oh
 Welcome to the Tea Party
 oh oh oh oh
 Want to be my VIP?
 When I'm all steamed up
 Hear me shout
 Tip me over and pour me out I know this night is like no other
 Your not just another (pour me out) I know it's only getting better
 As long as we're together (pour me out) I know this night is like no other
 Your not just another (Chorus 2):
 Welcome to the Tea Party

 Welcome to the Tea Party
