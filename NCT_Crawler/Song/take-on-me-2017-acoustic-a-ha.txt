                        Bài hát: Take On Me (2017 Acoustic) - a-ha

[Verse 1]
We're talking away
I don't know what I'm to say
I'll say it anyway
Today's another day to find you
Shying away
I'll be coming for your love, OK?

[Chorus]
Take on me (take on me)
Take me on (take on me)
I'll be gone
In a day or two

[Verse 2]
So needless to say
Of odds and ends
But I'll be stumbling away
Slowly learning that life is ok
Say after me
It's no better to be safe than sorry

[Chorus]
Take on me (take on me)
Take me on (take on me)
I'll be gone
In a day or two

[Verse 3]
Oh, things that you say
Is it a life or just to play my worries away
You're all the things I've got to remember
You're shying away
I'll be coming for you anyway

[Outro]
Take on me (take on me)
Take me on (take on me)
I'll be gone
In a day or two
Take on me (take on me)
Take me on (take on me)
I'll be gone
In a day
                        
                    |
