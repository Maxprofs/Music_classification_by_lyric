Melao,Melao Melao Melao

Emmanuel thinks about the girl He knows all too well She's got him a tangle
And she's got him in her spell 

She dances with his mind And she dances on the floor And she knows how to drive him So lo-co!

Corazon De Melao, Melao Melao Melao Corazon De
Melao,Melao Melao Melao

(ad lib - passing chord: so she goes)

Emmanuel knows she's trouble But what else can he do 

She's got him'round his finger With her different points of view
She can dance away her troubles 

She's danced into his life She got him working hard for her all night!

Corazon De Melao, Melao Melao Melao Corazon De
Melao,Melao Melao Melao

Emmanuel seen it all But not like this before A girl who turns up the heat By walking through the door 

And when she hits the dancing floor She burns up all the lights 

She's the one and only one thing in his sight

Emmanuel just doesn't know Where this all is gonna lead

He only knows what he wants And what he really needs He needs to know What makes her tick And all her other
games He knows no other woman Be the same
