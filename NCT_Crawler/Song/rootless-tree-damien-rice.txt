Title: Rootless Tree
Artist: Damien Rice

What I want from you
Is empty your head
They say be true
Don't stain your bed
We do what we need to be free
And it leans on me
Like a rootless tree
What I want from us
Is empty our minds
We fake a fuss
And fracture the times
We go blind
When we've needed to see
And it leans on me
Like a rootless...
So *** you, *** you, *** you
And all we've been through
I said leave it, leave it, leave it
It's nothing to you
And if you hate me, hate me, hate me
Then hate me so good 
That you can let me out
Let me out 
Let me out of this hell 
When you're around
Let me out, let me out,
Let me out of this hell when you're around
Let me out, let me out
Let me out

What I want from this
Is learn to let go
No not of you
Of all that's been told
Killers reinvent and believe
And this leans on me
Like a rootless...

So *** you, *** you, *** you
And all we've been through
I said leave it, leave it, leave it,
It's nothing to you
And if you hate me, hate me , hate me,
Then hate me so good 
That you can let me out,
Let me out
Let me out of this hell when you're around
Let me out, let me out
Let me out of this hell when you're around
And *** you, *** you, *** you
And all we've been through
I said leave it, leave it, leave it
It's nothing to you
And if you hate me, hate me, hate me
Then hate me so good 
That you can let me out
Let me out, let me out, let me out,
Hell when you're around...
