                        Bài hát: Beautiful In White - Hoàng Cường (Pianist)

Not sure if you know this 
But when we first met 
I got so nervous I couldn't speak 
In that very moment 
I found the one and 
My life had found its missing piece 

So as long as I live I love you 
Will heaven hold you? 
You look so beautiful in white 
And from now till my very last breath 
This day I'll cherish 
You look so beautiful in white 
Tonight 

What we have is timeless 
My love is endless 
And with this ring I 
Say to the world 
You're my every reason you're all that I believe in 
With all my heart I mean every word 

So as long as I live I love you 
Will heaven hold you? 
You look so beautiful in white 
And from now till my very last breath 
This day I'll cherish 
You look so beautiful in white 
Tonight 

oooh oh 
You look so beautiful in white 

nah nah nah nah~ 
So beautiful in white 
Tonight 

And if a daughter's what our future holds 
I hope she has your eyes 
Finds love like you and I did 
Yeah, we wish she falls in love, we'll let her go 
I'll walk her down the aisle 
She'll look so beautiful in white 

You look so beautiful in white 

So as long as I live I love you 
Will heaven hold you? 
You look so beautiful in white 
And from now till my very last breath 
This day I'll cherish 
You look so beautiful in white 
Tonight 

You look so beautiful in white 
Tonight
