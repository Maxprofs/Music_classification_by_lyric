                        Bài hát: Nutbush City Limits (Glee Cast Version) - Glee Cast

A church house gin house
A school house outhouse
On highway number nineteen
The people keep the city clean

They call it nutbush
Oh nutbush
They call it nutbush city limits
(nutbush city)

Twenty-five was the speed limit
Motorcycle not allowed in it
You go to the store on fridays
You go to church on sunday

They call it nutbush
Little ole town
Oh nutbush
Call it nutbush city limits
(nutbush city)

You go to the fields on weekdays
And have a picnic on labor day
You go to town on saturday
But go to the church ev'ry sunday

They call it nutbush
Oh nutbush
Call it nutbush city limits
(nutbush city)
Heyyyya

All right hey, hey ya
All yeh yeah 
Ha ha ha hey
Haaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaayyyyyy yaaaayya
(nutbush city limits)
Nutbush
Whooooooaaaa!

No whiskey for sale
You can't cop no bail
Salt pork and molasses
Is all you get in jail

They call it nutbush
Oh nutbush
Call it nutbush 
Nutbush city limitis
(nutbsh city)

Little old town in tennessee
That's called (nutbush city limits)
A quiet little old community
A one-horse town 
You have to watch
What you're puttin' down 

Nutbush city limits
Nutbush city
Oh nutbush
They call it nutbush
They call it nutbush city limits
                        
                    |
