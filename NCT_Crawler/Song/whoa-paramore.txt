[al:All We Know Is Falling]
Whoa
Paramore
All We Know Is Falling

I've hoped for change,
and it gets better everyday
I've hoped for change,
but still I feel the same

There's something wrong,
cause everybody knows
That we can do this on our own

And we've got everybody singing
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
We've got everybody singing
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa

We're doing fine
And it gets better everytime
We're doing fine
But I'll let you decide

There's something wrong,
cause everybody knows
That we can do this on our own

And we've got everybody singing
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
We've got everybody singing
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa

And I'll confess
That I can be a little selfish
And I'll admit
I don't want you to help me through this
I don't want to start over again
....

And we've got everybody singing
And we've got everybody singing
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
And we've got everybody singing
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa

And I'll confess
That I can be a little selfish, I can, I can
And I'll admit
I don't want you to help me through this
I don't want to start over again
