                        Bài hát: Youngblood - 5 Seconds Of Summer

Remember the words you told me, "Love me 'til the day I die"?
Surrender my everything 'cause you made me believe you’re mine
Yeah, you used to call me baby, now you're calling me by name
Takes one to know one, yeah, you beat me at my own damn game

[Bridge]
You’re pushing, you're pushing
I’m pulling away, pulling away from you
I give and I give and I give
And you take, give and you take

[Chorus]
Young blood
Say you want me, say you want me out of your life
And I’m just a dead man walking tonight
But you need it, yeah, you need it all of the time
Yeah, ooh, ooh, ooh
Young blood
Say you want me, say you want me back in your life
So I’m just a dead man crawling tonight
'Cause I need it, yeah, I need it all of the time
Yeah, ooh, ooh, ooh

[Verse 2]
Lately, our conversations end like it’s the last goodbye
Yeah, one of us gets too drunk and calls about a hundred times
So who you been calling, baby? Nobody could take my place
When you looking at those strangers, hope to God you see my face


[Chorus]
Young blood
Say you want me, say you want me out of your life
And I’m just a dead man walking tonight
But you need it, yeah, you need it all of the time
Yeah, ooh, ooh, ooh
Young blood
Say you want me, say you want me back in your life
So I’m just a dead man crawling tonight
'Cause I need it, yeah, I need it all of the time
Yeah, ooh, ooh, ooh

[Bridge]
You’re pushing, you're pushing
I’m pulling away, pulling away from you
I give and I give and I give
And you take, give and you take
You’re running around and I’m running away
Running away from you, from you

[Chorus]
Young blood
Say you want me, say you want me out of your life
And I’m just a dead man walking tonight
But you need it, yeah, you need it all of the time
Yeah, ooh, ooh, ooh
Young blood
Say you want me, say you want me back in your life
So I’m just a dead man crawling tonight
'Cause I need it, yeah, I need it all of the time
Yeah, ooh, ooh, ooh


[Bridge]
You’re pushing, you're pushing
I’m pulling away, pulling away from you
I give and I give and I give
And you take, give and you take

[Outro]
Young blood
Say you want me, say you want me out of your life
And I’m just a dead man walking tonight
