                        For too long now
 There were secrets in my mind
 For too long now
 There were things I should have said
 In the darkness
 I was stumbling for the door
 To find a reason
 To find the time, the place, the hour Waiting for the winter sun
 And the cold light of day
 The misty ghosts of childhood fears
 The pressure is building and I can't stay away I throw myself into the sea
 Release the wave let it wash over me
 To face the fear I once believed
 The tears of the dragon for you and for me Where I was
 I had wings that couldn't fly
 Where I was
 I had tears I couldn't cry
 My emotions frozen in an icy lake
 I couldn't feel them until the ice began to break
 I have no power over this
 You know I'm afraid
 The walls I built are crumbling
 The water is moving
 I'm slipping away I throw myself into the sea
 Release the wave let it wash over me
 To face the fear I once believed
 The tears of the dragon for you and for me Slowly I awake
 Slowly I rise
 The walls I built are crumbling
 The water is moving
 I'm slipping away I throw
 (I throw)
 Myself
 (Myself)
 Into the sea
 Release the wave let it wash over me
 To face
 (To face)
 The fear
 (The fear)
 I once believed
 The tears of the dragon for you and for me I throw
 (I throw)
 Myself
 (Myself)
 Into the sea
 Release the wave let it wash over me
 To face
 (To face)
 The fear
 (The fear)
 I once believed
 The tears of the dragon for you and for me
                        
                    |
