She's moving up, down, all around
She's moving up, down, all around
(Bounce bounce bounce)
She's moving up, down, all around
She's moving up, down, all around
(Bounce bounce bounce)
She's moving up, down, all around
She's moving up, down, all around
(Bounce bounce bounce)

Yeah!
Tonight I've got a party to throw
At the party Rocnation gon' be nothing for sure
Yeah, me and my crew feeling restless
We need some good booty on the guest list
First stop is the gas station, I like to call it the ass station
I always see girls bumping it up, I see them stumble on up
I say Whassup! and ask questions
Excuse me, what you're doing tonight?!
I got a party at my crib, I'm picking you to invite
Uh, she got a booty that's out of frame
I nicked named it high octane,
I made her laugh, told her some of that
And in a flash, we walked away with the math
Next stop, whole foods,
Me and the crew we call it hoe foods
It be cracking on the weekend,
The only place you could find a big booty on the vegan
Her name was Shelly, tattoos and a ring on her belly
The only problems that her arms were smelly
Didn't matter to me, *** that jelly

I'm a booty man, booty man, booty man
I'm a booty man, booty man, booty man
I'm a booty man, booty man, booty man
I'm a booty man, booty man, booty man

She's moving up, down, all around
She's moving up, down, all around
(Bounce bounce bounce)
She's moving up, down, all around
She's moving up, down, all around
(Bounce bounce bounce)
