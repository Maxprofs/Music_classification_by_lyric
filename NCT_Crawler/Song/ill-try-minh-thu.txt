                        Bài hát: I'Ll Try - Minh Thư

Don't, don't you feel? Don't you see the love in me
Please, show me how, tell me why, you lied to me.

I want you to come back, to come back
The love that we had was so strong
Boy, you don't leave me, don't leave me
I'll try all my best to have you.

If you stay here with me spending the night
Holding me tight till the day starts
I'm waiting, i'm falling in the dark of my silence, memories's gone.

I want you to come back, to come back
The love that we had was so strong
Boy, you don't leave me, don't leave me
I'll try all my best to have you.

Don't, don't you feel? Don't you see the love in me
Please, show me how, tell me why, you lied to me.

I want you to come back, to come back
The love that we had was so strong
Boy, you don't leave me, don't leave me
I'll try all my best to have you.

If you stay here with me spending the night
Holding me tight till the day starts
I'm waiting, i'm falling in the dark of my silence, memories's gone.

I want you to come back, to come back
The love that we had was so strong
Boy, you don't leave me, don't leave me
I'll try all my best to have you.

I want you to come back, to come back
The love that we had was so strong
Boy, you don't leave me, don't leave me
I'll try all my best to have you
I'll try
I'll try...
