                        I look around me
But all I seem to see
Is people going nowhere
Expecting sympathy
It?s like we?re going through the motions
Of the scripted destiny
Tell me where?s our inspiration
If life wont wait
I guess it?s up to me

Whoahh
No we?re not gonna waste another moment in this town
Whoahh
We wont come back, the world its calling out
Whoahh
Leave the past in the past gonna find the future
And misery loves company
Well so long
You?ll miss me when I?m gone
You?re gonna miss me when I?m gone

Procrastination running circles in my head
While you sit there contemplating you?ll wind up left for dead (left for dead)
Life is what happens
While you?re busy making your excuses
Another day, another casualty
But that won?t happen to me

Whoahh
No we?re not gonna waste another moment in this town
Whoahh
We wont come back, the world its calling out
Whoahh
Leave the past in the past gonna find the future
And misery loves company
Well so long
You?ll miss me when I?m gone
You?re gonna miss me when I?m gone
You?re gonna miss me when I?m gone
When I?m gone

Let?s go?!
Won?t look back
When I say goodbye
We?re gonna leave this world behind me
Gonna take what?s mine tonight
?cause every wasted day
Becomes a wasted chance
You?re gonna wake up feeling sorry
?cause life won?t wait
I guess it?s up to you

Whoahh
No we?re not gonna waste another moment in this town
Whoahh
We wont come back, the world its calling out
Whoahh
Leave the past in the past gonna find the future
And misery loves company
Well so long
You?ll miss me when I?m gone
You?re gonna miss me when I?m gone
You?re gonna miss me when I?m gone
You?re gonna miss me when I?m gone
You?re gonna miss me when I?m gone
