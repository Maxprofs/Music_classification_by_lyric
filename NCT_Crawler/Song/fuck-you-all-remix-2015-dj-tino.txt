                        Bài hát: *** You All (Remix 2015) - Dj Tino

Refrain:
*** you all, you little asses, *** you all, you make me sick (2x)
Tired of the *** that I learned from the school 
Tired of the things that I don't wanna do 
Pissed by the *** people want me to 
I miss all the things that I used to do 
Why don't you asses not just leave 
Set me free just let me be 
That's just me how I really wanna be 
Excuse me, I see I'm dealin with another ***ing wannabe 
You're trippin', you're gettin' on my nerves 
Now I really knows what it takes to win a persons spurse 
Too many haters all around and too much curse 
It stinks!
what you do is right, what I do is wrong?!
I don't give a *** I just keep goin' on!
My tongue is active, my *** is progressive 
I'm massive aggressive, for you too expensive 
gotta stay passive all that you do is annoying
You should find another employment
lookin' at me, all you see is a foreigner 
Just another alien, I'ma be the reason for this rebellion 
Refrain:
*** you all, you little asses, *** you all, you make me sick (4x)
(*** You)
I do see a lot of wannabees in the club 
A lot of son of guns like Geeez smokin' pot 
A lot of mamas and sisters they're shakin' around their butts 
And me in the middle of a little ***ty club 
I'm laughin' at those people how you're tryin' to get a hug 
Even when I come around is just like what's up 
There are superficial people all around what the *** 
Your life is just a cent I'm about a buck 
Me and my dude Duane rollin' in the subway 
We don't give a *** about it is really ok 
We are damn sure next day sex play is guaranteed 
And everybody in the club wanna get to know me as a homie want's to show me what he
can I don't wanna burn 
I ain't concerned I never maintain there is nothing for me to learn 
you might be jealous fellows and that's a real fact
Refrain:
*** you all, you little asses, *** you all, you make me sick (2x)
Just take a look at society everybody's walkin' like a VIP 
Boys at the bar full of Bacardi chicks in the club on exstacy 
Dressed up ***ty like a blond Barbie isn't it scary 
But where's your man, ahh, sorry, isn't it Ken 
The man who carries you on his hands to wonderland 
To the Never Neverland, hmm strange, how did it come so far 
All I hear is blablabla, I wanna be this I wanna be that 
I wanna be a superstar 
Germany is searching on TV kids at the age of ten to thirty 
Isn't it dirty??? 
Refrain:
*** you all, you little asses, *** you all, you make me sick (4x)
Hey ya man don't take it personnel
Just think about want I'm try'nna tell ya
Try to be an inovator, man
Don't try to be someone else,
Try to be Yourself!
OK?
Peace,I'm out! 
Ha! *** YOU!
