[Troy]
Once in a lifetime
means there’s no second chance
so I believe than you and me
should grab it while we can

[Gabriella]
Make it last forever
and never give it back

[Troy]
It’s our turn, and I’m loving where we’re at

[Troy and Gabriella]
Because this moment’s really all we have

[Troy]
Everyday
of our lives,

[Gabriella]
Wanna find you there, wanna hold on tight

[Troy]
Gonna run

[Troy and Gabriella]
While we’re young
and keep the faith

[Troy]
Everyday

[Troy and Gabriella]
From right now,
gonna use our voices
and scream out loud

[Gabriella]
Take my hand;

[Troy]
together we
will celebrate,

[Gabriella]
celebrate.

[Troy and Gabriella]
Oh, everyday.

[Gabriella]
They say that you should follow

[Troy]
And chase down what you dream,

[Gabriella]
But if you get lost and lose yourself

[Troy]
What does is really mean?

[Gabriella]
No matter where we’re going,

[Troy]
It starts from where we are.

[Troy and Gabriella]
There’s more to life when we listen to our hearts

[Troy and Gabriella]
And because of you, I’ve got the strength to start

Yeah, yeah, yeah!
Everyday
of our lives,

[Troy and Gabriella]
Wanna find you there, wanna hold on tight

[Troy and Gabriella]
Gonna run
while we’re young
and keep the faith.
Everyday

[Troy]
From right now,
Gonna use our voices and scream out loud
Take my hand;
together we
will celebrate,

[Gabriella]
Oh, everyday

[Troy]
We’re taking it back,
we’re doing it here
together!

[Gabriella]
It’s better like that,
and stronger now
than ever!

[Troy and Gabriella]
We’re not gonna lose.
‘Cause we get to choose.
That’s how it’s gonna be!

[Troy]
Everyday
