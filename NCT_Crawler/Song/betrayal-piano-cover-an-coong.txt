                        Bài hát: Betrayal (Piano Cover) - An Coong

My love has gone away
Quietly after a hundred days. 
This is what's she has always said she won't stay 
For more than what she can repay. 

I can still hear her say there 
That I'm not hearing tender play 
The day she let me kiss her was a display
Of love to those who she betray. 

How can I put someone to the test
When I thought I got the best. 
Untill the taste of bitterness then I regret 
But still that I won't detest
The love I can't forget
Like someone who has left. 

How can i leave someone for the rest 
When i'm alone facing the best 
Untill they take some try to reason i regret 
But still that i won't detest 
Who i can never forget 
Like someone i once met
                        
                    |
