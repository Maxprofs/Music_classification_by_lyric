                        How did I get here?
I turned around
and there you were
I didn't think twice
Or rationalize
cause somehow I knew

That there was more
than just chemistry
I mean I knew you were
kinda of in to me
But I figured
it's too good to be true

I said pinch me
Where's the catch this time
Can't find a single cloud in the sky
Help me before I get used to this guy

[Chorus:]
They say that good things take time
But really great things
happen in a blink of an eye
Thought the chances to meet
somebody like you
were a million to one
I cannot believe it (o woah)
You're one in a million
All this time I was looking for love
Trying to make things work
They weren't good enough till
I thought I'm through
Said I'm done
and stumbled into the arms of the one

You're making me laugh about the silliest stuff
Say that I'm your diamond in the rough
When I'm mad at you
You come with your velvet touch
Can't believe that I'm so lucky
I have never felt so happy
Every time I see that sparkle in your eye

[Chorus]

I said pinch me
Where's the catch this time
Can't find a single cloud in the sky
Help me before I get used to this guy

(x2) They say that good things take time
But really great things
happen in a blink of an eye
Thought the chances
to meet somebody like you
were a million to one
I cannot believe it (o woah)

You're one in a million...
one in a million
you're one in a million...
                        
                    |
