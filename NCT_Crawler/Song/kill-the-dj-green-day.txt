                        Walking after dark
In the New York City park
Your thoughts are so unholy
In the holiest of holes
Onward Christian soldiers
Filled with jivin' mind control

The blood left on the dance floor
Runnin', runnin' red
The bullet that you asked for
Killing you to death
Unless you...

Someone kill the DJ, shoot the f*cking DJ
Someone kill the DJ, shoot the f*cking DJ
Someone kill the DJ, shoot the f*cking DJ
Voices in my head are saying,
"Shoot that f*cker down."

We are the vultures
The dirtiest kind
The culture war's
In your heart and your mind

Walking after dark
In the New York City park
Beer goggles left in the club
My pocket full of pills
Sodom and Gomorrah
In the century of thrills

The blood left on the dance floor
Runnin', runnin' red
The bullet that you asked for
Killing you to death
Unless you...

Someone kill the DJ, shoot the f*cking DJ
Someone kill the DJ, shoot the f*cking DJ
Someone kill the DJ, shoot the f*cking DJ
Hold him underwater
'Til the mother f*cker drowns

We are the vultures
The dirtiest kind
The culture war's
In your heart and your mind

Someone's gonna get you boy
Shoot that f*cker down

Someone kill the DJ, shoot the f*cking DJ
Someone kill the DJ, shoot the f*cking DJ
Someone kill the DJ, shoot the f*cking DJ (Walking after dark)
Someone kill the DJ, shoot the f*cking DJ (Walking after dark)
Someone kill the DJ, shoot that f*cker down (Walking after dark)

Someone kill the DJ, shoot the f*cking DJ
Someone kill the DJ, shoot the f*cking DJ
Someone kill the DJ, shoot the f*cking DJ
Voices in my head are saying
"Shoot that f*cker down"
