                        Did you think that you can get me, boy? (no)
 Think again, babe.
 Thought you could buy me for a drink or two,
 But I'm not that easy You saw me chattin' with my girls at bar (true)
 We're all pretty
 You told me I look like a movie star,
 But I'm not naive So... I'm gonna make you, make you fall,
 down do-do-down down on your knees.
 I'm gonna make you,
 make you fall down to get all... Attention, a little care
 Then you can have a love love love love, some love
 Attention, a little care,
 And you can have lots of love Do you dream abourt me in your bed?
 Keep on dreamin'
 You thought I'd give it to you - all I have (wait)
 Not the first night You said that it might be the love at first sight (babe)
 Hold your horses
 You told me you're the best I'll ever have,
 But I just don't believe I'm not gonna ask you buy me diamonds,
 no no no no,
 Just behave yourself, treat me very well,
 give me some: Attention, a little care
 Then you can have a love love love love, some love
 Attention, a little care,
 And you can have lots of love.
