                        Bài hát: Heart Vacancy - The Wanted

(Max)
Whoa...
I hear your heart cry for love, but you won't let me make it right,
You were hurt, but I decided that you were worth the fight,
Every night, you lock up; you won't let me come inside,
But the look in your eyes, I can turn the tide.
In your heart, in your heart, in your heart,
I can tell you can fit one more,
In your heart, in your heart, in your heart,
I don't care who was there before.
(All)
I hear your heart cry for love, then you act like there's no room,
Room for me, or anyone, Dont disturb" is all I see,
Close the door; turn the key on everything that we could be,
If loneliness would move out, I'd fill the vacancy.
In your heart, in your heart, in your heart,
Ooh....
In your heart, in your heart, in your heart,
Ooh....
(Tom)
This ain't the Heartbreak Hotel, even though I know it well,
Those no shows, they sure tell, in the way you hold yourself,
(Tom & Jay)
Don't you fret, should you get another cancellation,
Give me a chance I'd make a permanent reservation.
(Max)
In your heart, in your heart, in your heart,
I can tell you can fit one more,
Open up make a brand new start,
I don't care who's stayed before.
(All)
I hear your heart cry for love, then you act like there's no room,
Room for me, or anyone, Don't disturb" is all I see,
Close the door; turn the key on everything that we could be,
If loneliness would move out, I'd fill the vacancy.
In your heart, in your heart, in your heart,
Ooh...
In your heart, in your heart, in your heart,
Ooh...
(Jay)
When I talk to you on the phone,
Listen close.
(All)
I hear your heart cry for love, then you act like there's no room,
Room for me, or anyone, Don't disturb" is all I see,
Close the door; turn the key on everything that we could be,
If loneliness would move out, Id fill the vacancy.
In your heart, in your heart, in your heart,
Ooh...
In your heart, in your heart, in your heart,
Ooh...
