Do we fight to hold our heads up high
And beat the drum to what we love?

Risk the fall, oh we have felt it all
Come crashing down from far above

Stars arising, countless worlds colliding
Only one will take it all

Can we bring to fall the giants
Can we make the final call

We are the ones
To ignite the darkened skies

The champions
Of a world that we defy

A solemn reign
Of the few who rise up high

And we all fight
At the last light

Hearing voices from afar
Join the madness when the curtain falls

Risk it all, hold nothing back
Seize the day, we must attack

Stars arising, countless worlds colliding
Only one will take it all

Can we bring to fall the giants
Can we make the final call

We are the ones
To ignite the darkened skies

The champions
Of a world that we defy
A solemn reign
Of the few who rise up high
And we all fight
At the last light
Can we bring to fall the giants
We are the ones
To ignite the darkened skies
The champions
Of a world that we defy
A solemn reign
Of the few who rise up high
And we all fight
At the last light
                        
                    |
