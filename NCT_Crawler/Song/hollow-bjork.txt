                        Hollow, my ancestors have access
 Hollow, I'm falling down the abyss
 Hollow, looking for some answers Generations of mothers sailing in
 Somehow they all were ship folks
 Hollow, the ground is opening up
 Swallows me up, the trunk of DNA
 (The trunk of DNA, trunk) Come forth, all species
 Hollow like a bead in necklace
 Thread me upon this chain
 I'm part of it, oh
 The everlasting necklace Jewels after jewels after jewels after
 Jewels after jewels after jewels I yearn to belong
 Let me belong
 Let me belong
                        
                    |
