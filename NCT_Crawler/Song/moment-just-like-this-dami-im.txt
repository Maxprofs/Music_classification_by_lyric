                        Bài hát: Moment Just Like This - Dami Im

You're looking straight into my eyes
I see you standing over there
I take it step by step into your arms
Like I'm under a spell!
And when the angels start to sing
To let our fairytale begin
We danced together all night long
Like time is standing still

I don't want to lose it now
I don't want this world to stop right now
All my life I've been waiting for
A moment just like this!
Whoaaa-oooh oh oh ooh oh
Whoaaa-oooh oh oh ooh oh
All my life I've been waiting for
A moment just like this!

Don't wake me up if I'm dreaming
Don't ever take it away
Wanna lose myself to every second of this
And I pray that it never ends!
Just let the crowds keep on un-folding
Let all the sparks light up the sky
And let's pretend like there's no tomorrow,
Surrender to this night!

I don't want to lose it now,
I don't want this world to stop right now
All my life I've been waiting for
A moment just like this!
Whoaaa-oooh oh oh ooh oh
Whoaaa-oooh oh oh ooh oh
All my life I've been waiting for
A moment just like this!

Uuuh uh uh, a moment just like this
Uuuh uh uh, a moment just like this
Ye-yeee yeah!

And for as long as I remember
My heart's been beating for this day
I think I'm nothing but love, sweet love sweet love
Flowing through my veins!

I don't want to lose it now
I don't want this world to stop right now
All my life I've been waiting for
A moment just like this!
Whoaaa-oooh oh oh ooh oh
Whoaaa-oooh oh oh ooh oh
All my life I've been waiting for
A moment just like this!
