                        [Verse 1]
 Robert's got a quick hand
 He'll look around the room, he won't tell you his plan
 He's got a rolled cigarette 
 Hanging out of his mouth, he's a cowboy kid
 He found a six-shooter gun
 In his dad's closet with in a box of fun things
 I don't even know what
 But he's coming for you, yeah he's coming for you

 [Hook]
 All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
 You'd better run, better run, outrun my gun
 All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
 You'd better run, better run, faster than my bullet
 All the other kids with the the pumped up kicks
 You'd better run, better run, outrun my gun
 All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
 You'd better run, better run, faster than my bullet

 [Verse 2]
 Daddy works a long day
 He'll be coming home late and he's coming home late
 And he's bringing me a surprise
 'Cause dinner's in the kitchen and it's packed in ice
 I've waited for a long time
 Yeah the slight of my hand is now a quick pull-trigger
 I reason with my cigarette
 And say, "your hair's on fire, you must've lost your wits, yeah"

 [Hook]
 All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
 You'd better run, better run, outrun my gun
 All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
 You'd better run, better run, faster than my bullet
 All the other kids with the the pumped up kicks
 You'd better run, better run, outrun my gun
 All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
 You'd better run, better run, faster than my bullet

 [Bridge]
 Run run run run
 Ru-ru-ru-run run run
 Ru-ru-ru-run run run run
 Ru-ru-ru-run run run ru-run run

 [Hook]
 All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
 You'd better run, better run, outrun my gun
 All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
 You'd better run, better run, faster than my bullet
 All the other kids with the the pumped up kicks
 You'd better run, better run, outrun my gun
 All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
 You'd better run, better run, faster than my bullet

 [Outro]
 All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
 You'd better run, better run, outrun my gun
 All the other kids with the pumped up kicks
 You'd better run, better run, faster than my bullet
