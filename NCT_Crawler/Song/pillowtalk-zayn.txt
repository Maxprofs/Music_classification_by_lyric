                        Bài hát: Pillowtalk - Zayn Malik

Climb on board
We’ll go slow and high-tempo
Light and dark
Hold me hard and mellow

I’m seeing the pain, seeing the pleasure
Nobody but you, ‘body but me, ‘body but us
Bodies together

I love to hold you close, tonight and always
I love to wake up next to you
I love to hold you close, tonight and always
I love to wake up next to you

So we’ll *** the neighbours
In the place that feels the tears
The place to lose your fears
Yeah, reckless behavior
Aplace that is so pure, so dirty and raw
Be in the bed all day, bed all day, bed all day
*** you and fighting on

It’t our paradise and it’s our war on
It’t our paradise and it’s our war on

Pillow talk
My enemy, my ally
Prisoner
There we’re free, it’s thriller

I love to hold you close, tonight and always
I love to wake up next to you

So we’ll *** the neighbours
In the place that feels the tears
The place to lose your fears
Yeah, reckless behavior
Aplace that is so pure, so dirty and raw
Be in the bed all day, bed all day, bed all day
*** you and fighting on

It’t our paradise and it’s our war on
It’t our paradise and it’s our war on

Paradise(*4)
War on(*4)
So we’ll *** the neighbours
In the place that feels the tears
The place to lose your fears
Yeah, reckless behavior
Aplace that is so pure, so dirty and raw
Be in the bed all day, bed all day, bed all day
*** you and fighting on

It’t our paradise and it’s our war on
It’t our paradise and it’s our war on
                        
                    |
