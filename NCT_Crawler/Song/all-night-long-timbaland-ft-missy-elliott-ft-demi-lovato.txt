I love the way you’re talking
I’m loving what you’re doing boy
I don’t fall easy often
I’ve never had a love like you before
I like you, put your number, put your number on my phone, phone, phone
You heard me wrestle, call me, call me when you’re all alone

Don’t make bets
Come on with me, we stay up all night long
I want you in, I want you bad
Let’s keep the party going all night long
Let’s keep the party going all night long
All night long, all night long, all night long

I’m on another planet
I made another universe
You may not understand it
Sooner or later baby you will learn
I like you, put your number, put your number in my phone, phone, phone
You heard me wrestle, call me, call me when you’re all alone

Don’t make bets
Come on with me we stay up all night long
I want you win, I want you bad
Let’s hit the party, going all night long
Let’s hit the party, going all night long
All night long, all night long, all night long

[Missy Eliott]
We could party all night night
Wanna spend a night, night
Will you be my type by the end of the night, we could pillow fight
Your missy’s real nice, come closer, cause I don’t bite
You talking how I like, you play diddy I play white
I’m so alone, no one is home
I got your number on my telephone
Wanna wanna wanna be your girl
Wanna wanna wanna be my babe
Boy we could hold hands...it’s the weekend don’t make plans
Welcome to ***

[Demi Lovato]
Party’s hot, when you’re here
At the club, we don’t care
We gon set it off, we gon set it off

Party’s hot, when you’re here
At the club, we don’t care
We gon set it off, we gon set it off

Don’t make bets
Come on with me, we stay up all night long
I want you in, I want you bad
Let’s keep the party going all night long
Let’s keep the party going all night long
All night long, all night long, all night long
