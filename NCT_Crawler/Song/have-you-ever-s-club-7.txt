                        Bài hát: Have You Ever - S Club 7

Sometimes it's wrong to walk away 
though you think it's over 
Knowing there's so much more to say 
Suddenly the moment's gone 
And all your dreams are upside down 
You just want to change the way the world goes round 

C: 
Tell me 
Have you ever loved and lost somebody 
Wished there was a chance to say I'm sorry 
Can't you see 
That's the way I feel, about you and me... baby 
Have you ever felt that your heart was breaking 
Looking down the road you should be taking 
I should know... 
cause I loved and lost the day I let you go 

Can't help but think that this is wrong, we should be together 
Back in your arms where I belong 
Now I've finally realised 
It was forever that I've found 
I'd give it all to change the way the world goes round 


ReC: ..v...v 

I really wanna hear you say that you know just how it feels 
To have it all and let it slip away, can't you see 
Even though the moments gone I'm still holding on somehow 
Wishing I could change the way the world goes round 

Tell me 
Have you ever loved and lost somebody 
Wished there was a chance to say I'm sorry 
Can't you see (oooOOoo) 
That's the way I feel, about you and me, baby 
Have you ever felt that your heart was breaking 
Looking down the road you should be taking i should know 
(I should know...) 
cause I loved and lost the day I let 
yes i loved to lost the day i let 
yes i loved to lost the day i let you go......
