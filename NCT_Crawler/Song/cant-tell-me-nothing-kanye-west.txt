laaa laa la la wait \'til I get my money right

I had a dream I could buy my way to heaven.
When I woke, I spent that on a necklace.
I told God I\'d be back in a second,
Man, It\'s so hard not to act reckless.
To whom much is given, much is tested.
Get arrested, guess until he get the message.
I feel the pressure, under more scrutiny,
And what I do? Act more stupidly.
Bought more jewelery, more Louis V, my momma couldn\'t get through to me.
The drama, people suing me,
I\'m on T.V. talking like it\'s just you and me.
I\'m just saying how I feel man,
I ain\'t one of the Cosbys, I ain\'t go to hill, man.
I guess the money should\'ve changed him,
I guess I should\'ve forgot where I came from.

(hook)
laaa laa la la wait \'til I get my money right.
laaa laa la la then you can\'t tell me nothing, right.

Excuse me. Is you saying something?
Uh, uh, you can\'t tell me nothing.
Let up the suicide doors.
This is my life homey, you decide yours.
I know that Jesus died for us.
But I couldn\'t tell you who decide wars.

Old folks talking \'bout, \"Back in my day.\"
But homey this is my day.
Class started two hours ago, \"Oh, am I late?\"
Plus I already graduated
And you can live through anything if Magic made it.
They say I talk with so much emphasis,
OOOO They so Sen-Sa-Tive.
Don\'t ever fix your lips like collagen
To Say something Where you gon end up apologizing.
Let me know if it\'s a problem man,
Aight man, holla then.
laaa laa la la wait \'til I get my money right.
laaa laa la la then you can\'t tell me nothing, right.

Excuse me. Is you saying something?
Uh, uh, you can\'t tell me nothing.

Let the champagne splash, let that man get cash,
Let that man get pass.
He don\'t needa stop to get gas,
If he can move through the rumors, he can drive off of fumes, CUZ?
How He move in a room full of nose?

Must be the pharoahs, he in tune with his soul,
So when he buried in a tomb full of gold.
Treasure. What\'s you pleasure?
Life is a, uh, depending how you dress her.
So if the devil wear Prada,
Adam Eve wear Nada,
I\'m in between, but way more fresher.
With way less effort, cause when you try hard,
That\'s when you die hard.
Ya homies looking like \"Why God?\"
When they reminisce over you, my god.
laaa laa la la wait \'til I get my money right.
laaa laa la la then you can\'t tell me nothing, right.

Excuse me. Is you saying something?
Uh, uh, you can\'t tell me nothing.
