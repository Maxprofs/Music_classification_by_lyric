                        Bài hát: Through The Night - Slushii, Hatsune Miku

[Verse]
Tell me are you on my mind with your heartbeat
Tell me are you on my mind with you around me
Like you used to

[Chorus]
So I cry, and I cry
As I wake for to catch my phone
Like my heart, will we rise
Through the night, through the night?

[Verse]
Tell me are you on my mind with your heartbeat
Tell me are you on my mind with you round me
Like you used to

[Chorus]
So I cry, and I cry
As I wake for to catch my phone
Like my heart, will we rise
Through the night, through the night?
So I cry, and I cry
As I wake for to catch my phone
Like my heart, will we rise
Through the night, through the night?
                        
                    |
