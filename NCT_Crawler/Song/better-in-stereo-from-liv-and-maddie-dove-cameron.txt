                        [Intro]
 Better in stereo, 
 B-b-better in stereo

 [Verse 1]
 I'm up with the the sunshine (let's go! )
 Lace up my high-tops (oh, no! )
 Slam dunk, ready or not
 Now show me what you got

 I'm under the spotlight (holler)
 I dare you, come on and follow
 You dance to your own beat
 I'll sing the melody! 

 [Verse 2]
 When you say yeah! 
 I say no! 
 When you say stop... 
 (All I wanna do is go, go, go! )

 [Chorus]
 You (you) the other half of me (me)
 The half I'll never be-e
 The half that drives me crazy! 

 [Hook]
 You (you) the other half of me (me)
 The half I'll never be-e
 The half that drives me crazy! 
 You (you) the better half of me (me)
 The half I'll always need! 

 [Outro]
 'Cause we both know
 We're better in stereo!
                        
                    |
