                        Bài hát: Wildcard (Original Mix) - KSHMR, Sidnie Tipton

[Verse 1]
I come around the turn and people stop and stare
I'll make a killin' from this change
Snake eyes and Sevens, you can feel it in the air
You see your fortune and your fame

[Pre-Chorus]
Wanna take a spin? Wanna take a roll?
You know you're dealin' with a wildcard
If you go all in, I'll make your troubles fold
Might take your Diamonds but I'll steal your Heart

[Chorus]
I'm sure you've had a lot of heartaches
But now you've stumbled on a winning hand, a hard Eight
You crossed your fingers and wished upon a shooting star
But now you're dealin' with a wildcard

[Verse 2]
You like my high heels and my lipstick cherry red
You're addicted to the rush
Stop looking for your Queen and sip on Jack instead
I'm here to run the tables, oh, how dare you call my bluff
See, I'm irresistible, kind of unpredictable
Bet you want some action, baby, don't you? Don't you?

[Pre-Chorus]
Wanna take a spin? Wanna take a roll?
You know you're dealin' with a wildcard
If you go all in, I'll make your troubles fold
Might take your Diamonds but I'll steal your Heart

[Chorus]
I'm sure you've had a lot of heartaches
But now you've stumbled on a winning hand, a hard Eight
You crossed your fingers and wished upon a shooting star
But now you're dealin' with a wildcard
                        
                    |
