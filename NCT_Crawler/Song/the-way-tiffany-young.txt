                        Bài hát: The Way - Tiffany (SNSD)

I love the way you make me feel
I love it, I love it
I love the way you make me feel
I love it, I love it

You give me that kind of somethin’
Want it all the time, need it everyday
On a scale of one to ten I’m at a hundred
Never get enough, I can’t stay away

If you want, I got it, I got it everyday
You can get what a player needs from me
Stay boy stay, don’t ever leave me
And I ain’t going nowhere ‘cause you’re a keeper

Don’t you worry, baby you got me
I got a bad boy, I must admit it
You got my heart, don’t know how you did it
And I don’t care this is it babe
I don’t want to hide the way I feel when you’re next to me

I love the way, I love the way
Baby I love the way, ooh I love the way
The way I love you
