                        Bài hát: Let The Bass Go - Snoop Dogg

People to people, party to place
Having the time of your life is all on your face
Hands in the sky, while snatching and catching in the vibe
We go uptown, downtown, that's how we ride!

Dip ya'll strip mall, it's where we be at
It's the top dogg, get the top off while driving the track
Bass, boom, let it go!
Bass, boom, let it go!
Bass, bass, boom, let it go
Bass, bass, boom, let it go
Bass, bass, boom, let it go
Bass, bass, boom, let it go

Now I've seen players, too many to name
Some gain recognition and even fame
Some go slow and so may go fast
But me and my partners we dip and we dash
And we flipping the cash, drip zipping the bag
Should be slick when it crash, all good never bad
All you never had, dreams do come true
For me and you, so let it do what it do!

Boy, let me say, this the ride of your life
And if you're rolling with me, I tell you, I do you right
So put your seat belt on, and let your hair hang low
And if you whip then I suggest you let it go!

People to people, party to place
Having the time of your life is all on your face
Hands in the sky, while snatch and catch in the vibe
We go uptown, downtown, that's how we ride!

Dip ya'll strip mall, it's where we be at
It's the top dogg, get the top off while driving the track
Bass, boom, let it go!
Bass, boom, let it go!
Bass, bass, boom, let it go
Bass, bass, boom, let it go
Bass, bass, boom, let it go
Bass, bass, boom, let it go

Ride, ride, rolling, tipping, advancing
Turning, burning, taking a chance in
We win bouncing ball, just tell me how you play
I never give up, I do this thing like everyday
And I break it down in every day
Oh man, I got carried away
But anyway I'mma say
I feel good everyday!
Every way, la, da, da
I make the beat go da ba da
Pop the heat, stop the beat

Listen, attention, permission
Cause this is the thing, thing, bang, bang
Same range, change lanes
Playing games, get you, get you flick it up!
Rip it up, slip nip and tuck can't get with us
No matter what!
Next better up
It's that enough?
That's what they ask
I'm out the grass, so do it fast!

People to people, party to place
Having the time of your life is all on your face
Hands in the sky, while snatch and catch in the vibe
We go uptown, downtown, that's how we ride!

Dip ya'll strip mall, it's where we be at
It's the top dogg, get the top off while driving the track
Bass, boom, let it go!
Bass, boom, let it go!
Bass, bass, boom, let it go
Bass, bass, boom, let it go
Bass, bass, boom, let it go
Bass, bass, boom, let it go
