                        Bài hát: Sledgehammer - Fifth Harmony

If you could take my pulse right now
It would feel just like a sledgehammer
If you could feel my heartbeat now
It would hit you like a sledgehammer

I don't admit it
I play it cool
But every minute
That I'm with you

I feel the fever and I won't lie
I break a sweat
My body's telling all the secrets
I ain't told you yet

Oh, oh
I struggle to contain
Woah, oh
The love that's in my veins
Oh, oh
And how it circulates
Oh, oh

If you could take my pulse right now
It would feel just like a sledgehammer
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,oh)
If you could feel my heartbeat now
It would hit you like a sledgehammer
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,oh)

You're taken over the beat of my body
You just don't let up, don't let up
You're taken over the beat of my body
But you lift me up, lift me up
If you could take my pulse right now
It would feel just like a sledgehammer
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,oh)

So close together
So far apart
You're turning me on
And my body's waiting for your spark

Oh, oh
I struggle to contain
Woah, oh
The love that's in my veins
Oh, oh
And how it circulates
Oh, oh

If you could take my pulse right now
It would feel just like a sledgehammer
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,oh)
If you could feel my heartbeat now
It would hit you like a sledgehammer
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,oh)

You're taken over the beat of my body
You just don't let up, don't let up
You're taken over the beat of my body
But you lift me up, lift me up
If you could take my pulse right now
It would feel just like a sledgehammer
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,oh)

The truth is out
No stopping now
I'm getting closer
I've had enough
Undressed my love
I'm coming after you

If you could take my pulse right now
It would feel just like a sledgehammer, oh
Let me take my pulse right now
It would feel just like a sledgehammer, hammer, oh
If you take my pulse

If you could take my pulse right now
It would feel just like a sledgehammer
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,oh)
If you could feel my heartbeat now
It would hit you like a sledgehammer
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,oh)

You're taken over the beat of my body
You just don't let up, don't let up
You're taken over the beat of my body
But you lift me up, lift me up
If you could take my pulse right now
It would feel just like a sledgehammer
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,oh)
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,oh)
