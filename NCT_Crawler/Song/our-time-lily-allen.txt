                        Bài hát: Our Time - Lily Allen

It’s 2 am so I just stopped the music
I’m still swaying like always on a cruise ship
Til the world straight out on my mouth
Come on everybody back to my house
Take my hand now, you’re coming over
It doesn’t matter you can sleep on my sofa
Bring some fracs and brings some wristlets
We’re gonna party like it’s nobody’s business

Let your hair down now
It’s the end of the weekend
This is all dead now
Let’s go get a bit thin
And put your red rags on
Cause they’re not like we’re queens of the night

And we can swing and dance the night away
We don’t give a damn what people say
We’ve had enough so turn it up
Tonight we’re taking over
And we will wear our drink til we lose our minds
Wanna lose sense of space and time
We’re going through, It’s how we do
Tonight we’re taking over


I feel fly
I’m looking kenzo
I’ll get high but I ain’t doing pences
I might dance like you’re auntie
I don’t care cause we’re here to party
I got a quite good record collection
Yeah I got everything that came out on Def jam
I’ve got hip hop, I’ve got dubstep
I’ll take us right through from sunrise to sunset

Let your hair down now
It’s the end of the weekend
This is all dead now
Let’s go get a bit thin
And put your red rags on
Cause they’re not like we’re queens of the night

And we can swing and dance the night away
We don’t give a damn what people say
We’ve had enough so turn it up
Tonight we’re taking over
And we will wear our drink til we lose our minds
Wanna lose sense of space and time
We’re going through, it’s how we do
Tonight we’re taking over
I can’t call in the morning
Dance a little harder
Shout a little louder if you like
Maybe a little faster
Get a little sooner
Do it if it makes you feel alright

I can’t call in the morning
Dance a little harder
Shout a little louder if you like
Maybe a little faster
Get a little sooner
Do it if it makes you feel alright

Go hard
Go harder now
Go hard
Go harder now

And we can swing and dance the night away
We don’t give a damn what people say
We’ve had enough so turn it up
Tonight we’re taking over
And we will wear our drink til we lose our minds
Wanna lose sense of space and time
We’re going through, it’s how we do
Tonight we’re taking over
