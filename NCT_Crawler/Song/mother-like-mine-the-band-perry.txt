Country|

                        She's the sky that holds the clouds
 She's the lady of the house
 A blind believer in all I dare to be
 There's no safer place I've found
 Than the shoulder of her white night gown
 Oh I've got the best and the worst of her in me
 And I'd share her if I could So the wars would all be over
 'Cause she'd raise us all as friends
 And no one would ever wonder if somebody wanted them
 We'd walk on grass that's greener
 And our cares would all be freer
 If the world had a mother like mine She's our father's one great love
 She's the one he wanted most
 She's the light in the window of the house I grew up in
 She takes the midnight call
 She's the bravest of us all
 Still she sings in the garden, she let's her hair down in Oh the wars would all be over
 'Cause she'd raise us all as friends
 And no one would ever wonder, if somebody wanted them
 Tonight would be easier
 And our dreams would all be deeper
 If the world had a mother like mine Don't go away, don't go away from me
 Oh I understand, she is a helping hand still
 I have to say She's the sky that holds the clouds
 She's the lady of our house
 We all need her, but no one more than me Oh the wars would all be over
 'Cause she'd raise us all as friends
 And no one would ever wonder, if somebody wanted them
 We'd walk on grass that's greener
 And the dishes would all be cleaner
 If the world had a mother like mine Oh like mine
