                        Bài hát: Make U A Believer - Usher

If Young Metro don't trust you I'm gon' shoot ya

You keep listenin' to what all your friends say
Don't listen to 'em, they tryna take your place
I can make you a believer, I can make you a believer
I can make you a believer, I can make you a believer baby
Baby when I'm with you I don't take any phone calls
When I'm with you I just turn all my phones off
I can make you a believer, I can make you a believer
I can make you a believer, I can make you a believer baby

Tongue game if you believe in that ***
Stick game if you believe in that ***
Shoe game, wrist game
Tell me baby what you want of that ***
Net worth bout the same as Netflix
Chill with a nigga and I'll show you that ***
I swear that my *** could turn into your ***
We can call it our ***
Yeah, yeah, yeah that's why them bitches hatin' over there
Take you shoppin' like anywhere
P or Sydney, I take you there
And I get you with him, serenade them cookies
What ever you want, I swear you can get it with me

But you keep listenin' to what all your friends say
Don't listen to 'em, they tryna take your place
I can make you a believer, I can make you a believer
I can make you a believer, I can make you a believer baby
Baby when I'm with you I don't take any phone calls
When I'm with you I just turn all my phones off
I can make you a believer, I can make you a believer
I can make you a believer, I can make you a believer baby

100 can't believe in that ***
No games, I believe in that ***
Girl if I think it, I said it, I mean it
Believe in that ***
I'm too rich to fall for that ***
She ain't *** for me to cheat with
You like bitches, I like bitches
We can get bitches to keep it secret
We got that ghetto love
Nothing can break it up
I roll a blunt
You pop brownie, yo baby we touch on drugs
Baby you got me so crazy
Love me forever, you're obviously my baby

But you keep listenin' to what all your friends say
Don't listen to 'em, they tryna take your place
I can make you a believer, I can make you a believer
I can make you a believer, I can make you a believer baby
Baby when I'm with you I don't take any phone calls
When I'm with you I just turn all my phones off
I can make you a believer, I can make you a believer
I can make you a believer, I can make you a believer baby

Show you better than I can tell you, I bet ya
Moment I met ya
Knew that I was gonna get ya
Too much sauce drippin' on me, don't be actin' like you actin'
Don't be actin' like you don't see the *** that I've been doin'
Who you think you foolin'? Nobody but yourself
Damn girl, you fine girl, be careful
Girl don't you be overthink
Me plus you that equals win
Tellin' you should be all in
All in babe

But you keep listenin' to what all your friends say
Don't listen to 'em, they tryna take your place
I can make you a believer, I can make you a believer
I can make you a believer, I can make you a believer baby
Baby when I'm with you I don't take any phone calls
When I'm with you I just turn all my phones off
I can make you a believer, I can make you a believer
I can make you a believer, I can make you a believer baby

This your ***, believe
