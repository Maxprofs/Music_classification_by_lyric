                        Bài hát: Stay With Me - La'Porsha Renae

Where did you go when things went wrong?
Who did you run to and find a shoulder to lay your head upon?
Wasn't I there?
Didn't I take good care of you?
No no, I can't believe you're leaving me
Stay with me
Stay with me
Won't you, stay with me
I can't go on
Who did you touch when you needed tenderness?
I gave you so much
And in return, I found happiness
Mm, what did I do?
Maybe I, maybe I was too good to you
Oh no, I can't believe you're leaving me
Stay with me
Stay with me
Please stay with me
Remember you said you was gon' need me?
Remember you said you'd never ever leave me?
Remember, remember
I'm asking you, I'm begging you
Stay with me
Please, please stay with me
Stay with me
I can't go on
Ooh, stay with me
I'm begging you to stay with, stay with me
Stay with me
I can't go on
