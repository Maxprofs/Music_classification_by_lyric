                        Give me more loving than I've ever had. 
Make it all better when I'm feeling sad, tell me that I'm special even when I know I'm not. 
Make me feel good when I hurt so bad, barely getting mad, I'm glad I found YOU, I love being around YOU. 

Chorus: 
YOU make it easy, as easy as 1, 2. 1, 2, 3, 4
There's only one thing, two do, three word, four YOU. 
I love YOU. 
There's only one way, two say, those three words and that's what i'll do. 
I love YOU.

Gave me more love from the very start. 
Piece me back together when I fall apart. 
Tell me things that YOU don't even tell your closest friends. 
Make me feel good when I hurt so bad.
Best that I've had. 
I'm so glad I found YOU, I love being around YOU. 

Chorus: (repeat 2 times)

one.....two.....three.....four.....I love YOU.....I love YOU.
