 While I'm hangin' out the window of your Daddy's Lambo'
 Scrambled eggs, I got scrambled ammo
 Leave you on top of the water like a banana boat Yeah, I'm an animal, everybody's edible
 The Yelawolf is headed for your arm and hand
 And yo' head, I'm a cannibal
 But if it's a man's hoppin' with the fans like a *** antelope So send him to me in a minute
 When you're finished and I'll put him in a vice grip
 Put an end to the image
 And I'll send it in the, via independent fucker with the mic grill I'm highest pimpin', pull the trigger back
 In a submarine with sub machine loaded
 In an ocean, high deep
 Keep him on the submarine imploded Cry my name, motherfucker vmanos
 It's me and I'm sick in the prognosis
 Got more bars than 45
 And I put you behind them and I'm like, adios bitch I can make your mama really proud to know me
 And your buck daddy is kinda lonely
 Give me fifty bucks in penny rolls
