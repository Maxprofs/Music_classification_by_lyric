                        Something, something's taking over me
 Shaking, bottled up inside of me
 Crawling, crawling in the shadows so no one finds me
 Hiding, paranoid I suffer no sleeping
 I'm annoyed, I think you should shut it
 Give me no attention or you'll be sorry I've got nothing left to lose
 You always get your way
 Got everything to prove
 I saw you turn away Got nothing left to lose
 You always get your way
 Got everything to prove
 You always get your way Help me, sitting front of fire, I'm melting
 Don't you leave me hanging, I'm burning
 Can't hold on forever, I'm not that stupid
 Genius, cracking underneath this pressure
 Sorry, couldn't keep it together
 I know I've got it coming but you'll be sorry I've got nothing left to lose
 You always get your way
 Got everything to prove
 I saw you turn away Got nothing left to lose
 You always get your way
 Got everything to prove
 You always get your way
 You always get your way
 I won't just turn away I won't just turn away Save me from myself
 Always get your way
 Save me from myself Oh, I've got nothing left to lose
 You always get your way
 Got everything to prove
 I saw you turn away Got nothing left to lose
 You always get your way
 Got everything to prove
 You always get your way
 You always get your way
 I won't just turn away You always get your way
 I saw you turn away
