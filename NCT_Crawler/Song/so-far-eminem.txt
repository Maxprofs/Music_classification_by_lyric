R&B/Hip Hop/Rap|

                        I own a mansion, but live in a house
 A king-size bed, but I sleep on the couch
 I'm Mr.Brightside, glass is half full
 But my tank is half empty, gasket just blew This always happens, thirty minutes from home
 Gotta lay a log cabin and only option I have is McDonald's bathroom
 In a public stall dropping a football
 So every time someone walks in the john I get Madden
 ''Shady, what up?''- What? Come on, man, I'm ***ping
 And you're asking me for my got damn autograph on a napkin?
 Oh, that's odd, I just happened to run out of tissue
 Yeah, hand me that, on second thought I'd be glad then
 ''Thanks, dawg, name's Todd, a big fan''
 I wiped my ass with it, crumbled it up in a wad and threw it back and
 Told him ''Todd, you're the ***'' when does all of this *** end?
 Can't park my ass without causing an accident
 Puff my gas, cut my grass, can't take out the *** trash
 Without someone passing through my sub harassing
 I'd count my blessings, but I suck at math
 I'd rather wallow then bass suffering from succotash
 But the antacid is my stomach gas
 I mix my corn with my *** mash
 Potato, so what, ho, kiss my country bumpkin ass
 Missouri Southern roots, what the *** is upperclass
 Call lunch dinner, call dinner supper
 Tupperware in a covered plastic wear up the ass
 Stuck in the past, iPod, what the *** is that?
 B-boy to the core, mule, I'm a stubborn ass Maybe that's why I feel so strange
 Got it all, but I still won't change
 Maybe that's why I can't leave Detroit
 It's the motivation that keeps me going
 This is the inspiration I need
 I can never turn my back on a city that made me
 (Life's been good to me so far) They call me classless, I heard that, I second and third that
 Don't know what the *** I would doing if it weren't rap
 Probably be a giant turd-sack
 But I blew, never turned back
 Turned forty and still sag
 Teenagers act more *** mature, Jack
 *** you gonna say to me?
 I leave on my own terms, ***, I'm going berzerk
 My nerves are bad, but I love the perks my work has
 I get to meet famous people, look at her, dag
 Her nylons ran, her skirt snag
 And I heard she drag-races, *burp* swag
 ***ing my Hanes shirt tag
 You're Danica Patrick (yeah) work, skag
 We'd be the perfect match
 'Cause you're a vacuum, I'm a dirtbag
 My apologies, no disrespect to technology
 But what the heck is all of these buttons?
 You expect me to sit here and learn that?
 *** I gotta do to hear this new song from Luda?
 Be an expert at computers?
 I'd rather be an encyclopedia Britannica, hell with a Playstation
 I'm still on my first manual from Zelda
 Nintendo, bitch, run, jump, punch, stab and I melt the
 Mozzarella on my spaghetti, put in on bread
 Make a sandwich with welch's and belch
 They say this spray butter is bad for my health, but
 I think there's more white trash from the trailer
 Jed Clampett, Redd Sanford welfare mentality helps to
 Keep me grounded, that's why I never take full advantage of wealth, I
 Managed to dwell within these parameters
 Still cramming the shelves full of hamburger helper
 I can't even help it, this is the hand I was dealt to
 Creature of habit, feel like I'm trapped in an animal shelter
 With all these pet peeves
 God dammit to hell, I can't stand all these kids with their camera cellphones
 I can't go anywhere, I get so mad I can yell, the
 Other day someone got little elaborate and stuck a *** dead cat in my mailbox
 Went to Burger King, they spit on my onion rings
 I think my karma is catching up with me Maybe that's why I feel so strange
 Got it all, but I still won't change
 Maybe that's why I can't leave Detroit
 It's the motivation that keeps me going
 This is the inspiration I need
 I can never turn my back on a city that made me
 (Life's been good to me so far) Got friends on Facebook, all over the world
 Not sure what that means, they tell me it's good
 So I'm artist of the decade, I even got a plaque
 I'd hang it up, but the frame is all cracked I'm trying to be lowkey, hopefully nobody notices me
 In produce hunched over, giant nosebleed
 Over stop as I mosey over to the frozen aisle
 By the frozen yogurt this guy approached me
 Embarrassed, I just did Comerica with Hova
 Show's over, I'm hiding in Kroeger buying groceries
 He just had front row seats, told me to sign this poster
 Then insults me "wow, up close didn't know you had crow's feet"
 I'm at a crossroad lost till shopping at Costco
 Sloppy Joe's, buck waffles
 Got caught picking my nose, ah
 Look over see these two hot hoes
 Finger still up in one of my nostrils
 Right next to 'em stuck at the light
 This *** *** is taking forever to change
 I'm stuck, these bitches are loving it rubbing it in
 Chuckling, couldn't do nothing, play it off
 ''What you bumping? Trunk Muzik? Yelawolf's better'', *** bitch
 They want me to flip at the label, but I won't succumb to it
 The pressure, they want me to follow up with another one after Recovery
 Was so highly coveted, but what good is a *** recovery if I fumble it?
 'Cause I'mma drop the ball if I don't get a grip
 Hopping on shrubbery on you sons of bitches
 Wrong subdivison to *** with, bitch
 Quit snapping *** pictures of my kids
 I love my city, but you push me to my limit, what a pity
 The *** I complain about
 It's like there ain't a cloud in the sky and it's raining out
 Kool Aid stain on the couch, I'd never get it out
 Bitch, I got an elevator in my house
 Ants and a mouse, I'm living the dream Maybe that's why I feel so strange
 Got it all, but I still won't change
 Maybe that's why I can't leave Detroit
 It's the motivation that keeps me going
 This is the inspiration I need
 I can never turn my back on a city that made me
 (Life's been good to me so far)
