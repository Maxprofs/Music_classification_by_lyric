                        Hear the wind sing a sad old song
 It knows I'm leaving you today
 Please don't cry or my heart will break
 When I go on my way Goodbye my love, goodbye
 Goodbye and au revoir
 As long as you remember me
 I'll never be too far Goodbye my love, goodbye
 I always will be true
 So hold me in your dreams
 Till I come back to you See the stars in the skies above
 They'll shine wherever I may roam
 I will pray every lonely night
 That soon they'll guide me home Goodbye my love, goodbye
 Goodbye and au revoir
 As long as you remember me
 I'll never be too far Goodbye my love, goodbye
 I always will be true
 So hold me in your dreams
 Till I come back to you
                        
                    |
