                        Bài hát: How That Taste - Kehlani

They didn't want me then, they want me now
Did not want me to win, but now they're proud
Now they're payin' to get in, they in the crowd
Tell me how's it feel now? Tell me, how's it feel now?
Bein' low, yeah you a snake
You puttin' on a show, that Ricki Lake
Hey man I don't trip, my life's great
But swallow that pride, tell me how *** taste

Tell me how *** taste
Tell me how that *** taste
Tell me how that *** taste
Bitch tell me how that

Always crowdin' it cause they solvin' me
In the mall goin' up cause they go hard for me
Yeah the only way's up, y'all gon' ball with me
Man the whole damn fam gon' touch the sky with me
Touch the sky with me, touch the sky with me
Man the whole damn fam gon' touch the sky with me
Touch the sky with me, touch the sky with me
Man the whole damn fam gon' touch the sky with me

They askin' for the verse, a hundred racks
If you ain't talkin' money, then run it back
My pockets too deep for 'em not to be stacked
Yeah you lookin' like distraction, now fall back
Bitch your music's been weak, your fashion wack
Was talkin' out your neck, not even facts
I'm way too real to stoop low
I'm too busy on the road, I'm too busy bookin' shows

Tell me how *** taste
Tell me how that *** taste
Tell me how that *** taste
Bitch tell me how that

Always crowdin' it cause they solvin' me
In the mall goin' up cause they go hard for me
Yeah the only way's up, y'all gon' ball with me
Man the whole damn fam gon' touch the sky with me
Touch the sky with me, touch the sky with me
Man the whole damn fam gon' touch the sky with me
Touch the sky with me, touch the sky with me
Man the whole damn fam gon' touch the sky with me
