                        Bài hát : I Wanna Go - Yuna

He's one in a million
I don't know when I'll be seeing him again
He wants to live in a city
Moved out there and he was just seventeen, just seventeen

No I'm not prepared, no I'm not prepared
My heart's beating really fast, really fast
But I wanna go there, but I wanna go there
Let's walk a little further, you know I wanna be here

I wanna go wherever, whenever you wanna go wherever you wanna
I wanna go with you
I wanna go wherever, whenever you wanna go wherever you wanna
Can I go with you?

He stares so politely
I'm best behaving when he's walking with me, walking with me
Oh, he likes taking photos in black and white
They're upon his walls, on his walls

No I'm not prepared, no I'm not prepared
My heart's beating really fast, really fast
But I wanna go there, but I wanna go there
Let's walk a little further, you know I wanna be here

I wanna go wherever, whenever you wanna go wherever you wanna
I wanna go with you
I wanna go wherever, whenever you wanna go wherever you wanna
Can I go with you?

I wanna go wherever, whenever you wanna go wherever you wanna
I wanna go with you
I wanna go wherever, whenever you wanna go wherever you wanna
Can I go with you?
