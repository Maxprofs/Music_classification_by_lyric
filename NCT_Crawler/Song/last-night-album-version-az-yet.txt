                        Last night, you were so into it
 You told me secrets that, you never told a soul
 You were so nervous and, yet oh so comfortable
 As we explored your image of love

 I drank your wine as you tasted mine
 I kissed your lips you felt my mind slip
 Into your soul
 I almost cried 'cause it was so beautiful

 1-Last night I was inside of you
 Last night while making love to you
 I saw the sun, the moon, the mountains and the rivers
 I saw heaven when I made sweet love to you

 Last night there was no blood in it
 It was so special and, so very innocent
 We talked of memories, our favorite fantasies
 As we explored, our visions of love

 Deep in the night, right by the fireside
 You felt my candlelight in your soul
 You felt incredible, I started to explode
 I almost cried 'cause it was so beautiful
 (repeat 1)

 Sunlight, (sunlight) red roses (red roses)
 The scent of you it calms the heart
 The sight of you I fall apart
 Moonlight, the things we noticed
 Oh we're in love, that's when it comes
 And I'm so, I'm so in love
 (rpt 1...)
