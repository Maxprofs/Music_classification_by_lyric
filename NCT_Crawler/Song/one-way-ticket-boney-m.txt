                        ONE WAY TICKET 
Ye tee ye tee ...... Oh !
One way ticket, one-way ticket, 
One way ticket, one-way ticket to the blues.

Choo choo train a chuggin' down the track gotta travel home never comin' back woo .... Gotta one-way ticket to the blues.

Bye bye love my baby's leavin' me, now lonely teardrop are all that I can see, woo, gotta one way ticket to the blues

I'm gonna take a trip to the lonesome town, gonna stay at heart break hotel. A fool such as I there never was I cry the tear so well ....
One way ticket, one-way ticket, one-way ticket to the blues...
