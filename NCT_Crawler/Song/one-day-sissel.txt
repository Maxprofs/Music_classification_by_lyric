                        One Day
 (Sissel/Mikkel S.E./Hallgeir Rustan/Tor Erik Hermansen)

 Here I am, on my own again
 All alone but not afraid
 Here I stand, nowhere near the end
 Time to go a different way

 Cause another day will come to those who dare
 Believe in something new

 When you follow your shining star
 Leave all your fears behind
 You will find love no matter where you are
 And all your heart will say - one day

 When you're down, and you haven't found
 Where you think you want to go
 Do you search for higher ground
 Deep inside you really know

 Cause another day will come to those who dare
 Believe in something new

 When you follow your shining star
 Leave all your fears behind
 You will find love no matter where you are
 And all your heart will say - one day

 I know it's hard to leave
 The future seems so far away and,
 Believe that all you need will come to you - one day

 Follow your shining star
 Leave all your fears behind
 You will find love no matter where you are
 And all your heart will say
 You will find love no matter where you are
 And all your heart will say - one day
                        
                    |
