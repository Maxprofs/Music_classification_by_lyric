                        Bài hát: Dance For Me - Lynda Trang Đài ,Tommy Ngô

Emmanuel he knows the girls he knows her all all too well
She's got him in a tango and she's got him in her spell
She dances with his mind as she dances on on the floor
And she knows how to drive him lo-co!!

Dance for me now my love
My love my love my love
Dance for me now my love
My love my love.

Bonita knows he's trouble but wat else she do
He's got her round his finger with his twisted points of view
He dances away her troubles 
He's dancing through her life
He's got her working hard for him all night.

(Dance for me, dance for me.)
Emmanuel's seen it all but none like this before
A girl who turns up the heat by walking through the door
And when she hits the dance floor, she burns out al the lights
She's the one and only one thing in his sights.

Bonita doesn't know just where it's all gonna lead
She only knows what she wants and what she really needs
He needs to know what makes her tick and all the other games
He knows no other woman will the be the same.
