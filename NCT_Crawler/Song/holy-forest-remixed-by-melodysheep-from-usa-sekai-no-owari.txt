                        Bài hát: Holy Forest (Remixed By Melodysheep From U.S.A) - Sekai No Owari

Inside the bird cage freedom is sung,
So loud that our freedom song can’t be heard.
All the lives lost 
Make no difference to us... to us.

The prayers of beasts locked inside the camp
Are softly surrounded by the poison gas.
It’s just like what the world feared of all those years ago.
The stories from 1940 to 1945.

I lost.

End of the world (2)
Make no difference to us... 
Make no difference to us.

Inside the bug cage the butterfly prays of freedom
And our freedom prayers can’t be heard.
All the lives lost 
Make no difference to us.... 

In a pet shop where life has a price tag,
We pick up and hold the lonely cat to our chests.
It’s like buying and selling a life for profit
Oh, what’s it called again?
I’m too tired to remember the word.

End of the world (2)
Make no difenrence to us....

Everybody has a different view of this world.
I just want to live in harmony.
There is no life that comes with a price into this world
I just want to treasure everything.

End of the world (4)

One day I began to feel that dogs weren’t locked up in chains
So please let me ask you this:
“What is the reason that you are free?"
                        
                    |
