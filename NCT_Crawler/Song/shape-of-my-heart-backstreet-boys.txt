                        Baby, please try to forgive me
Stay here don't put out the glow
Hold me now
Don't bother 
If every minute it makes me weaker
You can save me from the man that I've become, 
oh yeah!

CHORUS:
Looki n' back on the things I've done(girl and my girl)
I was tryin' to be someone(tryin’ to be someone)
I played my part,
kept old in the dark
Now let me show you the shape of my heart



Sadness is beautiful
lonelyness thats tragical
So help me I can't win this war, oh no
Touch me now
don't bother
if every second it makes me weaker
You can save me from the man I've become (ohhh)

CHORUS:
Look in' back on the things I've done(
I was tryin' to be someone(tryin’ to be some one)
I played my part,
kept old in the dark
Now let me show you (now let me showw you the)
the shape of my heart(show you the shape of my heart)


BRIDGE
I'm here 
with my confession
Got nothing to hide no more
I don't know where to start
But to show you the shape of my heart
I'm lookin' back on the things I've done

I never wanna played the same old part 
or kept you in the dark
Now let me show you the shape of my heart
                        
                    |
