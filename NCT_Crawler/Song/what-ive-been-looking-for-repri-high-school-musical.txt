Âu Mỹ khác|

                        t's hard to believe
That I couldn't see

Together:
You were always there beside me
Thought I was alone
With no one to hold
But you were always right beside me


This feelings like no other

Together:
I want you to know

I've never had someone that knows me like you do
the way you do
I've never had somone as good for me as you
no one like you so lonely before i finally found
what i've been looking for
                        
                    |
