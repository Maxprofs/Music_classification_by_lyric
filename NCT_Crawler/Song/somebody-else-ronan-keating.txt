Somebody Else
Bleu
By Pevy Jane

What if I was alright
What if I wasn′t wound so tight
What if I had the balls to be bad
Would you still look at me like that
Would you be mad that I had held the old me back

Why can′t I be somebody else
Somebody who
isn′t too cool to believe it′s Ok to be just me

Maybe I was too much
Maybe I′ll take it down at notch
Maybe I have the guts to go mad
Maybe I mess me up real bad
Maybe I′ll make you wish you had the old me back

Why can′t I be somebody else
Somebody who
isn′t too cool to believe it′s Ok to be just me

What if I can′t remember who I′m tryin′ to be
Why can′t I be somebody else
Somebody who
isn′t too cool to believe it′s Ok to be just me
Just me!
