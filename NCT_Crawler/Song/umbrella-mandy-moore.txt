                        Bài hát : Umbrella - Mandy Moore

You had my heart
We'll never be worlds Apart
They be in magazines
You'll still be my star
Baby cause in the dark
you can't see shiny cars
That's when you need me there
With you i'll always Share
Because

[CHORUS]
When the sun Shine
We shine Together
Told you i'll be here Forever
Said I'll always be your friend
So come on out and stick it till the end
Now that it's raining more then ever
Know that we'll still have eachother
You can stand under my Umbrella
You can stand under my Umbrella
(Ella ella eh eh eh)
Under my umbrella
(ella ella eh eh eh)
Under my umbrella
(ella ella eh eh eh)
Under my umbrella
(ella ella eh eh eh)

Cause everything
Will never come in between
Your apart of my Entity
Here for infinity
When the war has delt it's part
when the world has delt it's card
If the hand is hard
Together we'll messure up
Because

[BRIDGE]
You can run into my arms
it's okay don't be alarmed
(Come into me)
(there's no distance in between our love)
Go on and let the Rain pour
I'll be out here needing more
Because

It's raining
Oh baby it's raining
Baby Come Into me
Come into me
It's raining
Oh baby it's raining
You can always come into me
                        
                    |
