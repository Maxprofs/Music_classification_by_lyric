                        Song: I Like It - Enrique Iglesias, Pitbull

One love.. One love
Enrique iglesias, pitbull
Ya'll know what time it is
We go set it off tonight, just go
Set the club on fire, just go
Enrique! Holla at them like.

Girl please excuse me
If i'm coming too strong
But tonight is the night
We can really let go
My girlfriend is out of town
And i'm all alone
Your boyfriend is on vacation
And he doesn't have to know
No oh oh, oh oh
No one can do the things i'm gonna wanna do to you
No oh oh, oh oh
Shout aloud, screamin loud
Let me hear you go

Baby i like it
The way you move on the floor
Baby i like it
Come on and give me some more
Oh yes i like it
Screaming like never before
Baby i like it
I, i, i like it.

Party, karamu, fiesta, forever

Girl please excuse me
If i'm misbehaving, oh
I'm trying keep my hands off
But you're begging me for more
Round round round
Give a low low low
Let the time time pass
â€˜cause we're never getting old
No oh oh, oh oh
No one can do it better turn around i'll give you more
No oh oh, oh oh
Shout aloud, screamin loud
Let me hear you go

Baby i like it
The way you move on the floor
Baby i like it
Come on and give me some more
Oh yes i like it
Screaming like never before
Baby i like it
I, i, i like it.

Come dj that's my dj
I'm a miami boy. You know how we play
I'm playing what u wanna i play
What u give me got me good
Now watch me.

It's a different species, get me in dc
Let's party on the white house lawn
Tiger woods tired of jesse james
Here goes pitbull all night long
Pick up barack and michelle and let'em that it's on.

Pa' fuera Pa' la calle
Dale mamita tirame ese baile
Dale mamita tirame ese baile

I see you watchin me, you see me watchin' you
I love the way you move
I like them things you do like.

Don't stop baby, don't stop baby
Just keep on shaking along
I won't stop baby, won't stop baby
Until you get enough.

Party, karamu, fiesta, forever

Baby i like it
The way you move on the floor
Baby i like it
Come on and give me some more
Oh yes i like it
Screaming like never before
Baby i like it! I, i, i like it

Baby i like it
The way you move on the floor
Baby i like it
Come on and give me some more
Oh yes i like it
Screaming like never before
Baby i like it! I, i, i like it

Party, (oh yes i like it) karamu, fiesta, forever
Oh yes i like it
Party, karamu, (oh yes i like it) fiesta, forever
