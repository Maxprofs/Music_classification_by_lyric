                        A soft sound
 To the way she wears her hair down
 Covering up her face
 Oh what a let down
 I don't seem to be having any effect now
 Falling all over the place But you're losing your words
 We're speaking in bodies
 Avoiding me and talking 'bout you
 But you're losing your turn
 I guess I'll never learn
 Cause I stay another hour or two For crying out loud, settle down!
 You know I can't be found with you
 We get back to my house
 Your arms, my mouth
 Now I just stop myself around you A small town
 Dictating all the people we get around
 What a familiar face
 Do you get what I mean now?
 I'm so fixated on the girl with the soft sound
 And hair all over the place But you're sure that I'd learn
 I'm pushing through bodies
 Avoiding me and walking around you
 But you're cold and I burn
 I guess I'll never learn
 Cause I stay another hour or two For crying out loud, settle down!
 You know I can't be found with you
 We get back to my house
 Your arms, my mouth
 Now I just stop myself around you A soft sound
 To the way she wears her hair down
 Covering up her face
 Oh what a let down,
 I don't seem to be having any effect now
 Falling all over the place But you're losing your words
 We're speaking in bodies
 Avoiding me and talking 'bout you
 But you're losing your turn
 I guess I'll never learn
 Cause I stay another hour or two For crying out loud, settle down!
 You know I can't be found with you
 We get back to my house
 Your arms, my mouth
 Now I just stop myself around you For crying out loud
