Không Lời|

                        There's a place where lovers go
 To cry their troubles away
 And they call it lonesome town
 Where the broken hearts stay

 You can buy a dream or two
 To last you all through the years
 And the only price you pay
 Is a heart full of tears

 Goin' down to lonesome town
 Where the broken hearts stay
 Goin' down to lonesome town
 To cry my troubles away

 In the town of broken dreams
 The streets are filled with regret
 Maybe down in lonesome town
 I can learn to forget
 Maybe down in lonesome town
 I can learn to forget

 Lonesome town
                        
                    |
