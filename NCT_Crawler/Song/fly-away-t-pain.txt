                        Yeah, I wish I can grow some wings and get up out of this situation
 I do it with no hesitation, yeah, I wish I can know those things
 That everybody else knows, it's my decision, don't need permission to Fly away, way, fly away, way, fly away, way
 I go through this everyday so why fly away, way
 I can fly away, way, fly away, way
 No one listens to what I say so why fly away Somebody told me, told me, today was my day, day
 They see me on the big screen and they see me on the stage
 And it must be true 'cause here I am, here I am baby
 I wanna thank you Let me fly away, way, fly away, way, fly away, way
 And I go through this everyday so why fly away, way
 I can fly away, way, fly away, way And I go through this everyday so why fly away
 And I go through this everyday so why fly away, fly away, fly away
 No one listens to what I say so why fly away, way
 Fly away, way, fly away, way And I go through this everyday so why fly away, way
 Fly away, way, fly away, way
 No one listens to what I say so why fly away, way, way, way
 No one listens to what I say so why fly away, way
 Fly away, way, fly away, way And I go through this everyday so why fly away, way
 Fly away, way, fly away, way
 And I go through this everyday so why fly away, way
 Fly away, way, fly away, way
 No one listens to what I say so why fly away, way, way, way
