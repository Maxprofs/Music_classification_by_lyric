                        Bài hát: I don't care - DJ Melodie

I’m in love,
It’s a beautiful day.
I’m in love,
It’s a beautiful way. 
I don’t care what the weather might say, 
It’s a beautiful day.


I’ve meet you,
I’m never blue.
Close my eyes,
And my whishes come thru.
Need you so,
You’ll never know.
Come with me,
It’s a beautiful day.

I do believe if I try 
I do believe I can fly
Fall thru a hole in the sky
Say you’ll catch me


I’m in love, 
It’s a beautiful day.
I’m in love,
It’s a beautiful way.
I don’t care what the weather might say,
It’s a beautiful day.

I’m in love,
It’s a beautiful day.
I’m so high,
It’s a beautiful day.
I don’t care if it’s cloudy and gray, 
It’s a beautiful day.


I’ve meet you,
I’m never blue.
Close my eyes,
And my whishes come thru.
Need you so,
You’ll never know.
Come with me,
It’s a beautiful day.

I do believe if I try 
I do believe I can fly
Fall thru a hole in the sky
Say you’ll catch me


I’m in love, 
It’s a beautiful day.
I’m in love,
It’s a beautiful way.
I don’t care what the weather might say,
It’s a beautiful day.

I’m in love,
It’s a beautiful day.
I’m so high,
It’s a beautiful day.
I don’t care if it’s cloudy and gray, 
It’s a beautiful day.

Come, come, come into my world 
Won’t you lift me up, up,
High up on you’re love
                        
                    |
