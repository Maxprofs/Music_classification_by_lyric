                        Bài hát: Diddy Bop - Jacob Banks, Louis The Child

[Verse 1: Jacob Banks]
Time's never late it is your currency
Oh, you can spend it how you like
Two empty souls won't fill the vacancy
I know that's heavy on your mind

[Pre-Chorus: Jacob Banks]
Cigarette smoke won't make you feel at home
Yesterdays are made for letting go
Silver will never feel like gold
And chasing shadows will leave you in the cold

[Chorus: Jacob Banks]
Oh, you should dance some more
Don't need nobody to take you home
Grab a drink or four
Don't need nobody to take you home

[Verse 2: Jacob Banks]
Oh, there's a world outside for you to see
It's all beyond the borderline
Two empty souls won't fill the vacancy
You'll never know until you try

[Pre-Chorus 2: Jacob Banks]
Shooting stars were made for you to see
Even clouds could use some company
Swimming in your sky of make believe
It's okay, if you're lonely
*** I get lonely too

[Chorus: Jacob Banks]
Oh, you should dance some more
Don't need nobody to take you home
Grab a drink or four
Don't need nobody to take you home
Now the floor is yours
Don't need nobody to call your phone
You better dance some more
Don't need nobody to take you home

[Outro: Jacob Banks]
You should dance some more
Don't need nobody to take you home
You should dance some more
Don't need nobody to take you home
                        
                    |
