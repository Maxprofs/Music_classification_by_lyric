                        Bài hát : I Started A Joke - V.A

I started a joke, which started the whole world crying,
But I didnt see that the joke was on me, oh no.
I started to cry, which started the whole world laughing,

Oh, if Id only seen that the joke was on me.
I looked at the skies, running my hands over my eyes,

And I fell out of bed, hurting my head from things that Id said.
Til I finally died, which started the whole world living,

Oh, if Id only seen that the joke was on me.
I looked at the skies, running my hands over my eyes,
And I fell out of bed, hurting my head from things that Id said.

til I finally died, which started the whole world living,
Oh, if Id only seen that the joke was one me.
