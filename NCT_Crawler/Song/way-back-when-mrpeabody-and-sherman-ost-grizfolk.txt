                        Bài hát: Way Back When (Mr.Peabody And Sherman OST) - Grizfolk

There's always time for living
Can we just do it again
One more time like it once was way back when
You gave me something to believe in
We was a best of friends
Well I remember the good times...way back when
(la la la la la...la)
Memory will fade if you wanted me to let you go
(la la la....la)
I've got you on your way,
I feel it for you don't you know
We're superheroes and villains
When we used to pretend 
We go wherever our minds will take us...way back when 
(la la la la la...la)
Memory will fade if you wanted me to let you go
I've got you on your way,
I feel it for you don't you know
(la la la la la...la)
It's a promise that i made, never be afraid 
(la la la la la...la)
I know we'll be okay, this luck we have it cannot go 
ahhhhh oo, ahhh oo
And you're on own,
Ahhhh oo, ahh oo 
You not alone 
Ahhhh oo, ahh oo 
I know i see you again, again 
...
And if all these thing 
...
Come to an end 
...
We'll always have...a way back when 
(la la la la la...la)
Memory will fade if you wanted me to let you go
(la la la....la)
I've got you on your way,
I feel it for you don't you know
(la la la la la...la)
It's a promise that i made, never be afraid 
(la la la la la...la)
I know we'll be okay, this luck we have it cannot go
                        
                    |
