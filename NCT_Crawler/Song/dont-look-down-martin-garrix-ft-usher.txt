                        Bài hát: Don't Look Down - Martin Garrix, Usher

Is your head spinning?
Is your heart racing?
Is there fire in your veins?
Are your bones burning?
Is your skin yearning?
'Cause you're driving me insane

I kinda feel like I feel like I saw the light
You got me way up a thousand miles
Can we stay right here in this atmosphere
Like we're flying in outer space
Don't look down

Up this high, we'll never hit the ground
Don't look down
See that sky, we're gonna reach it now
Do you feel the lightning inside of you
Will you follow through if I fall for you?
Don't look down

Up this high, we'll never hit the ground
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Are your hands shaking?
Are your fears breaking?
Are you climbing all the walls?

Are the times changing?
Is the noise fading?
'Cause I wanna get it all
I kinda feel like I feel like I saw the light
You got me way up a thousand miles
Can we stay right here in this atmosphere
Or are you afraid to fall?

Don't look down
Up this high, we'll never hit the ground
Don't look down
See that sky, we're gonna reach it now
Do you feel the lightning inside of you
Will you follow through if I fall for you?
Don't look down
Up this high, we'll never hit the ground

Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh.
Don't look down
Do you feel the lightning inside of you
Will you follow through if I fall for you?
Don't look down
Up this high, we'll never hit the ground
                        
                    |
