                        Bài hát: Kiss The Sky - The Knocks, Wyclef Jean

Popping out here when I met you
Surely on the long decision
Told her I'm a boppin'
But I only got the best intention
Off the tougher, not a bluffer
I want you to be my lover,
We don't have to take it undercover
Just under the cover
Bells are ringing, people singing
I'm just throwing flowers bringing
??? when we going
And I'll take you to a place
That you didn't even know exist
What's your wish, then I dive for tower apartments

Shawty's in the biz for partying
Turn into the crib is partying
Never seen my baby coming
Just one hit and we went up
My love a tripping
Now I feel my body drifting
Here we go, she got the lifting
Am I addicted?

She's so fly
Excuse her while she kiss the sky
Excuse her while she kiss the sky
She's so fly
Excuse her while she kiss the sky
Excuse her while she kiss the sky

Jaws droppin' when she walking
Kind of thing that happen often
More than just a little
I be shitting on the city block
The ladies gives what she wait
See that's not the end of here
Fresher we fall yeah, pour money in the air
'Cause I be with my lady, all the girls they wanna hate her
It comes with the territory,
Ball players wanna date her
All we got is royalty, I'm treating you like royalty

Shawty's in the biz for partying
Turn into the crib is partying
Never seen my baby coming
Just one hit and we went up
My love a tripping
Now I feel my body drifting
Here we go, she got the lifting
Am I addicted?

She's so fly
Excuse her while she kiss the sky
Excuse her while she kiss the sky
She's so fly
Excuse her while she kiss the sky
Excuse her while she kiss the sky

Hey baby, baby, hey baby
Hey baby, baby, hey baby
Take a breathe, inhale, exhale
Now breathe, baby
Hey baby, baby, hey baby
Hey baby, baby, hey baby
Inhale, exhale
Let's take a breath baby

(x2)
She's so fly
Excuse her while she kiss the sky
Excuse her while she kiss the sky
She's so fly
Excuse her while she kiss the sky
Excuse her while she kiss the sky
