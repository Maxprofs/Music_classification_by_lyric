                        Bài hát: Wasted Love - Alyssa Bernal 

You give me hope, then you rip it away
from my hands that you hold.
Get up and go is what I'm telling myself but i don't.

I've been let down, I've been kicked around.
You're the same damn rock that took me out.
And I'm so lost. Yeah, I can't be found.
Cause you got me circling around.

(chorus)
You don't see me the way I see you.
The pain in my chest, it could kill me.
The love we make, it just goes to waste.
Like a muted symphony.
Always a fight, not eye to eye.
It's just a wasted love.
It doesn't feel right (feel right).

I get so close, but then you go.
It's just a wasted love.
It doesn't feel right.

(verse 2)
Don't let it show that I'm dying to stay by your side.
And hear your lies. I let you in.
Now I'm begging for you not to leave me with nothing.

I've been shut down, got the run around.
You're in my head, can't get you out.
And I'm so lost, got no control.
And here I stay, I can't say no.

(chorus)

All my love, all my love.
It's all gone, gone, gone, gone.

You don't see me the way I see you

You don't see me the way I see you
The pain in my chest, it could kill me
The love we make, it just goes to waste
like a muted symphony

Wasted love x5
Get up and go!
                        
                    |
