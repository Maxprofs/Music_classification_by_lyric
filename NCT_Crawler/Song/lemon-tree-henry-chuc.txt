                        Song: Lemon Tree - Henry Chúc

I'm setting here
In the boring room
It's just another rain
Sunday afternoon.

I'm wasting my time
I got nothing to do
I'm happing for you
But nothing ever happens and I wonder

I'm driving around in my car
I'm driving too fast
I'm driving too far
I'd like to change
My poin of view
I feed so lonely
I'm waiting for you
But nothing ever happens and I wonder

I wonder how
I wonder why
Yesterday you told me
About the blue blue sky.

And all that I can see is
Just a yellow lemon tree
I'm turning my head up and down
I'm turning turning around
And all that I can lemon tree.

I'm sitting here
I miss the power
I'd like to go out taking a should
But there's a heavy cloud.

Inside my head
I feed so tired
Put my self into bed
Well , nothing ever happens and I wonder.

Isolation is not food for me
Isolotion I don't want
to sit on the lemon tree
I'm steppin's around.

In the deser of joy
Baby anyhow Iw'll get another toy
And every thing will happen
And you wonder.

And all that I can see is
Just a yellow lemon tree
I'm turning my head up and down
I'm turning turning around
And all that I can lemon tree.
                        
                    |
