Top down, on the strip
Lookin in the mirror and
I'm checkin out my lipstick
Girlfriends up in the back
Were out partin all night
Feelin so crazy cool
Don't know what they're ready for
Valet baby, here the keys
We're about to step inside
Skip on the drinks
Head to the floor
Makin my way past the show
My body's taken over
And I want some more
Woah yeah ay yeah

I wanna rock with you (rock with you)
You're feelin this way

Step up baby don't be shy

Don't wanna play around
Baby watch me one more round

To the DJ's sound
