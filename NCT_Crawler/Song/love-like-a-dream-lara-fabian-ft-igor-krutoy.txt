                        A dream-like love

I can see myself in your eyes like in a mirror,
 I am afraid to lose my reflection.
 I don't want you to be just a guest
 In the darkness of the night and in my destiny.
 I love you like you only love once,
 As though there was no sun in the world until us.
 You took me away from worries and bickering
 And found the keys for my happiness.
 you found them for me.

A dream-like love,
 The hearts echo to each other like crystals
 Your magical "I love you" -
 I will echo it.
 A dream-like love
 Has made my home happy,
 But against the laws of dreams,
 may it never end.

I forgive Loneliness and Sadness,
 You said that I won't ever come back to them.
 This only happens in a sweet dream.
 But love for us is real now,
 Not to lose myself in your eyes
 We won't trade love for separation,
 With an unthinkable price
 and with my dream
 I deserve this happiness of being with you.
 Always be with you.

A dream-like love,
 The hearts echo to each other like crystals
 Your magical "I love you" -
 I will echo it.
 A dream-like love
 Has made my home happy,
 But against the laws of dreams,
 May it never end.
 A dream-like love
 Has made my home happy,
 But against the laws of dreams,
 May it never end.
