                        (Chorus)
 I wanna whisper
 I wanna whisper
 I got something to say to you
 I wanna whisper in your ear (Verse)
 Today seems like a perfect day
 To say what I've been wanting to say
 Don't worry baby it's ok
 Everything is just great (Verse)
 I ain't ashamed to say how I feel
 When it comes down to you
 So many ways to comunicate
 For me it's only one way (Pre-Chorus)
 I could send it in a letter
 I could text your phone
 Hit you up on twitter 'cause you stay logged on
 Even fly a plane right there in the sky
 But it's better girl if I (Chorus)
 I wanna whisper
 I wanna whisper
 I got something to say to you
 I wanna whisper in your ear (Verse)
 Now it might be naughty to focus on your body
 But girl I'm really feeling you
 A lot of guys be jocking and they won't stop it
 And they don't need to lie I got you my baby (Verse)
 See with you baby
 I need to touch and feel you baby
 I put my arms around you
 To hold your body glued (Pre-Chorus)
 I could send it in a letter
 I could text your phone
 Hit you up on twitter 'cause you stay logged on
 Even fly a plane right there in the sky
 Girl but it's better if I (Chorus) x2
 I wanna whisper
 I wanna whisper
 I got something to say to you
 I wanna whisper in your ear Wanna tell you babe
 Oh ye girl
 Coming in with me tonight ye
 Come with me right now, right now my baby
 Say the word yeeeee (Chorus)
 I wanna whisper
 I wanna whisper
 I got something to say to you
 I wanna whisper in your ear
                        
                    |
