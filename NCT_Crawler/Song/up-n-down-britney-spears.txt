Down and up
And down and up
And down and up and down

Down and up
And down and up
And down and up and down

I got all tricked out
when I came up to this thing
Lookin' so fire hot,
a twenty out of ten
I saw you watchin' me
watchin' you on the floor
Hittin' me up like "What you waitin' for?"

It's alright to say you want it
Get inside my dirty mind
Burns like ice
The way I bring it again
and again and again all night

The beat just dropped
and the room got sexy
You're watchin' me
like there's no one else around
I know you want me
like kids want candy
So keep watchin' me go down
and up and down

Down and up
And down and up
And down and up and down

Down and up
And down and up
And down and up and down

All of dem girls you
with they probably hatin' me
But I don't care
because I know it's jealousy
They see me on you
like they think I'll give it up-up-up
But I ain't easy, just not afraid to rush

It's alright to say you want it
Get inside my dirty mind
Burns like ice
The way I bring it again
and again and again all night

The beat just dropped
and the room got sexy
You're watchin' me
like there's no one else around
I know you want me
like kids want candy
So keep watchin' me go down
and up and down

Down and up
And down and up
And down and up and down

Down and up
And down and up
And down and up and down

Down and up
And down and up
And down and up and down

Down and up
And down and up
And down and up and down

I can almost feel my lace
Slippin' off cause of the bass
I can tell that's
what you're trippin' on, trippin' on

I can almost feel my lace
Slippin' off cause of the bass
I can tell that's
what you're trippin' on, trippin' on

The beat just dropped
and the room got sexy
You're watchin' me
like there's no one else around
I know you want me
like kids want candy
So keep watchin' me go down
and up and down

The beat just dropped
and the room got sexy
You're watchin' me
like there's no one else around
I know you want me
like kids want candy
So keep watchin' me go down
and up and down
