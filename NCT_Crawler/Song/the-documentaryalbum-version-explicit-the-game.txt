 [Verse 1 - Game (Dre)]

 What happened in hip hop
 That got 'Pac and Big shot
 The thicks blocks
 Now every rapper claim
 He let his clip pop
 But even myself told the gun
 To know to run then get shot
 I've been there before
 Now I'm ***in with doc
 (Gotta do them Calvin Broadus numbers)
 If not I push rocks
 Anticipatin' my incarceration
 Media think I'm fakin' like mason
 But when it comes to mace
 *** are. Kelly I don't take it in the face
 I find out who sprayed it
 And I'm putting you under the pavement
 No buddhist priest, catholic, or baptist pastor can save him
 I'm far from religious
 But I got beliefs, so I put
 Cannary yellow diamonds
 In my jesus piece
 I came back from the dead
 Without a part of my chest
 Layed in a hospital bed on cardiac arrest
 I waited for 3 years
 While everyone else dropped
 Now I understand why nas
 Did a song with his pops

 [Chorus x2]

 I'm ready to die
 Without a reasonable doubt
 Smoke chronic and hit it
 Doggy style before I go out
 Until they sign my death certificate
 All eyez on me
 I'm still at it, illmatic
 And that's the documentary

 [Verse 2:]

 If I die my niggas, *** it
 I did a song with Mary Blige, my niggas
 Got a hook from Faith
 No verse from Jay
 I guess on westside story
 He thought I spit in his face
 I told Ed and Money Love
 I was talkin to Ja
 With that Maybach line
 It was payback time
 Keep ***in with me nigga
 I'll put you under me
 Take your car and trade it in
 For eight 300Z's
 If you cross my T
 I dot your I's
 You'd do life in a cementary
 I'll do mine with Shyne
 Come home sit in the thrown
 With my legs crossed
 And my air force
 Middle finger up
 *** the world
 Cause I'm feelin' like puff
 When life after death hit
 Mo' money, mo' problems
 And I lost my best friend
 I'm the second dopest nigga
 From Compton you'll ever hear
 The first nigga only put out albums
 Every 7 years (haha)

 [Game (Commentator)]
 (You know what speakin of Jay
 That just makes me roll down
 Now your song westside story)
 Ohh Ohh
 (You got a line that says
 Don't wear throwbacks
 Or drive, ride in maybachs,
 Is that a shot at Jay?)
 Naa, I was talkin about Ja Rule
 Yeah, So, Yeah, I got a lot of
 Respect for Jay
 You know what I'm saying
 I never take shots at legends
 That's just something I don't do

 [Verse 3 - Game (Busta)]
 Let me tell you why I do this ***
 I'm a son of a gun
 Cause moms was a hoover crip
 First day I got signed
 I had to prove I spit
 Freestyled with Busta Rhymes
 (Son, dude is sick)
 Prodigy of Doc Dre.
 I could finally put the shoes on
 Now that the rumours of Rakim and Cube gone,
 They say truth hurts
 Chunk, like quick sand
 Don't stop me in traffic
 And ask about Hitman
 I gotta restore the feelin
 It crawled from under the rock
 After the dog pound
 Crushed the buildings
 I got a family to feed
 I'm the middle of 9 children
 We can talk about a loan
 After I sell 5 million
 If I tell you I ain't game
 And I don't know Dre.
 You gonn do me like Xzibit
 And cut half of my face?
 I take all the credit
 For putting the west
 Back on the map
 If you aint feelin that
 Go sign Guerilla Black!!!

 [Chorus x2]
