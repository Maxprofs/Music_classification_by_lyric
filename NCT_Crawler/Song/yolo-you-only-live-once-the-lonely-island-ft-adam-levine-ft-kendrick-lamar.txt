                        Adam Levine: YOLO

Andy: YOLO, you only live once.

The battle cry of a generation.
This life is a precious gift.
So don't get too crazy, 
it's not worth the risk.

Chorus

Adam Levine: 
You know that we are still young.
So don't be dumb.
Don't trust anyone,
cause you only live once.

Verse 1

Kiv: Ugh, you only live once, 
thats the motto.
So take a chill pill, 
ease off the throttle.

Jorm: Never go to loud clubs 
cause it's bad for your ears.
Your friends will all be sorry
when they can't hear.

Andy: And stay the hell away from drugs 
cause they not legal.
Then bury all your money in the backyard
like a beagle.

Kiv: Cause you should never trust a bank
They've been known to fail.
And never travel by car, a bus, 
boat or by rail.

Jorm: And don't travel by plane.
And don't travel at all.
Build a bomb shelter basement
with titanium walls.

Andy: And wear titanium suits 
in case pianos fall on ya.
And never go in saunas 
cause they're crawlin' with piranhas. 

Kiv: And never take the stairs
cause they're often unsafe.
You only live once, 
don't let it go to waste.

CHORUS

Adam Levine:
You know that we are still young,
so hold off on the fun.
Cook your meat 'til it's done, 
cause you only live once.

Verse 2

Jorm: Yeah, 
and here's another piece of advice: 
Stay away from kids 
cause their hair is filled with mad lice.

Andy: There's no such thing
as too much Purell.
This a cautionary tale,
word to George Orwell.

Kiv: So don't 1980 force
any plugs into sockets.
Always wear a chastity belt 
and triple lock it.

Jorm: Then hire a taster
make him check your food for poison.
And if you think your mailman is a spy 
then destroy him.

Andy: No blankets or pajamas
they can choke you in your sleep.
Two words about furniture:
killing machines.

Kiv: Board your windows up
the sun is bad for your health.
And always wear a straight jacket
so you're safe from yourself.

Kendrick Lamar: 
Take no chances (no chances)
Stop freelancin' (right now)
Invest in your future, 
don't dilute your finances (uh huh)
401K, make sure it's low risk
Then get some real estate (how much?) 
4.2%Thirty year mortgage, 
that's important, that's a great deal
And if you can't afford it, 
don't forge it on your last bill
Renting is for suckers right now
A dependable savings, 
and you'll retire with money in your account.
Beast.

All: 
YOLO, say no no.
Isolate yourself 
and just roll solo
Be care-folo
You oughta look out 
also stands for YOLO.

Chorus

Adam Levine:
You know that we are still young. 
Burn the prints off your thumbs.
Then pull out all your teeth, 
so you can't bite your tongue.

Only on this earth for a short time, time
So don't go outside, cause you don't want to die, die.

Just take our advice and hide
and scream YOLO to the sky.

Andy: You oughta look out.
                        
                    |
