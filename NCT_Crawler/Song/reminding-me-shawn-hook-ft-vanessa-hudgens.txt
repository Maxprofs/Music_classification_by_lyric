                        Bài hát: Reminding Me - Shawn Hook, Vanessa Hudgens

[Shawn Hook & Vanessa Hudgens:]
She keeps reminding me
That you're still gone
And I'm still lonely
He keeps reminding me
How good it was
When we were crazy

[Shawn Hook:]
Wine, she's spitting out the wine
I forgot you left behind
Our favorite cherry red
Oh, love, I know this isn't love
Cause I'm still thinking of you
While she's getting undressed
I never should have left

She keeps reminding me
That you're still gone
And I'm still lonely
She keeps reminding me
How good it was
When we were crazy

In lo-ove
Lo-ove
She keeps reminding me
How good it wa-as
Wa-as
She keeps reminding me

[Vanessa Hudgens:]
Nights, I miss the faded nights
Staying out 'til morning light
Having breakfast in bed
Now he, he's laying in the sheets
The ones you bought for me
All tangled in a mess
It should be you instead

He keeps reminding me
That you're still gone
And I'm still lonely
He keeps reminding me
How good it was
When we were crazy

In lo-ove
Lo-ove
He keeps reminding me
How good it wa-as
Wa-as
He keeps reminding me

[Shawn Hook & Vanessa Hudgens:]
I'm tryna' forget you
With some of regrets
But I'm still hanging onto
The memories that you left
I deleted your number
With every text
I'm still tryna' forget you
Forget you

She keeps reminding me
That you're still gone
And I'm still lonely
He keeps reminding me
How good it was
When we were crazy

She keeps reminding me
That you're still gone
And I'm still lonely
He keeps reminding me
How good it was
When we were crazy

In lo-ove
Lo-ove
She keeps reminding me
How good it wa-as
Wa-as
She keeps reminding me

[Shawn Hook:]
Wine, she's spitting out the wine
I forgot you left behind
                        
                    |
