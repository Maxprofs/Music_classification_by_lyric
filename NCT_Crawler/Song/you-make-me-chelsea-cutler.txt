                        Bài hát: You Make Me - Chelsea Cutler

[Verse 1]
Babe you know that we don't gotta fight tonight
I promise in the morning everything will be alright, yeah
Let's hang all of our dirty laundry out to dry
I promise in the morning everything will be just fine

[Pre-Chorus]
Call me, it's always 2AM when you call me
When you know that I don't wanna be lonely
And I could use a hit of your crazy, yeah
Love me, I hate the way you know how to love me
Can’t help that you're the one and the only
One I wanna wake up with

[Chorus]
Oh, you make me go insane, but that's how I want it
Oh, with every word you say you keep me falling
I'm addicted to the high I get with you
And I can't stop won't let go
Oh, you make me go insane, but that's how I want it

[Verse 2]
Babe you know that I don't wanna compromise
I promise in the morning everything will be alright, yeah
I swear I told you half a hundred times that I
I wouldn't ride the wave if I ain't got you by my side

[Pre-Chorus]
Call me, it's always 2AM when you call me
When you know that I don't wanna be lonely
And I could use a hit of your crazy, yeah
Love me, I hate the way you know how to love me
Can’t help that you're the one and the only
One I want to wake up with

[Chorus]
Oh, you make me go insane, but that's how I want it
Oh, with every word you say you keep me falling
I'm addicted to the high I get with you
And I can't stop won't let go
Oh, you make me go insane, but that's how I want it

[Bridge]
You got me so high
Baby, only you could
You set me on fire and it hurts so good
Never wanna stand back where I stood
You set me on fire and it hurts so good

[Pre-Chorus 2]
We don't gotta fight tonight
I promise in the morning everything will be alright, yeah

[Chorus]
Oh, you make me go insane, but that's how I want it
Oh, with every word you say you keep me falling
I'm addicted to the high I get with you
And I can't stop won't let go
Oh, you make me go insane, but that's how I want it
