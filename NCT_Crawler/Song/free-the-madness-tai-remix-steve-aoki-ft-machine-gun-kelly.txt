                        Bài hát: Free The Madness (TAI Remix) - Steve Aoki, Machine Gun Kelly

If our love fades and the children age
And the love we share separates
In a perfect world do we know we're done
I don't wanna grow up, that's already won

I wanna be in love with the city now
I wanna take control
*** madness in my mind

FREE YOUR MIND
Free, free your mind
FREE YOUR MIND
Free, free your mind
FREE YOUR MIND
Free, free your mind
FREE YOUR MIND
Free, free your mind

Chills
And if tomorrow I wake up and I'm sixty years old
I hope when I look in the mirror and ask how you lived
I look right and back and say, "***, you tell me!"

So I smoke this herb with my homies
Couldn't afford a roof over my head
But I let that bitch burn with my homies
We're living life in the moment
Walk in this bitch like we own this
Screaming that *** the world to this moment
And if I can free this
Madness, stop the screaming!
Inside of my mind it's freedom
And it's magic, a perfect giving
All I do is have a little sunlight
All I wanna do is drink a little moonshine
You can show me what a *** I'm doing right
And don't nobody wanna have a good time

I wish I can see this
I wish I can free this
*** MADNESS IN MY MIND
