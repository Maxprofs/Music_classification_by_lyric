                        Bài hát : Because Of You (My Little Princess OST) - BY2

I'm gonna be fine 
You left me alone 
Can I heal the wounds myself 
So what can I do 
And why did you come 
To make my heart beat for you 
Don't , don't lose my mind 
Dream of you again 
And I look to you as it fell 
I want to make a wish in the well 
Hold me tight show your love 
Everytime I trade my sold because of you 
If you wanna be in my way cuz of me 
The stars 
Were shinning to me away 
Whispering I want you to know you're my world 
Everytime I crazy is because of you 
If you're looking right at me because of love 
To me it's a pretty wonderland 
Do not make me make me cry again 
I need you right now 
I'm gonna be fine 
You left me alone 
Can I heal the wounds myself 
So what can I do 
And why did you come 
To make my heart beat for you 
Don't , don't lose my mind 
Dream of you again 
And I look to you as it fell 
I want to make a wish in the well 
Hold me tight show your love 
Everytime I'm crazy is because of you 
If you're looking right at me because of love 
To me it's a pretty wonderland 
Do not make me make me cry again 
I need you right now 
Hey boy do not be shy 
Why not we have a try 
Stay next to me, push the bad memories aside 
Put me in the palm of you 
All my life time I will be thinking of you 
Everytime I'm trade my sold because of you 
If you wanna be in my way cuz of me 
The stars 
Were shinning to me away 
whispering I want you to know you're my world 
Everytime I'm crazy is because of you 
If you're looking right at me because of love 
To me it's a pretty wonderland 
Do not make me make me cry again 
I need you right now
