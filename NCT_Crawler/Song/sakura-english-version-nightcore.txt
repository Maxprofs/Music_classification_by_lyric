                        Bài hát: Sakura (English Version) - Nightcore

Sakura when I see it all hit the ground 
My heart gets weak 
'Cause that dream that you and I had made 
Is still so clear in me 
And I wonder if that day will come 
Where we could make it real 
Baby will I ever see you 
Sakura will I breathe again 

I keep imagining you in front of me 
Everywhere I go, I find 
Myself back in time with you 
Can't help remembering 
And I keep looking out my window 
Hoping you would come home 
Even though we said it was over 
I can still hear your voice 
I try to tell you that I'm doing alright 
Even though my heart is feeling so tight 
But I'm feeling so alone in this 
And life's not right without you 
Each day it gets harder and 
I wish that I could say I love you 
All over again 
Can't you see 
What we used to be 


Sakura when I see it all hit the ground 
My heart gets weak 
'Cause that dream that you and I had made 
Is still so clear in me 
And I wonder if that day will come 
Where we could make it real 
Baby will I ever see you 
Sakura will I breathe again 

Getting over you I couldn't do 
Lying to myself I can't 
Keep living like this never happened 
Can't get it out my mind 
Will we ever be back in love again 
Faith is all I have and now 
As I watch another season go 
What am I waiting for 
I try to tell you that I'm doing alright 
Even though my heart is feeling so tight 
But I'm feeling so alone in this. 


Sakura when I see it all hit the ground 
My heart gets weak 
'Cause that dream that you and I had made 
Is still so clear in me 
And I wonder if that day will come 
Where we could make it real 
Baby will I ever see you 
Sakura will I breathe again
