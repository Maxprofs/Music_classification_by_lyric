                        Bài hát: Party Ain't Over - Pitbull, Usher, Afrojack

The party ain't over, the party ain't over
 The party ain't over
 It's three a.m. and it's too many women
 She's just beginning the time of her life
 So tell the DJ, J, J, J, J
 Turn the mother***er up, up, up, up, up
 Yeah, mister bartender, tender, tender, tender
 Pour me another cup, cup, cup, cup
 Get *** up! From the MIA, to the ATL, to the world, DALE! Party ain't over till the fat lady sings
 Or should I see, party ain't over till you so *** drunk
 That that fat lady stand, dale gordita Qué rica
 Catch me like in a fool and a donkey
 All in one in regard, yeah they hot, yeah they fire
 But even the devil knows I'm hotter
 Ay, dios
 See me, yeah, 3D, yeah, yeah, yeah with no glasses
