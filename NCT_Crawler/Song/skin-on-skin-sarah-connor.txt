                        Skin on Skin ( sarah conner )

[intro]
Just a little bit more love
Just a little bit more passion
This is how it should begin
Skin on skin

[verse 1]
If you leave me now
Telling me you failed somehow
Better think it all over
Just as long as love’s around
Here’s a true romance
Be aware and take your chance
Tomorrow I’m gonna leave you
But I am here for you tonight

[bridge]
Every single day I want you to know
My love is true
So baby let me show you what to do

[chorus]
Just a little bit more love
Just a little bit more passion
This is how it should begin
Skin on skin

Just a little getting close
Just a little more affection
’cause I don’t think it’s a sin
Skin on skin

Don’t you know that this game is to play
Just as long as it’s time
Can’t you see that my heart’s gotta know
When you’re gonna be mine

Just a little more love
Just a little more love

[verse 2]
So we better get it on
What is here will soon be gone
When the leaves are falling
Then maybe we could fall apart

[bridge 2]
And there may come a time
When you will forget
My love is true
So baby let me show you what to do
