                        How dare you stand and wait on the far side of the river bank, like I would open up the gate to a man who bares a stranger's face, a stranger's face How dare you wander round throwing stones like i'm to blame, I'm the one who wears the crown who are you to call my name, call my name Ooh, you've lost your native skin
 Ooh, you've lost your native skin
 Ooh, you've lost your native skin
 Ooh, you've lost your native skin There ain't no wall to buy the light of the full moon,
 you can't avoid it the struggle on the surface Or tell me what you see, cause I see you do you see me, there ain't order there's a creature with a traitor's face, yeah, yeah Ooh, you've lost your native skin
 Ooh, you've lost your native skin
 Ooh, you've lost your native skin
 Ooh, you've lost your native skin
 Ooh.... Reaching for the soil with, two hands
 Holding to the memory, three hands
 Clawing at the colonel, desperately searching for reason it was worth it all Reaching for the soil with, two hands
 Holding to the memory, three hands
 Clawing at the colonel, desperately searching for reason it was worth it all Reaching for the soil with, two hands
 Holding to the memory, three hands
 Clawing at the colonel, desperately searching for reason it was worth it all
