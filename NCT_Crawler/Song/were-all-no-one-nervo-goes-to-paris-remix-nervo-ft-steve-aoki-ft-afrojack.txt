                        Bài hát: We're All No One (Nervo Goes To Paris Remix) - Nervo, Steve Aoki, Afrojack

You do your best,
You take the fall,
You reminisce,
About almost nearly having it all.
You see the stars,
You try and catch one,
Oh, you tried so hard,
Chasing nothing,

Because
We're all no one 'til someone thinks that we're someone
Until then we are no one
And you got me looking at you, looking at you
I said we're all no one 'til someone thinks that we're someone
Until then we are no one
And you got me looking at you, looking at you

We're all the same
We all have hopes
Oh, it gets insane
When you're slipping down that downwards slope
I come with peace
I offer love
So if you're hearing me
Then hurry baby give it up

Because
We're all no one 'til someone thinks that we're someone
Until then we are no one
And you got me looking at you, looking at you
I said we're all no one 'til someone thinks that we're someone
Until then we are no one
And you got me looking at you,
I said we're all no one 'til someone thinks that we're someone

Oh, come on
Oh, come on

Do ya best [repeat]

We're all no one 'til someone thinks that we're someone
Until then we are no one
And you got me looking at you, looking at you
I said we're all no one 'til someone thinks that we're someone
Until then we are no one
And you got me looking at you
                        
                    |
