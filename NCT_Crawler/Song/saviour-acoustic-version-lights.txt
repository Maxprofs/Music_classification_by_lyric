                        Bài hát: Saviour (Acoustic Version) - Lights

The night is deafening
when the silence is listening
and I'm down on my knees 
and I know that something is missing 
because the back of my mind is holding things I'm relying in 
but I choose to ignore it because I'm always denying them 

I'm a bit of a manic when it's not as I plan it 
'cause I start losing my head then I get up in a panic
Remember, when we were kids and always knew when to quit it 
Are we denying a crisis or are we scared of admitting it?

I don't want to know

I just wanna run to you
and break off the chains
and throw them away
I just wanna be so much
and shake off the dust 
that turn me to rust
Sooner than later, I'll need a saviour
I need a saviour 

It will never change
if you want it to stay the same
I really hate it
but I know it's hard to choose if you're chained
and when it's all you control 
'cause you got nothing else to hold 
You're getting tighter and tighter 
It's getting harder to let it go 

I don't want to know

I just wanna run to you
and break off the chains
and throw them away
I just wanna be so much
and shake off the dust 
that turn me to rust
Sooner than later, I'll need a saviour
I need a saviour 

Stand me up and maybe I won't be so small
Free my hands and feet
and maybe I won't always fall
Save me

I just wanna run to you
and break off the chains
(Save me)
and throw them away
I just wanna be so much
and shake off the dust
(Save me) 
that turn me to rust

I just wanna run to you
(Just wanna run to you)
and break off the chains
(Save me)
and throw them away
I just wanna be so much
(Just wanna be so much)
and shake off the dust 
(Save me)
that turn me to rust
Sooner than later, 
I'll need a saviour
(Save me)
I need a saviour
                        
                    |
