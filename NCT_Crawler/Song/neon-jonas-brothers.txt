                        "Neon"

Stars fade
Hearts break
Fair trade
Is it ever even
Don't wait to stay awake
When you realize
That time just keeps on moving
While you're standing next to living in the dark

So neon, neon
Burn up the sky, just like a fantasy where all I can see is
Neon, neon
Show me your light
I'm running out of time
So give me a sign
Neon, neon, neon
Give me a sign, neon, neon, neon
Give me a sign, neon
Sun set
Street red
Lights they
Always call my name
Then I
Don't want more time
Won't feel it
That time just keeps on moving
While you're standing next to living in the dark
So neon, neon
Burn up the sky, just like a fantasy where all I can see is
Neon, neon
Show me your light
I'm running out of time
So give me a sign
Neon, neon, neon
Give me a sign, neon, neon, neon
Give me a sign, neon
Show me your light
I am running out of time
Give me a sign neon
Neon, neon, neon
Give me a sign, neon, neon, neon
Give me a sign, neon
Yeah-e-yeah
I've been looking for the reason
It's the answer of the meaning of it all
All
Hope tonight you're gonna show me just
You're always here glowing in the dark
Yeah

Oh neon
Neon
Burn up the sky, just like a fantasy where all I can see is
Neon, neon
Show me your light
I am running out of time
Give me a sign neon
Neon, neon, neon
Give me a sign, neon, neon, neon
Give me a sign, neon
I am running out of time
Give me a sign neon
