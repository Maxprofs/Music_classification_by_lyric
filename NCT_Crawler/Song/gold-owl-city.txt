                        Bài hát: Gold - Owl City

Standing open take a bow 
There is something there and it’s showing 
There is no need to look around, you are the best we got going 
Shout out to the dreams you chase 
Shout out to the heart you break 
Nothing is gonna stop you know 
I guess you better be going 
You”ll never be far 
I”m keeping you near, inside of my heart, you’re hear 
Go On 
Is gotta be time 
You’re staring to shine 
‘Cause what you’ve got it 
(Gold oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh) 
I know, you’re gold 
(Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh) 
I know i know 
I don’t even need stars in the night 
I’ve found my treasure 
All i need is you by my side 
So shine forever 
(Gold oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh) 
i know you’re gold 
(Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh) 
i know you’re gold 
It won’t take you long to get 
When you feel like you are soaring .. 
So ride it on and don’t forget, you gotta tell us your story 
Shout out to the friends back home 
Shout out to the hearts you have known 
You gave them nothing but the best 
(Yeah) 
And you can tell them your story 
You”ll never be far 
I’m keeping you near 
Inside of my heart 
You’re here 
Go On 
It’s gotta be time, you’re staring to shine 
‘Cause what you have got is 
(Gold oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh) 
I know, you’re gold 
(Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh) 
I know i know 
I don’t even need stars in the night 
I have found my treasure 
All i need is you by my side 
So shine forever 
(Gold oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh) 
I know you’re gold 
(Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh) 
I know you’re gold 

‘Cause what you have got is 
(Gold oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh) 
I know you’re gold 
(Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh) 
I know i know 
I don’t even need stars in the night 

I’ve found my treasure 
All i need is you by my side 
So shine forever 
(Gold oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh) 
I know you’re gold 
(Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh) 
I know you’re gold 
You’re gold
