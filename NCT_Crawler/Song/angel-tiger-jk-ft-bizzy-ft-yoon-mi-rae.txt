You will always be my
You will always be my

You are my angel, putting a smile on my face when I’m sad
No matter what anyone says, it’s you (you) you melt my heart, I love you (you)
Cause you will always be my
You are my angel, putting a smile on my face when I’m sad
No matter what anyone says, it’s you (you) you melt my heart, I love you (you)
Cause you will always be my

Eight birthdays on leap months, several moments of crisis in my life
I walked through my tumultuous life, I start talking to the sky drunk
Picking a fight with God, saying harsh things because of my gloomy future
Dreams that I secretly trembled for, during my immature days
They were just faraway dreams, extravagances for the penniless me
Then you came to me, you came to me
Just like Taeyang, I’m only looking at you
You’re only looking at me

You are my angel, putting a smile on my face when I’m sad
No matter what anyone says, it’s you (you) you melt my heart, I love you (you)
Cause you will always be my
You are my angel, putting a smile on my face when I’m sad
No matter what anyone says, it’s you (you) you melt my heart, I love you (you)
Cause you will always be my

1 2 3 4 5 6 7, fall seven times but get back on my eighth, even on this uphill road
I go up but I fall head first, crowds of people that I call friends laugh at me, pointing fingers
As I looked at those hotshots, I grinded my teeth, that’s how I lived
Even my soul closed its eyes, even my shadow got lazy
But then you knew my heart, you embraced me
Angel my angel, you make me smile
I can do anything for you, I can even build a house
My angel, my angel, you make me smile
I can do anything for you, I can even build a house

You are my angel, putting a smile on my face when I’m sad
No matter what anyone says, it’s you (you) you melt my heart, I love you (you)
Cause you will always be my
You are my angel, putting a smile on my face when I’m sad
No matter what anyone says, it’s you (you) you melt my heart, I love you (you)
Cause you will always be my

A smile spreads across my face
No matter what they say
Imma hold you closer
A smile spreads across my face
No matter what they say
Imma hold you closer

Used to be a silly bum
I was so tired
Struggling and fallen
But you put wings on me
Used to be a silly bum
I was so tired
Struggling and fallen
But you put wings on me

You are my angel, putting a smile on my face when I’m sad
No matter what anyone says, it’s you (you) you melt my heart, I love you (you)
Cause you will always be my
You are my angel, putting a smile on my face when I’m sad
No matter what anyone says, it’s you (you) you melt my heart, I love you (you)
Cause you will always be my

You are my angel, putting a smile on my face when I’m sad
No matter what anyone says, it’s you (you) you melt my heart, I love you (you)
Cause you will always be my
You are my angel, putting a smile on my face when I’m sad
No matter what anyone says, it’s you (you) you melt my heart, I love you (you)
Cause you will always be my
