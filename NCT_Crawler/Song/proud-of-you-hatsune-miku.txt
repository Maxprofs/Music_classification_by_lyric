                        Bài hát: Proud Of You - Hatsune Miku

Till the end of life
Hold me up hold me tight
Lift me up to touch the sky
Teaching me to love with heart
Helping me open my mind
I can fly
I'm proud that i can fly
To give the best of mine
Till the end of the time
Believe me i can fly
I'm proud that i can fly
To give the best of mine
The heaven in the sky

3. Can't you believe that you light up my way
No matter how that ease my path
I'll never lose my faith
see my fly
I'm proud to fly up hight
Show you the best of mine
Till the end of the time
Believe me i can fly
I'm singing in the sky
Show you the best of mine
The heaven in the sky
Nothing can stop me
Spread my wings so side
                        
                    |
