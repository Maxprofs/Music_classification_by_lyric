                        My sex
 Waits for me
 Like a mongrel waits
 Downwind on a tight rope leash My sex
 Is a fragile acrobat
 Sometimes I'm a Novocaine shot
 Sometimes I'm an automat My sex
 Is often solo
 Sometimes it short circuits then
 Sometimes it's a golden glow My sex
 Is invested in
 Suburban photographs
 Skyscraper shadows on a car crash overpass My sex
 Is savage, tender
 It wears no future faces
 Owns just random gender My sex
 Has a wanting wardrobe
 I still explore
 Of all the bodies I knew and those I want to know My sex
 Is a spark of electro flesh
 Leased from the tick of time
 And geared for synchromesh My sex
 Is an image lost in faded films
 A neon outline
 On a high-rise overspill My sex
 My sex
 My sex
