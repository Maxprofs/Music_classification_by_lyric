                        Bài hát: Chattahoochee - Alan Jackson

Yeah way down yonder on the chattahoochee
It gets hotter than a hoochie coochie 
We layed rubber on the georgia asphalt
We got a litte crazy but we never got caught

Down by the river on a friday night 
Pyramid of cans in the pale moonlight
Talkin' 'bout cars and dreamin 'bout women 
Never had a plan just a livin' for the minute

Yeah way down yonder on the chattahoochee
Never knew how much that muddy water meant to me 
But i learned how to swim and i learned who i was
Alot about livin' and a little 'bout love

Well we fogged up the windows in my old chevy
I was willin' but she wasn't ready
So i settled for a burger and a grape snow cone
Dropped her off early but i didn't go home

Down by the river on a friday night 
Pyramid of cans in the pale moonlight 
Talkin' bout cars and dreamin' 'bout women
Never had a plan just a livin' for the minute

Yeah way down yonder on the chattahoochee
Never knew how much that muddy water meant to me
But i learned how to swim and i learned who i was
A lot 'bout livin' and a little 'bout love

Yeah way down yonder on the chattahoochee
It gets hotter than a hoochie coochie 
We layed rubber on the georgia asphalt
We got a litte crazy but we never got caught

Well we fogged up the windows in my old chevy
I was willin' but she wasn't ready
So i settled for a burger and a grape snow cone
Dropped her off early but i didn't go home

Down by the river on a friday night 
Pyramid of cans in the pale moonlight 
Talkin' bout cars and dreamin' 'bout women
Never had a plan just a livin' for the minute

Yeah way down yonder on the chattahoochee
Never knew how much that muddy water meant to me
But i learned how to swim and i learned who i was
A lot 'bout livin' and a little 'bout love
Alot about livin' and a little 'bout love
