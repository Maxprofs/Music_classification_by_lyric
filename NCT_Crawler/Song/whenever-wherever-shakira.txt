Whenever,Wherever
Shakira

Lucky you were born that far away so
We could both make fun of distance
Lucky that I love a foreign land for
The lucky fact of your existence
Baby I would climb Andes solely
To count the freckles on you body
Never could imagine there were only
Ten million ways to love somebody
Le do le le le le, Le do le le le le
Can't you see,I'm at your feet
Whenever, Wherever
We're meant to be together
I'll be there and you'll be near
And that's the deal my dear
Thereover, Hereunder
You'll never have to wonder
We can always play by ear
But that's the deal my dear
Lucky that my lips not only mumble
They spill kisses like a fountain
Lucky that my breasts are small and humble
So you don't confuse them with mountains
Lucky that I have strong legs like my mother
To run to cover when I need it
And these two eyes that for no other
The day you leave will cry a river
Le do le le le le , Le do le le le le
At your feet ,I'm at your feet
Whenever, Wherever
We're meant to be together
I'll be there and you'll be near
And that's the deal my dear
Thereover, Hereunder
You'll never have to wonder
We can always play by ear
But,that's the deal my dear
Le do le le le le, Le do le le le le
Think out loud
Say it again
Le do le le le le
Tell me one more time
That you'll live
Lost in my eyes
Whenever, Wherever
We're meant to be together
I'll be there and you'll be near
And that's the deal my dear
Thereover, Hereunder
You've got me head over heals
There's nothing left to fear
If you really feel the I feel
Whenever, Wherever
We're meant together
I'll be ther and you'll be near
And that's the deal my dear
Thereover, Hereunder
You've got me head over heals
There's nothing left to fear
If you really feel the way I feel
                        
                    |
