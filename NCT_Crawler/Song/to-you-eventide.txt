                        Bài hát: To You - Eventide

I'm relying on your lovin’ can you lend me some
So that if im left with nothin’ at the bottom
You can be the one to come and help me up
Yea the one I got respondin’ to the callin’
When my heart is heavy you I should get to hold tight
Hard to belly all the good in the cold times
So keep me warm before the freeze of the night grows
Body heat to more degrees if we lie close
I know you know I got needs and you solve ‘em
Thru it all
You'll been there
Pullin’ for me yea
And when i’m caught up all deep in my problems
You of all 
People care
Someone I'll need

If I'm runnin’ thin on my luck
And fallin' so behind
I will need your love
So I'm holdin’ on to you

And I been the one to tell you for a minute now
That I feel like there's something in the water
If the San Andreas splits and Isla Vista drowns
Can you be there like a first responder?
Cause I think of how the day might come when I
Need you now my reign is running dry
Please allow the stars to fall in line
And we could start tomorrow thru tonight
But what's it really gonna be are we all in?
We took a minute to develop our fling yea
Nothing coming in between what's evolvin'
If you with it come and tell me one thing

If I'm burnin' thru all my luck
Don't leave my soul behind
I will need you love
So I'm holdin’ on to you
To you to you

I know you know I like that
When you lovin’ like that it’s like crack to me 
I know you know I like that
When you lovin' like that its like crack to me 
But when you gone
I don’t really like that, I’mma need you right back to me
Said if you want in the middle of it all
Know that i’ll be the one that will be
Holdin’ on to you
                        
                    |
