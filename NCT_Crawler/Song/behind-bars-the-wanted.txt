                        I feel something over me
 And try to run away from the demons that haunted me
 The key turns inside
 No place to hide
 I'm locked in no place, no place I think I could be going crazy, going crazy oh oh
 Feeling the walls come closer, bodies colder ohhhhhhh
 Cos I'm behind bars
 Cos I'm behind bars Now a whisper's calling me (calling me, calling me)
 And why does my skin crawl
 With the pain of insanity?
 The key turns inside
 No place to hide
 I'm locked in no place, no place I think I could be going crazy, going crazy oh oh
 Feeling the walls come closer, bodies colder ohhhhhhh
 Cos I'm behind bars
 Cos I'm behind bars Let me out of here
 I need somebody please I think I could be going crazy, going crazy oh oh
 Feeling the walls come closer bodies colder ohhhhh Cos I'm behind bars
 Cos I'm behind bars
 Behind bars
