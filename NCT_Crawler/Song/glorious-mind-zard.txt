                        Glorious mind glorious sky
Omoikiri naitara
Kinou made no koto ha zenbu wasureyou
Seaside moon seaside sky
Itsumademo kawaranu kokoro wo mou ichido kimi ni todoketai
Glorious mind

So give me the reason why
Leave me here alone
The reason why
I don't know how I feel

How I feel
Give me the rhythm-time
Leave me here alone
The reason why
I don't know how I feel

So must be the true baby
Shall we end then it's up to me
Tomorrow is a different day yeah
And I know when I'm ready

Glorious mind glorious sky
Omoikiri naitara
Kinou made no koto ha zenbu wasureyou
Seaside moon seaside sky
Itsumademo kawaranu kokoro wo mou ichido kimi ni todoketai
Glorious mind
