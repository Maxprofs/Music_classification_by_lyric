                        Bài hát: Too Much To Ask - Niall Horan

[Verse 1]
Waiting here for someone
Only yesterday we were on the run
You smile back at me and your face lit up the sun
Now I'm waiting here for someone

[Pre-Chorus]
And oh, love, do you feel this rough?
Why's it only you I'm thinking of

[Chorus]
My shadow's dancing
Without you for the first time
My heart is hoping
You'll walk right in tonight
Tell me there are things that you regret
'Cause if I'm being honest I ain't over you yet
It's all I'm asking
Is it too much to ask?
Is it too much to ask?

[Verse 2]
Someone's moving outside
The lights come on and down the drive
I forget you're not here when I close my eyes
Do you still think of me sometimes?

[Pre-Chorus]
And oh, love, watch the sun coming up
Don’t it feel *** up we're not in love

[Chorus]
My shadow's dancing
Without you for the first time
My heart is hoping
You'll walk right in tonight
Tell me there are things that you regret
'Cause if I'm being honest I ain't over you yet
It's all I'm asking
Is it too much to ask?

[Bridge]
My shadow's dancing
Without you for the first time
My heart is hoping
You'll walk right in tonight
Tell me there are things that you regret
'Cause if I'm being honest I ain't over you yet

[Chorus]
My shadow's dancing
Without you for the first time
My heart is hoping
You'll walk right in tonight
Tell me there are things that you regret
'Cause if I'm being honest I ain't over you yet
It's all I'm asking
Is it too much to ask?

[Outro]
It's all I'm asking
Is it too much to ask?
It's all I'm asking
Is it too much to ask?
                        
                    |
