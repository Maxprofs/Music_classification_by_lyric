                        Bài hát: Thank You For The Broken Heart - J Rice

Everything I know about love
I learned from you, from you
And everything I know about pain
I learned from you, you

You were my only, you were my first
You showed me lonely, and you took me in when I was hurt
But the most important thing you ever gave me
Was the one that hurt the most

So thank you for the broken heart, oh yeah
And thank you for the permanent scar, oh
'Cause if it wasn't for you, I might forget
How it feels to let go, and how it feels to get a brand new start
So thank you for the broken heart

I still remember when you called
And said that he didn't mean anything
How could you expect me to look at you
The same way

You were my only but not my last
You showed me lonely, and you made me put you in the past
But the most important thing you ever gave me
Was the one that hurt the most

So thank you for the broken heart, oh yeah
And thank you for the permanent scar, oh
'Cause if it wasn't for you, I might forget
How it feels to let go, and how it feels to get a brand new start
So thank you for the broken heart

And every time I find myself alone in pieces
I find myself
I'll just remember when you hurt me and I made it

So thank you for the broken heart
And thank you for the permanent scar
Cause if it wasn't for you, I wouldn't be here
With the love of my life, all my pain disappear
I've come so far
So thank you for the broken heart

I thank you, I thank you
For the broken heart, broken heart
For the broken heart

I'll never have a broken heart again
