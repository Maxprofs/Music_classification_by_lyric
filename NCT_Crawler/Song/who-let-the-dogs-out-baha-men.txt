When the party was nice, the party was jumping (hey yippie yi yo) 
And everybody having a ball (hah ho yippie yi yo) 
I tell the fellas start the name calling (yippie yi yo) 
And the girls report to the call 
The poor dog show down

She really want to skip town 
Get back off me, beast off me 
Get back you flea infested monger 

I'm gonna tell myself I might not get angry 
To any girls calling them canine (yippie yi yo) 
Tell the dummy hey man, it's part of the party (yippie yi yo) 
You fetch a women in front and her man behind (yippie yi yo) 
Her bone runs out now

Wait for y'all my dogs, the party is on 
I gotta get my girl I got my mind on 
Do you see the rays coming from my eye 
What could you be friend 
That Benji man that's breaking them down 
Me and my white short shorts 
And I can't seek a lot, any canine will do 
I'm figuring that's why they call me faithful 
'Cause I'm the man of the land 
When they see me they do ooooh
