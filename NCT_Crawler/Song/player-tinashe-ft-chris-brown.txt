                        Bài hát: Player - Tinashe, Chris Brown 

Live life like 
If I want, I do 
If I want love, I get it (get it, I get it) 
Fooled me twice 
If I fall for you 
If I go there, forget it 

So you better stay up, player 
Yeah, you better keep up, player 
Cause tonight is a game-changer 
So you better stay up, player 

Playing with fire 
If I burn, you do 
If I hurt, you won't let it (you won't let it) 
Stacked my deck like I ain't gon' lose 
Like a victim, forget it 

So you better stay up, player 
Yeah, you better keep up, player 
Cause tonight is a game-changer 
So you better stay up, up, player 

You and I make so much love 
Why you got me all *** up? 
Yeah, you got me holdin' back, holdin' back 
But it ain't enough 
You and I make so much love 
Why you got me all *** up? 
Yeah, you got me holdin' back, holdin' back 
Cause it ain't enough 

[Chris Brown] 
All right 
Baby girl, I don't want them other bitches 
You be talking that ***, calling me a player (yeah) 
Ain't no competition; *** the opposition 
I'm the man of my city, just like the mayor 
I met her in the hotel lobby, then we started loving in the elevator 
You know I had to eat that; tongue on her body; see you later, alligator 

Hurrying to her bed, smacking her on her ass 
She a stone-cold killer, 45 in the back 
Mama told her never mess with a nigga like me 
I took her to Fruit Town to meet my OG 
I took her to the west side, like "what's up? " 
We was on the east side; we *** 
Now we sitting courtside; P-dub 
Put me in the bed; you ain't gotta worry 'bout it 

(Ain't enough, ain't enough) Yeah 
(Ain't enough, ain't enough) Lord 

I been wanna give up, nah 
But you're making it rough, nah 
Bet you think you're so tough, nah 
But you gotta keep 

Yeah, you better stay up, player 
Yeah, you better keep up, player 
Cause tonight is a game-changer 
So you better stay up, up, player (up) 

You and I make so much love 
Why you got me all *** up? 
Yeah, you got me holdin' back, holdin' back 
But it ain't enough 
You and I make so much love 
Why you got me all *** up? 
Yeah, you got me holdin' back, holdin' back 
Cause it ain't enough 

You and I make so much love (I been wanna give up, nah) 
Why you got me all *** up? (But you're making it rough, nah) 
Yeah, you got me holdin' back, holdin' back (You got me) 
But it ain't enough (Holdin' back, holdin' back, back) 
You and I make so much love (I been wanna give up, nah) 
Why you got me all *** up? (But you're making it rough, nah) 
Yeah, you got me holdin' back, holdin' back 
Cause it ain't enough 

(Ain't enough) Player 
(Ain't enough)
