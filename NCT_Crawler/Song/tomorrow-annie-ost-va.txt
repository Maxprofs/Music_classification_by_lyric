                        Bài hát: Tomorrow (Annie OST) - V.A

The sun'll come out tomorrow
Bet your bottom dollar that tomorrow
There'll be sun
Just thinking about tomorrow
Clears away the cobwebs and the sorrow
'Til there's none
When I'm stuck a day that's gray
And lonely
I just stick out my chin and grin
And say, oh
The sun'll come out tomorrow
So ya gotta hang on till tomorrow
Come what may
Tomorrow, tomorrow
I love ya tomorrow
You're only a day away
Tomorrow, tomorrow
I love ya tomorrow
You're only a day away
                        
                    |
