                        Bài hát: Waka Waka (This Time For Africa) - Shakira

You're a good soldier
Choosing your battles
Pick yourself up and dust yourself off
And back in the saddle

You're on the front line
Everyone's watching
You know it's serious, we're getting closer
This isn't over

The pressure's on
You feel it
But you've got it all
Believe it

When you fall, get up, oh oh
And if you fall, get up, eh eh
Tsamina mina zangalewa
'Cause this is Africa
Tsamina mina eh eh
Waka Waka eh eh
Tsamina mina zangalewa
This time for Africa

Listen to your god
This is our motto
Your time to shine, don't wait in line
Y vamos por todo

People are raising
Their expectations
Go on and feed them, this is your moment
No hesitation

Today's your day
I feel it
You paved the way
Believe it

If you get down, get up, oh oh
When you get down, get up, eh eh

Tsamina mina zangalewa
This time for Africa
Tsamina mina e e
Waka Waka eh eh
Tsamina mina zangalewa
Anawa a a
Tsamina mina eh eh
Waka Waka eh eh
Tsamina mina zangalewa
This time for Africa

Awela majoni biggie biggie mama, one a to zet
Athi susa lamajoni biggie biggie mama from east to west
