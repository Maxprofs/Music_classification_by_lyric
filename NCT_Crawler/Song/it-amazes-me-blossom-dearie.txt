Blues/Jazz|

                        My height, just average
 My weight, just average
 And my IQ is like you'd estimate, just average
 But evidently he does not agree Consequently if I seem at sea
 It amazes me, it simply amazes me
 What he sees in me dazzles me
 Dazes me That I've learned to clip my wings
 And soften my ways
 These are ordinary things unworthy of praise
 Yet he praises my Just knowing I try for him
 When so many would
 If they could, die for him
 I'm the one who's worldly wise And nothing much fazes me
 But to see me in his eyes
 It just amazes me I'm the one who's worldly wise
 And nothing much fazes me
 But to see me in his eyes
 It just amazes me
