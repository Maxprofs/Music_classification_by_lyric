                        Bài hát : Thinking About You - Hardwell, Jay Sean

[Jay Sean:]
I wake up smiling every morning
Yeah, I don't mind sleeping alone
People ask me if I don't miss you
But I ain't been thinking about

All the nights we've spent together
And how your skin felt on my skin
And I'm just calling to let you know
Uuuh, I ain't been thinking about you

Been thinking about you
Been thinking about, thinking about, thinking about
I ain't been thinking about you
Been thinking about you
Been thinking about, thinking about
I ain't been thinking about you

I go out every single evening
I drink a little bit too much
People ask me if I don't miss you
But I ain't been thinking about

Nights when we went out together
When it was us against the world
No, I'm just calling to let you know that
Uuuh, I ain't been thinking about you

Been thinking about you
Been thinking about, thinking about, thinking about
I ain't been thinking about you
Been thinking about you
Been thinking about, thinking about
I ain't been thinking about you

[Hardwell (Jay Sean):]
I ain't been thinking about you
I ain't been thinking about you

[Jay Sean:]
No, I'm just calling to let you know that
Uuuh, I ain't been thinking about you

Been thinking about you
Been thinking about, thinking about, thinking about
I ain't been thinking about you
Been thinking about you
Been thinking about, thinking about
I ain't been thinking about you

I ain't been thinking about you
                        
                    |
