                        Now I’m not afraid to do the lord's work,
You say vengeance is his, but imma do it first.
I’m gonna handle my business in the name of the law.

Now if he made you cry, oh, I gotta know,
If he’s not ready to die, he best prepare for it.
My judgement’s divine, I tell you who you can call,
You can call.

You better call the police, call the coroner,
Call up your priest, have it for you.
Walk in no peace when I find that fool
Who did that to you, yeah,
Who did that to you, my baby,
Who did that to you,
Gotta find that fool who did that to you.

Now I don’t take pleasure in the man’s pain,
But my wrath will come down like the cold rain.
And there won’t be no shelter, no place you can go.
So put your hands up, time for surrender,
I’m a vigilante, my law’s defender,
You’re a wanted man, here everybody knows.

You better call the police, call the coroner,
Call up your priest, have it for you.
Walk in no peace when I find that fool
Who did that to you, yeah,
Who did that to you, my baby,
Who did that to you,
Gotta find that fool who did that to you.

Now he’ll keep on running, but I’m closing near,
I'll hunt him down until the bitter end,
If you see me coming near then, who you gonna call?

You better call the police, call the coroner,
Call up your priest, have it for you.
Walk in no peace when I find that fool
You better call the doctor, call the lawyer,
I chase ‘em all away to california,
Get my best trying to find that fool
Who did that to you
