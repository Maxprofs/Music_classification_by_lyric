                        [ti:]Finally
[ar:]Fergie
[al:]The Dutchess
Ever since I was a baby girl I had a dream
Cinderella theme
Crazy as it seems
Always knew that deep inside that there would come that day
When I would have to way
make so many mistakes
I could'nt comprehend
as I watched it unfold
This classic story told I left it in the cold
Walking through an open door that led me back to you
Each one unlocking more of the truth
I finally stopped tripping on my youth
I finally got lost inside of you
I finally know I needed to grow
And finally my maze had been solved
Finally
Now my destiny can begin
Though it will have a differences
Something strange and new is happening
Finally
Now my life doesn't seem so bad
Its the best that I've ever had
Give my love to him finally
I remember the beggining you already knew
I acted like a fool
Just trying to be cool
Fronting like it didn't matter
I just ran away
On another face
Was lost in my own space
Found what its like to hurt selfishly
scared to give of me
Afraid to just believe
I was in a jealous, insecure, pathetic place
Stumbled through the nets that I have made
Finally got out of my own way
I've Finally started living for today
I finally know I needed to grow
And finally my maze had been solved

Finally
Now my destiny can begin
Though we will have a differences
Something strange and new is happening
Finally
Now my life doesn't seem so bad
Its the best that I've ever had
Gave my love to him Finally
Finally, Finally
Finally
Now my destiny can begin
Though it will have a differences
Something beautiful is happening, happening
Finally
Now my life doesn't seem so bad
It's the best that I've ever had
Give my love to him finally
ohhhhhhh, Finally, Finally, finally
