                        At first I
 Was speechless
 At first I crumbled every time you smile
 You're right here
 Beside me
 You're right here saying you'd like to stay awhile
 All the people say we'll never
 be the type to stay together
 But you know I promise you
 we're gonna prove them wrong Maybe this is wrong
 Or maybe
 You're the one for me
 You're the one for me
 This feels a lot like love
 Leila, Leila, Leila
 You're the one for me December
 Snow fallin'
 But every word you whisper keeps me warm
 All the odds are stacked against us
 People say it's just a crush but
 If I could, you know that I'd stay here my whole life long Maybe this is wrong
 Or maybe
 You're the one for me
 You're the one for me
 This feels a lot like love
 Leila, Leila, Leila
 You're the one for me Maybe I'll get hurt
 and I should keep my distance
 Be careful with my heart
 But I don't to listen
 Here with you tonight
 Something in me knows this can be wrong Maybe
 You're the one for me
 You're the one for me
 This feels a lot like love
 Leila, Leila, Leila
 You're the one for me
 Whoa
 The one for me
