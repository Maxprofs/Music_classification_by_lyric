                        If you ain't got no wings
 And if you ain't the king
 And you can't make it rain
 Hell no, you can't feel my pain If you ain't got no chains
 If you ain't got a cage
 And you can't calm the rage
 You ain't changin' anything Chorus:
 Already made the news
 Slipped out of every noose
 I've cut my demons loose
 Get out of my face, I don't need you to save me
 Raged on fumes
 There's nothing left to use
 My middle name's abuse
 Get out of my face, I don't need you to save me I you can't part the sea
 And you can't pardon me
 If you don't like what you see
 You don't know how to save my soul Cause I've been in the trenches
 Fighting off the devil's wenches
 I've had all the scars and stitches
 To make you see, make you see
 Get the *** away from me Chorus:
 Already made the news
 Slipped out of every noose
 I've cut my demons loose
 Get out of my face, I don't need you to save me
 Raged on fumes
 There's nothing left to use
 My middle name's abuse
 Get out of my face, I don't need you to save me If you take a look in my eyes, you'll see in my eyes
 A whole world full of hurt, addiction, and lies
 I've been through it before, but somehow I survived
 Now I'm flirting with death, but never been more alive Chorus:
 Already made the news
 Slipped out of every noose
 I've cut my demons loose
 Get out of my face, I don't need you to save me
 Raged on fumes
 There's nothing left to use
 My middle name's abuse
 Get out of my face, I don't need you to save me Get out of my face
 I don't need you to save me
