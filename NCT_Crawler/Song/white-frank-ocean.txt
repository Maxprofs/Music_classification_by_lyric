                        could this be earth, could this be light
 does this mean everythings going to be alright
 one look out my window theres trees talking like people
 i dreamt of storms, i dreamt of sound
 i dreamt of gravity keeping us around
 i slept in the darkness it was lonely and it was silent
 what is this love, i dont feel the same
 dont believe what this is, could be given a name
 i awoke you there chasing planets on my forehead
 but i forget 23 like i forget 17
 and i forget my first love, like you forget a day dream
 and what of all my wild friends, and the times i've had with them
 but i'll fade to grey soon on the tv station
