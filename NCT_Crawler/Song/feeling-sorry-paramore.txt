Paramore - Feeling Sorry

We still live in the same town
Well, don't we?
But I don't see you around anymore
I go to all the same places
Not even a trace of you
Your days are numbered at twenty-four

And I'm getting bored, waiting around for you
We're not getting any younger
And I won't look back, 'cause there's no use
It's time to move forward

I feel no sympathy
You live inside a cage
You barely get by
The rest of us are trying
There's no need to apologize
I've got no time for feeling sorry

But I try not to think of what might happen
When your reality, it finally cuts through
Well, as for me, I got out and I'm on the road
The worst part is that this, this could be you

And you know it, too
You can't run from your shame
You're not getting any younger
Time keeps passing by
But you waited away
It's time to roll over

I feel no sympathy
You live inside a cage
You barely get by
The rest of us are trying
There's no need to apologize
I've got no time for feeling sorry

And all the best lies
They are told with fingers tight
So cross them tight
Won't you promise me tonight
If it's the last thing you do, you'll get out?

I feel no sympathy
You live inside a cage
You barely get by
The rest of us are trying
There's no need to apologize
Got no time
Got no time

I feel no sympathy
You live inside a cage
You barely get by
The rest of us are trying
There's no need to apologize
Got no time
I've got no time for feeling sorry
I've got no time for feeling sorry
