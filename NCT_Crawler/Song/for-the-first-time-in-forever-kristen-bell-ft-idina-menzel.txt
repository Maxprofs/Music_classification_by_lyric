                        Bài hát : For The First Time In Forever - Kristen Bell, Idina Menzel

Anna: 
The window is open, so’s that door 
I didn’t know they did that anymore 
Who knew we owned a thousand salad plates? 
For years I’ve roamed these empty halls 
Why have a ballroom with no balls? 
Finally they’re opening up the gates 

There’ll be actual real live people 
It’ll be totally strange 
Wow, am I so ready for this change 

'Cuz for the first time in forever 
There’ll be music, there’ll be light 
For the first time in forever 
I’ll be dancing through the night 

Don’t know if I’m elated or gassy 
But I’m somewhere in the zone 
'Cuz for the first time in forever 
I won’t be alone 

Anna: I can’t wait to meet everyone! (gasp) What if I meet.. the one? 

Tonight imagine me gown and all, fetchingly draped against the wall 
A picture of sophisticated grace 
I suddenly see him standing there, a beautiful stranger, tall and fair 
I wanna stuff some chocolate in my face 

But then we laugh and talk all evening, 
Which is totally bizarre 
Nothing like the life I’ve lead so far 

For the first time in forever 
There’ll be magic, there’ll be fun 
For the first time in forever 
I could be noticed by someone 

And I know it’s totally crazy 
To dream I’d find romance 
But for the first time in forever 
At least I’ve got a chance 

Elsa: 
Don’t let them in, don’t let them see 
Be the good girl you always have to be 
Conceal, don’t feel, put on a show 
Make one wrong move and everyone will know 

Elsa (Anna): 
But it’s only for today (It’s only for today) 
This agony awaits (This agony awaits) 
Tell the guards to open up the gates (The gates) 

Anna (Elsa): 
For the first time in forever (Don’t let them in, don’t let them see) 
I’m getting what I’m dreaming of (Be the good girl you always have to be) 
A chance to change my lonely world (Conceal) 
A chance to find true love (Conceal, don’t feel, don’t let them know) 

Anna: 
I know it all ends tomorrow, 
So it has to be today 
'Cuz for the first time in forever 
For the first time in forever 
Nothing’s in my way!
                        
                    |
