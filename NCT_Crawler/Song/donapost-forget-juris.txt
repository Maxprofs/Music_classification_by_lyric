                        Don't Forget
Juris


It’s the end now, we must say goodbye
In two places under the same sky
But the distance won’t mean anything at all
Don’t forget me 'coz I still love you

I will recall the times that you and I have shared
Our laughter rings so loudly in the wind
Your eyes reflects my own, both are shedding tears
We’re swimming but drowning in this lonely sea

Holding tight, don’t want to let go
Saving every breath for the last...

It’s the end now, we must say goodbye
In two places under the same sky
But the distance won’t mean anything at all
Don’t forget me 'coz I still love you

Holding tight, don’t want to let go
Saving every breath for the last...

It’s the end now, we must say goodbye
In two places under the same sky
But the distance won’t mean anything at all
Don’t forget me ‘cause I still love you

Even if we’ll be apart
I will keep the fires burning
You’ll come back to me someday

It’s the end now, we must say goodbye
In two places under the same sky
But the distance won’t mean anything at all
Don’t forget me 'coz I still love you

In my own heart, I won’t say goodbye
All our love will light up the whole sky
Far away but always in my heart you’ll be
Don’t forget me 'coz I still love you

Don’t forget me please come back someday
                        
                    |
