                        Bài hát: No Love - August Alsina

[Intro — Nicki Minaj:]
(Drumma Boy)
August
Young Money
I swear this is my favorite song [laughs]
I'm serious

[Verse 1 — August Alsina:]
Red light
You know I can't make this thing that official
Believe we had a great night but I ain't the type to tell you that I miss you ***
You don't like that I make this easy, leaving
After sexing on the floor
Baby, I know you need me, like I need you
But I'm not the one you wanna love

[Hook — August Alsina:]
So just pop a couple bands with a nigga like me
Loving ain't the same with a nigga like me
You use to them but ain't no loving me
I hear what you would say and, girl, it's clear to see
You should just drink a couple drinks with a nigga like me
You probably go insane with a nigga like me
Let's just party till we can't, ain't no loving me
And I'm the one to blame, ain't no loving me
So don't come looking for love
Oh, no love [9x]
(Don't come looking for love)
Oh, no love [9x]

[Verse 2 — August Alsina:]
Shawty, if you looking for somebody tryna settle down
Probably won't be around, nah, baby
You should hit me when you tired of playing up in the house
And ain't nobody around
You need that
When you need that late night
We can both make love to the daylight
You got it, girl, you got it, girl
But you know I can't stay right? Uh nah babe
All I want is you so what you tryna do?

[Hook]

[Refrain — August Alsina:]
No love, no love, no love [6x]

[Bridge — Nicki Minaj:]
August you know, I'm here to save you
Me and them girls, we ain't the same, boo
You know I hate it, when you leave me
'Cause you love it then you leave it
But you know how bad I need it
You're so fuckin' conceited
Why you coming over weeded

[Verse 3 — Nicki Minaj (August Alsina):]
You can't treat me like you treat them
Yes, I am the crème de la crème
Yes I am from one to ten, ten
You fronting in them streets, keep saying we just friends
You can't front like this ain't way realer
I know you hard, I know that you a killer
I know you started off a dope dealer
But let your guard down, your niggas know you feel her, feel her
So what you want, baby?
(All I want is you)
(So what you trying to do?)

[Hook]
