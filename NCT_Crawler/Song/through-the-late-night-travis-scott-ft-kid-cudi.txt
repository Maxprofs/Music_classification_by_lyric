Day 'n' nite (yeah!), I toss and turn
I keep stress in my mind, mind
I seek the peace, sometimes I can't restrain
To join a rage at night, come out and play, play
Mhmm, balance (yeah!), find your balance
God said it's my talent
Sprinkle a little season on the salad
Relieve my heart of malice (yeah!), hit my palace (straight up!)
Stroke my cactus (it's lit!), oh, don't wait (yeah!)
Mhm don't play (yah, yeah!)
Play no games like the NBA (brr)
Throwin' checks like the NBA (brr)
You a ring, you a ring
We shootin' shots like the NRA
Ahh, she jammin' Travis and Kid Cudi (straight up!)
The new Krayzie Bone and Slim Bun B
Shawty, on the scene, pull up on the scene
Sip my tea, lean no Hennessy
Aw save all, take it right (yah!)
Aw take it all, never light (straight up!)
Aw, had a ball, had a night
Aw, after all, sleep good
