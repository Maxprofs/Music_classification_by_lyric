                        Bài hát : Beautiful Girl - Sarah Mclachlan

One thing that I know
it will get better
each and every drought
ends in the river

if I were a diviner, you’d be awash in rain to cool your fire
oh to cool your fire

There could be winds of change in my auburn hair
but I’ll tie it back for now
and when the bitter breeze carries a trace of fear
we’ll persevere some how

we’re gonna push on through, pretty girl
just like we always do, beautiful girl
I know the world can be cruel, pretty girl
you’re gonna make it ’cause you’ve got love on your side

the truth of letting go
lies in the answer
that when the storm subsides
I’ll still be there to hold you

there’s beauty in your violence, and the dissonant melody i hear you sing
oh I love to hear you sing

there could be winds of change in my auburn hair
but I’ll tie it back for now
and when the bitter breeze carries a trace of fear
we’ll persevere somehow

we’re gonna push on through, pretty girl
just like we always do, beautiful girl
I know the world can be cruel, pretty girl
you’re gonna make it ’cause you got love on your side

pretty girl

one thing that I know
is it will get better...
