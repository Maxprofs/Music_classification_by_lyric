                        Bài hát: I'm Just Sayin' - Karmin

Oh if I want it, Im gonna get it
 And Im just sayin, Im just sayin
 Oh if I want it, Im gonna get it
 And Im just sayin, Im just sayin
 Future in my hands, gotta make it count
 Convince yourself its feasible and then its something else
 Sick addiction dangerous mind,
 Put it on command, era undefined
 Even when you got a shadow of doubt
 Even when a hundred people tell you its a wipe out
 You gotta do it big, you gotta do it strong
 At the end of the day
 Youre the one whos in the wrong
 Regretting and forgetting everything you work for
 Instead of trendsetting and betting and its so upsetting and Im sweating now
 And I cant believe it, it should be so easy oh
 Already got a knack just dial it back
 The windows open and world is yours, go attack
 Cause when the wind is right, and the tide is high, then its time to fly
 Oh if I want it, Im gonna get it
 And Im just sayin, Im just sayin
 Oh if I want it, Im gonna get it
 And Im just sayin, Im just sayin
 I know, know, know where to go go go
 Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,
 I know, know, know where to go go go
 Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,
 Did you ever think, Ill do what I want
 Me and the marathon, ha, one in the front
 Now youre making plans, dont let them screw it up
 Better write your name on it, paper cup
 Most people afraid of here and no, got a boo got stage once apollo
 I can do anything that I wanna do
 And Ill take that cause its not for you
 Take a few years to surface, but now its so berserk
 Yes and Im ring lead in this circus
 I'm just sayin' I'm just laying in the pave the road ahead of me
 Breaking the elements
 Watching they cave in, my heart is racing
 And palpitating, i'm so done anticipating
 Its all good though, made up my mind
 Threading the needle is the part of the design
 Oh if I want it, Im gonna get it
 And Im just sayin, Im just sayin
 Oh if I want it, Im gonna get it
 And Im just sayin, Im just sayin
 I know, know, know where to go go go
 Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,
 I know, know, know where to go go go
 Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,
 If I want it know, Im gonna get it
 Im just sayin thats the way that it goes
 Whoa, if I want it know, Im gonna get it
 Im just sayin thats the way that it goes
 And if you make it life, Ima tell you what
 You only get one, would you be anonymous huh
 Let them take a note, reenact them at the plane
 Approaching destination, hit the main lane
 Now we glidin, windin, trying not to crash
 Cause we so high gotta keep grinding
 Not a limit we driving in this ship we running it all
 Oh if I want it, Im gonna get it
 And Im just sayin, Im just sayin
 Oh if I want it, Im gonna get it
 And Im just sayin, Im just sayin
 I know, know, know where to go go go
 Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
 I know, know, know where to go go go
 Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
