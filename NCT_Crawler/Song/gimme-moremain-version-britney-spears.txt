                        (Feat Danja)

 (It's Britney, bitch)
 (I see you, and I just wanna dance with you)

 Everytime they turn the lights down
 Just wanna go that extra mile for you
 Public display of affection
 Feel's like no one else in the room (But You)

 We can get down like there's no one around
 We keep on rockin' (We keep on rockin')
 We keep on rockin' (Keep on rockin')

 Cameras are flashing while we're dirty dancing
 They keep watchin' (They keep watchin')
 Keep watchin
 Feels like the crowd is saying

 [Chorus:]
 Gimme gimme more
 Gimme more
 Gimme gimme more
 Gimme gimme more
 Gimme (Mo')
 Gimme gimme more
 Gimme gimme more
 Gimme more
 Gimme gimme more
 Gimme gimme more
 Gimme (Mo')
 Gimme gimme more

 Center of attention ('tention)
 Even when they're up against the wall
 You got me in a crazy position (Yeah)
 If you're on a mission (Uh-huh)
 You got my permission (Oh)

 We can get down like there's no one around
 We'll keep on rockin' (Keep on rockin')
 We'll keep on rockin', rockin' (Uh-uh)

 Cameras are flashing while we're dirty dancing
 They keep watchin' (Wait)
 Keep watchin
 (Feel's like the crowd is saying)

 [Chorus:]
 Gimme gimme more
 Gimme more
 Gimme gimme more
 Gimme gimme more

 Gimme (Mo')
 Gimme gimme more
 Gimme gimme more
 Gimme more
 Gimme gimme more
 Gimme gimme more
 Gimme (Mo')
 Gimme gimme more

 (I just can't control myself, oh)
 (They want more? Well I'll give'em more, oh!)

 [Chorus:]
 Gimme gimme more
 Gimme more
 Gimme gimme more (Gimme more)
 Gimme gimme more
 Gimme (Mo')
 Gimme gimme more (Ooh)
 Gimme gimme more
 Gimme more
 Gimme gimme more
 Gimme gimme more (Gimme more, oh yeah)
 Gimme (Mo')
 Gimme gimme more

 Ohh, gimme more, gimme more (More)
 Gimme more, gimme more baby
 I just wanna more

 [Chorus:]
 Gimme gimme
 Gimme
 Gimme gimme more
 Gimme gimme
 Gimme (Ooh)
 Gimme gimme more
 Gimme gimme
 Gimme
 Gimme gimme more
 Gimme gimme
 Gimme (Ooh)
 Gimme gimme

 Bet you didn't see this one coming
 The incredible Lygo
 The lengendary Miss Britney Spears, haha
 And the unstoppable Danja
 Ahh, you gonna have to remove me
 Cause I ain't goin' no where, haha
