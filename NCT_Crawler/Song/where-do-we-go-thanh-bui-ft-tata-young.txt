                        Song: Where Do We Go
Singer: Thanh Bùi, Tata Young

It’s keeping me up at night. It's unfamiliar ground.
Feels just like we're falling, feels like we're breaking down.
We going through the rough, I'm scared you're gonna leave.
We’re not even talking. but right now I'm gonna speak.

No more hiding, Break the silence now.
Do we quit or try to work things out?

Where do we go (Where do we go from here) 
Are we ready to just give it up
Should we turn our back on love or should we stand within?
I don't wanna let it go
But it can't be just me that fight for it.
Let's take good chance on love.
We can't go on like this.

Where do we go (Where do we)
Where do we go (Where do we).
Where do we go (Tell me).
Where do we go from here

If we begin at where we are, try to mend our problems now 
We'll be looking forward instead of looking back 
I don't wanna play it safe 'cos I wanna cross the line
Feels just like we're standing, we're running out of time
No more hiding, Break the silence now
Do we quit or try to work things out (Do we work it out)  

No more hiding, Break the silent now 
Beat night and we can work this out 
Where do we go from here?(Where do we go from here) 
Are we ready to just give it up? 
Should we turn our back on love or should we stand within? 
I don't wanna let it go but i can just speak that fight for it 
Let's see good chance on love, i can't go on like this 

Where do we go (Where do we) 
Where do we go (Where do we) 
Where do we go (Tell me) 
Where do we go from here.
