                        I was with my friends, third street walking the promenade
 Then you pass by like a shooting star
 I started falling, for you
 Without a warning.
 In my dreams Im asking your name, put your number down
 Then I wake up and I chickened out.
 This part I hated,
 Young Love, so complicated.
 I know what people say, dont get carried away
 They say boy you got your whole life ahead of you,
 but what am I supposed to do?
 Young love is taking me over, your love
 Im losing control, my heart stops, stops when I get close to you,
 Like lightning striking out of the blue.
 Young love stealing my sleep but so what,
 If youre feeling me put your hands up, hands up
 All around the world everybody in Young Love, Young Love
 Since that day, Ive been walking the avenues, hoping I would bump into you, or you into me.
 But nothing, just cold empty streets
 I never thought I would see your face again.
 Just like that I saw you walking in, the doors of my show.
 Sat down in the front row.
 I know what people say, dont get carried away (oh no)
 Say boy you got your whole life ahead of you, but what am I supposed to do?
 Young love, is taking me over your love,
 Im losing control
 My heart stop stops
 When I get close to you
 Like lightning striking out of the blue
 Young love, Its still in my sleep,
 But so what, If youre feeling me
 Put your hands up, hands up,
 All around the world,
 Everybody in young love.
 Young Love
 I know what people say, dont get carried away
 They say boy you got your whole life ahead of you, but what am I supposed to do?
 Young love, is taking me over your love,
 Im losing control
 My heart stop stops
 When I get close to you
 Like lightning striking out of the blue
 Young love, Its still in my sleep,
 But so what, If youre feeling me
 Put your hands up, hands up,
 All around the world,
 Everybody in young love.
 Young Love
 Ah yeah
 I was with my friends
 Third street walking the promenade
 Then you pass by like a shooting star
 I started falling, for you
 Without a warning.
