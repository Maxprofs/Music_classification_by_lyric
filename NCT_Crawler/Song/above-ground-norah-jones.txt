                        [ti:Above Ground]
[ar:Norah Jones]
[al:Feels Like Home]
[offset:500]
Underground I'm waiting
Just below the crowded avenue
Watching red lights fading out of you

Oh the air feels heavy
Everything just passes by
And I think that I'm a little shy

Meet me outside above ground
I'll see you on your way
I'll be with you someday, someday

Drawing lines above my head
But the fan keeps spinning over me
Just my toughs to keep me company

Now I know I'm ready
For the night into a glass
And I sip it slow to make it last

Meet me outside above ground
I'll see you on your way
I'll be with you someday, someday

Meet me outside above ground
I'll see you on your way
I'll be with you someday
I'll be with you someday
I'll be with you someday
I'll be with you someday
