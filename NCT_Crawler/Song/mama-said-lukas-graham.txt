                        Bài hát: Mama Said - Lukas Graham

When mama said that it was okay
Mama said that it was quite alright
Our kind of people had a bed for the night
And it was okay
Mama told us that we were good kids
And daddy told us never listen to the ones
Pointing nasty fingers and making fun
'Cause we were good kids

Remember asking both my mom and dad
Why we never travelled to exotic lands
We only ever really visit' friends
Nothing to tell when the summer ends
We never really went buying clothes
Folks were passing the stuff in plenty loads
New shoes once a year and then
Out to play ball so we could ruin them

When mama said that is was okay
Mama said that it was quite alright
Our kind of people had a bed for the night
And it was okay
Mama told us we were good kids
And daddy told us never listen to the ones
Pointing nasty fingers and making fun
'Cause we were good kids

Don't get me wrong I didn't have it bad
I got enough lovin' from my mom and dad
But I don't think they really understood
When I said that I wanted to deal in Hollywood
I told I might be singing on TV
The other kids were calling me a wannabe
The older kids they started bugging me

But now they're all standing right in front of me (ha ha)
Mama said that is was okay
Mama said that it was quite alright
Our kind of people had a bed for the night
And it was okay
Mama told us we were good kids
And daddy told us never listen to the ones
Pointing nasty fingers and making fun

'Cause we were good kids
I know which place I'm from
I know my home
When I'm in doubt and struggling
That's where I'll go
And old friend can give advice
When new friends only know the half story
That's why I always keep them tight
And why I'm okay
I said I'm okay
You know what my mama said?

You know what she told me?
Mama said that it was okay
Mama said that it was quite alright
Our kind of people had a bed for the night
And it was okay
Mama told us that we were good kids
And daddy told us never listen to the ones
Pointing nasty fingers and making fun

'Cause we were good kids
My mama said that it was okay
Babada baba
Babada baba
Babada baba
My mama said that is was okay
Babada baba
Babada baba
Babada baba
My mama said that it was okay
