                        Hello Mr. Mosley
 Im glad youre my maker
 My Loyalty lies in your hands, youre my breath taker
 Your body, your kiss is in unknown demand
 So take command, go Timbo I be the same when it all goes up
 I be the same when it all goes down
 Not the first one, open it up
 I be the last one closin it out
 Dont know if Ill give you a shot yet
 Lil Mama Im peepin your style
 Do I think youre dope enough, yup
 One way of findin it out
 The way you came at me, boo
 Dont care, not afraid Im like Wild
 Really want it from head to toe
 Question if she gon let it out
 Anyway the hour glass go
 I dont worry anyhow
 Why dont we see where it go
 Lets figure it out [Chorus]
 When the cats come out the bats come out to playy Yeahh
 In the morning after
 The dawn is here, be gone be on your wayy Yeahh
 In the morning after
 When the cats come out the bats come out to playy Yeahh
 In the morning after
 The dawn is here, be gone be on your wayy Yeahh
 In the morning after Dark Owww, Oooohhh Owww Come on SoShy [SoShy]
 I got a little secret for ya
 I never sleep when comes the night
 But everytime I smack my fingers
 I switch back into the light
 My moon belong to your sun
 Your fire is burning my mind
 Is it love or is it lust
 Something that I just cant describe (ah)
 Am I the one and only (ah)
 Cause youre the only one (ah)
 It felt so long and lonely (ah)
 Waiting for you to come
 Its lookin bright and early
 Im willing to close my eyes
 This is the unusual story
 Timbo and SoShy [Chorus]
 When the cats come out the bats come out to playy Yeahh
 In the morning after
 The dawn is here, be gone be on your wayy Yeahh
 In the morning after
 When the cats come out the bats come out to playy Yeahh
 In the morning after
 The dawn is here, be gone be on your wayy Yeahh
 In the morning after Dark Heyy, Heyy, (ay) Heyy, Timbo! You talk about takin it slow
 Im talkin about takin it Wild
 Dont wanna be too up front no
 Baby you know its my style
 Im talkin about lightin it up
 You talkin about dimmin it down
 Dont think about lettin it go
 But Ive never seen no king that bows
 Yes Im the one and only
 You know I see right through ya
 I get it your magnetic
 So you draw me right to ya
 Maybe I give you a shot yup
 Maybe you deserve the crown
 Wont give you a treasure map yet
 Cause youll figure it out [Chorus]
 When the cats come out the bats come out to playy Yeahh
 In the morning after
 The dawn is here, be gone be on your wayy Yeahh
 In the morning after
 When the cats come out the bats come out to playy Yeahh
 In the morning after
 The dawn is here, be gone be on your wayy Yeahh
 In the morning after Dark Dark dark dark dark dark
 In the morning after dark
 Dark dark dark dark dark
 In the morning after dark
 Please dont leave me girl
 In the morning after dark
 Please dont leave me girl (Please dont leave me girl) When the cats come out the bats come out to playy
 When the cats come out the bats come out to playy
 Play play
 The dawn is here be on your way

 Play play play
 The dawn is here be on your way (way way way way)
