                        Bài hát: O Holy Night - Carola, Paul Potts

O holy night, the stars are brightly shining
It is the night of our dear Savior's birth
Long lay the world in sin and error pining
Till He appeared and the soul felt its worth

A thrill of hope, the weary world rejoices
For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn
Fall on your knees, oh, hear the angel voices
Oh night divine, oh night when Christ was born
Oh night divine, oh night, oh night divine

O holy night, the stars are brightly shining
It is the night of our dear Savior's birth
Sweet hymns of joy in grateful chorus raise we
With all within hearts praise His holy name
Christ is the Lord then ever, forever praise we
Noel, Noel, oh night, oh night divine
Oh night divine, oh night, O holy night
