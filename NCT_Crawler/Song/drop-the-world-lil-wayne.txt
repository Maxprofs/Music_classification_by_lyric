Lil' Wayne Ft. Eminem - Drop The World

(Lil Wayne)
I got ice in my veins
Blood in my eye
Hate in my heart
Love in my mind
I seen nights full of pain
Days of the same
You keep the sunshine
Save me the rain
I search but never find
Hurt but never cry
I work and forever try
But im cursed so never mine
And its worse but better times
Seems further and beyond
The top gets higher the more that I climb
The spot gets smaller and I get bigger
Trying to get in where I fit in
No room for a n-gga but soon for a n-gga it be on mutherf-cker cause
All this bullsh-t have made me strong, mutherf-cker

(Chorus)
So I pick the world up and im a drop it on your f-ckin head
Yeah, bitch ima pick the World up and I'ma drop it on your f-ckin head
Yeah, and I can die now rebirth mutherf-cker
Hop up in my spaceship and leave earth motherfucker
I'm gone, mutherf-cker, I'm gone

(Lil Wayne)
I know what they dont wanna tell you
Just hope your heaven sent and ya hell proof
I'll wake up in the World and cut the lights off
And confidence is a stain they cant wipe off
Uh, my word is my pride
But wisdom is bleak and thats word from the wise
Served to survive, murder and bribe
And when it got too heavy i put my burden aside..

(Chorus)
So I pick the world up and im a drop it on your f-ckin head
Yeah, bitch ima pick the World up and I'ma drop it on your f-ckin head
Yeah, and I can die now rebirth mutherf-cker
Hop up in my spaceship and leave earth motherfucker
I'm gone, mutherf-cker, I'm gone

(Eminem)
It hurts but never show
It's pain youll never know
If only you can see just how lonely and how cold
And frostbit i've become
My back's against the wall
When push come to shove
I just stand up and scream f-ck em all

Man it feels like these walls are closing in, this roof is caving in,
Oop its time to raise it then
Your days are numbered like pages and my vocal rhymes got em cookem boy
This crooked mind of mine got em all shook and scared to look in my eyes,
I stole that f-ckin clock, i took the time and i came up from behind
And pretty much snuck up and butt f-cked this game up
Better be careful when you bring my name up f-ck this fame
That aint what i came to claim, but the game aint gonna be the same
On the day that i leave it
But I swear one way or another im gonna make these f-ckin haters believe us
I swear to God, won't spare the rod, im a man of my word
So your f-ckin heads better nod
Im gonna f-ck around in this pitch and roast everybody
Sleep on me that pillar is where yo head will lie permanetly bitch its betty bye
This world is my easter egg getting prepared to die
My head is swoll
My confidence is up
This stage is my pedestal
Im unstoppable the incredible hulk
Your trapped in my medicine ball
I can run circles around you so fast your f-ckin head will spin dog,
Ill split your cabbage and your lettuce and i'll f-ckin

(Chorus)
So I pick the world up and im a drop it on your f-ckin head
Yeah, bitch ima pick the World up and I'ma drop it on your f-ckin head
Yeah, and I can die no rebirth now mutherf-cker
Hop up in my spaceship and leave earth motherfucker
I'm gone, mutherf-cker, I'm gone
