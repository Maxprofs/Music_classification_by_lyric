                        Taxi driver
 You're my shrink for the hour
 Leave the meter running
 It's rush hour
 So take the streets if you wanna
 Just outrun the demons, could you?
 He said allahu Akbar, I told him don't curse me
 But boy you need prayer, I guess it couldn't hurt me
 If it brings me to my knees
 It's a bad religion This unrequited love
 To me it's nothing but
 A one-man cult
 And cyanide in my Styrofoam cup
 I could never make him love me
 Never make him love me
 Love me
 Love me Taxi driver
 I swear I've got three lives
 Balanced on my head like steak knives
 I can't tell you the truth about my disguise
 I can't trust no one
 And you say allahu Akbar, I told him don't curse me
 But boy you need prayer, I guess it couldn't hurt me
 If it brings me to my knees
 It's a bad religion This unrequited love
 To me it's nothing but
 A one-man cult
 And cyanide in my Styrofoam cup
 I could never make him love me
 Never make him love me It's a bad religion
 To be in love with someone
 Who could never love you
 Only bad, only bad religion
 Could have me feeling the way I do
