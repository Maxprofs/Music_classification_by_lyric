                        Britney im sorry for the lies we told 
we took you into our arms and then left you cold 
britney im sorry for this cruel cruel world 
we sell the beauty but destroy the girl 
britney im sorry for your broken heart 
we stood aside and watched you fall apart 
im sorry we told you fame would fill you up 
and money moves the man so drink the cup 

i know love goes around the world we know 
and you never see it coming back 
you never see it coming back 
i know love goes around the world we know 
and you never see it coming back 
but i can see it coming back for you 
yes coming back for you 

britney im sorry for the stones we throw 
we tear you down just so we can watch the show 
britney im sorry for the words we say 
we point the finger as you fall from grace 

i know love goes around the world we know 
and you never see it coming back 
you never see it coming back 
and i know love goes around the world we know 
and you never see it coming back 
but i can see it coming back for you 

yeah, its coming back for you, yeah, its coming back for you, yeah, its coming back for you, yeah 

britney i do believe that love has come 
here for the broken 
here for the ones like us 

i know love goes around the world we know 
and you never see it coming back 
you never see it coming back 
and i know love goes around the world we know 
and you never see it coming back 
but i can see it coming back 

i know love goes around the world we know 
and you never see it coming back 
you never see it coming back 
i can see it coming back for you 

its coming back for you... yeah
