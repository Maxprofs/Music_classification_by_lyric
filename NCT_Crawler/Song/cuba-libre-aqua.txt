                        Na, na, na Her eyes were oceans of freedom, my mind strong like a kingdom
 Nothing in this world could break our hearts
 I close my eyes and believe in, one day we'll meet when we're dreaming
 That's the only place where we can hide Climbing the hill's like a lion, we will never give up trying
 No one could have forced our love apart Libre love, libre us
 Take me to the place where we can be Cuba libre be my love tonight
 She was running down the street of solitude
 Cuba libre be my love tonight
 A lonely rose was bleeding from the root
 And they sang, na, na, na I close my eyes and believe in
 One day we'll meet when were dreaming
 That's the only place where we can hide
 The music we made together, will always be there forever
 Goodbye my love sleep tight tonight Libre love, libre us
 Take me to the place where we can be Cuba libre be my love tonight
 She was running down the street of solitude
 Cuba libre be my love tonight
 A lonely rose was bleeding from the root
 And they sang, na, na, na Libre love, libre us
 Take me to the place where we can be Cuba libre be my love tonight
 She was running down the streets of solitude
 And they sang
 Cuba libre be my love tonight
 A lonely rose was bleeding from the root
 And they sang, na, na, na
                        
                    |
