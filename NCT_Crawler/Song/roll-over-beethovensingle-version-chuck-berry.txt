                        Well
 I'm, gonna write a little letter Gonna
 mail it to my local DJ Yeah
 an', it's a jumpin' little record I
 want my jockey to play Roll
 over Beethoven I; gotta hear it again today You

 know my, temperature's risin' The
 jukebox's blowin' a fuse My
 heart's beatin' rhythm And
 my soul keeps a-singin' the blues Roll
 Over Beethoven and tell Tchaikovsky the news I

 got the rockin' pneumonia I
 need a shot of rhythm and blues I
 caught the rollin' arthritis Sittin'
 down at a rhythm review Roll
 over Beethoven they're rockin' in two by two Well

 if, you feel it and like it Go
 get your lover then, reel and rock it Roll
 it over and then move on up just A
 trifle further and reel and rock with one another Roll
 over Beethoven dig, these rhythm and blues (Guitar

 Solo) Well

 early, in the mornin' I’m, a-givin' you a warnin' Don't
 you step on my blue suede shoes Hey
 diddle diddle I, am playin' my fiddle Ain't
 got nothin' to lose Roll
 over Beethoven and tell Tchaikovsky the news You

 know she wiggles like a glow worm Dance
 like a spinnin' top She
 got a crazy partner Ya
 oughta see 'em reel and rock Long
 as she got a dime the music won’t never stop Roll

 Over Beethoven Roll
 Over Beethoven Roll
 Over Beethoven Roll
 Over Beethoven Roll
 Over Beethoven Dig
 these rhythm and blues
