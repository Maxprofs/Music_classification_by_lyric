Leona Lewis - The Best You Never Had

I was so in love with you
There was nothing i could do
Wouldnt give me the time of day
Now you wanna be with me
You say you wanna be with me

You said i was the best
Gave your love out the rest
There was nothing i could say
Its going good for me
You say you wanna be with me .. Now

Yeh your telling me that
I am were its at
But i aint havin none of that....

Because i told you , you would look to regret it ,
Now i thought it would make it you feel bad,
But when it comes to me just forget it,
Ill be the best you never had,
You put me through so many emotions,
Now baby its besides the fact,
Cos in your empty heart i left a mark,
The best you never had.

No, No, No

Its only as a friend,
Baby i dont want revenge,
But if you must know the truth,
What you didnt see in me
Thats what u'll never be nooo,
When your telling me i was always the one,
I feel disareason.

Becuase i told you , you would look to regret it ,
Now i thought it would make it you feel bad,

But when it comes to me just forget it,
Ill be the best you never had,
You put me through so many emotions,
Now baby its besides the fact,
Cos in your empty heart i left a mark,
The best you never had.

That was... Good love....My stuff
Thats what you missed out on
My touch... show much we could have
You miss,
My kiss,
My lips,
The love i had for you
Also so long, baby dont it make you sad...

Because i told you , you would look to regret it ,
Now i thought it would make it you feel bad,
But when it comes to me just forget it,
Ill be the best you never had,
You put me through so many emotions,
Now baby its besides the fact,
Cos in your empty heart i left a mark,
The best you never had.

Because i told you , you would look to regret it ,
Now i thought it would make it you feel bad,
But when it comes to me just forget it,
Ill be the best you never had,
You put me through so many emotions,
Now baby its besides the fact,
Cos in your empty heart i left a mark,
The best you never had.

Well i will always be the best you never had

The best you never had
