Fergie, Ferg what's up baby?
Come on

When I come to the clubs step aside (o snap)
Pop the seats don't be hating me in the line (o snap)
V.I.P. cuz you know I gotta shine (o snap)
I'm Fergie Fergie and me love you long time (o snap)

All my girls get down on the floor (o snap)
Back to back drop it down real low (o snap)
I'm such a lady but I'm dancing like a (***,o snap)
Cuz you know what, I don't give a ***
So here we go (o snap)

How come every time you come around
My London London Bridge wanna down
Like London London wanna go down
Like London London be going down like...

How come every time you come around
My London London Bridge wanna down
Like London London wanna go down
Like London London be going down like...

Drinks start pouring
And my speech start slurring
Everybody start looking real good

The Grey Goose got the girl feeling loose
Now I wishing that I didn't wear these shoes (I hate heels)
It's like everytime I get up on the dude
Papparazzi put my business in the news
And I'm like get up out my face (o snap)

My lips make you wanna have a taste (o snap)
You got that? I got the bass

How come every time you come around
My London London Bridge wanna down
Like London London wanna go down
Like London London be going down like...

How come every time you come around
My London London Bridge wanna down
Like London London wanna go down
Like London London be going down like...

Ah da da da da da du du du du...
Me like a bullet type, you know they comin' right
Fergie love 'em long time, my girls support right
Ah da da da da da du du du du...
Me like a bullet type you know they comin' right
Fergie love 'em long time, my girls support right

Another A.T.O.
