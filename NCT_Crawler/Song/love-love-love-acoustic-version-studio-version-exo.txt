Translation 

Everyday, everyday, everyday I look for you. Just come back
After meeting you, I’ve started to circle around you like this
You won’t come back right? If you turn that handle
I’m curious of the world after going through that tightly shut door

The moment the door opens the world I knew and a different place spread
You’re opening You’re blossoming
Like this, like this, you’re quite warm
The place where my two feet touch, this everything all resembles you
I want to live here everyday, everyday
Let me live all day by your side

Reality doesn’t come. Why isn’t this a dream?
Even I don’t believe it. Is it right that you’re a human?
You don’t know right? You probably don’t know
My heart towards you is love, love love

‘Cause, you’re my earth, air, water, fire
(You’re my) earth, air, water, fire

Me who’s looking at you looking at me looking at you
You who’s looking at me, me who’s looking at you

Look into your, butter-butterflies
The sky that doesn’t end. I swim in your eyes
Only you make me shine. I can see the future
It can’t be if it’s not you
To you who made me reborn, incredible

The moment I met you, I threw away the world because it was boring
Looking at the same place, laughing and crying together
You’re quite like this, like this, like this

Reality doesn’t come. Why isn’t this a dream?
Even I don’t believe it. Is it right that you’re a human?
You don’t know right? You probably don’t know
My heart towards you is love, love love

Me who’s looking at you looking at me looking at you
You who’s looking at me, me who’s looking at you
Me who’s looking at you looking at me looking at you
You who’s looking at me, me who’s looking at you

Now I won’t go again to a place where you aren’t present
Now without you, nothing, clear away that exit
Now I don’t have anything else to hope for, will you stay with me?

The moment I cross over, I can’t go back
No, before that, I don’t have the heart to
I can’t even imagine a place without you, love, love, love

Reality doesn’t come. Why isn’t this a dream?
Even I don’t believe it. Is it right that you’re a human?
It’s quite a relief, isn’t it? That I came to know you, that we came to fall in love, love, love, love
                        
                    |
