                        Bài hát : Daisy - Zedd

[Verse 1]
Daisy, always climbing up the same tree
Finding love in all the wrong scenes, Daisy, you got me
Daisy, always walking down the wrong streets
Starting fires out of dead weeds, Daisy, you got me

[Chorus]
Let me show you how a kiss should taste
Trust me, I won't give your heart away
Why you running, running when you got it right here?
Oh, I would love you if you let me
[Verse 2]
Daisy, always dancing to the same beat
Broken record stuck on repeat, Daisy, you got me
Daisy, don't you know that you're amazing?
Broken hearts just keeps on breaking, Daisy
And I would take the light out of the stars to help you see
Anything to guide you straight to me

[Chorus]
Let me show you how a kiss should taste
Trust me, I won't give your heart away
Why you running, running when you got it right here?
Oh, I would love you if you let me
Let me show you how a kiss should taste
Trust me, I won't give your heart away
Why you running, running when you got it right here?
Oh, I would love you if you let me

[Outro]
I won't give your heart away
Why you running, running when you got it right here?
                        
                    |
