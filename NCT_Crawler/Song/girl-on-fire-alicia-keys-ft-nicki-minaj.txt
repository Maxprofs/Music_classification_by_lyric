                        Bài hát: Girl On Fire - Alicia Keys, Nicki Minaj

[Nicki Minaj]
Spirit of Marilyn calling me, audibly
Bawling she, said that she would never leave
Continued to torture me
Telling me to come with her
Underneath my comforter
And she brought a gun with her
Pills and some rum with her
Tip me on the balcony telling me to jump with her
Yeah Im in the ghost but I aint doing stunts with her
I aint tryna be that but haters wanna see that
But I got em aggy cause I win the gold like Gabby

[Alicia Keys]
Shes just a girl and shes on fire
Hotter than a fantasy, lonely like a highway
Shes living in a world and its on fire
Feelin' the catastrophe, but she knows she can fly away

Oh, she got both feet on the ground
And shes burning it down
Oh, she got her head in the clouds
And shes not backing down

[Chorus]
This girl is on fire
This girl is on fire
Shes walking on fire
This girl is on fire

[Alicia Keys]
Looks like a girl but shes a flame
So bright she can burn your eyes
Better look the other way
You can try but youll never forget her name
Shes on top of the world
Hottest of the hottest girls

Say Oh!, we got our feet on the ground
And were burning it down
Oh, got our head in the clouds
And were not coming down

[Chorus]
This girl is on fire
This girl is on fire
Shes walking on fire
This girl is on fire

[Alicia Keys]
Everybody stares as she goes by
Cause they can see the flame thats in her eyes
Watch her when shes lighting up the night
Nobody knows that shes a lonely girl
And its a lonely world
But she gon let it burn baby burn baby

[Nicki Minaj]
Dear God, If you hear, God?
Make the fire disappear when they see her, God
Take away my fear when they interfere. God
Do you fear God? Cause I fear God
And in my backyard, thats a deer, God
And thats a horse ranch
And to my core fans keep repping me
Do it to the death of me
X in the box cause aint nobody checking me

[Chorus]
This girl is on fire
This girl is on fire
Shes walking on fire
This girl is on fire

Oh, oh, oh,oh, ooooohhhhh

Shes just a girl, and shes on fire
                        
                    |
