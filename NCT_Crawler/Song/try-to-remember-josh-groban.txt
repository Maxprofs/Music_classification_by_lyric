                        Bài hát: Try To Remember - Josh Groban

Try to remember the kind of September
when life was slow and oh, so mellow.
Try to remember the kind of September
when grass was green and grain so yellow.
Try to remember the kind of September
when you were a young and callow fellow,
Try to remember and if you remember then follow.

Try to remember when life was so tender
that no one wept except the willow.
Try to remember when life was so tender 
That dreams were kept beside your pillow.
Try to remember when life was so tender 
That love was an ember about to billow.
Try to remember and if you remember then follow.

Deep in December it's nice to remember
although you know the snow will follow.
Deep in December it's nice to remember
without the hurt the heart is hollow.
Deep in December it's nice to remember
the fire of September that made you mellow.
Deep in December our hearts should remember then follow.
