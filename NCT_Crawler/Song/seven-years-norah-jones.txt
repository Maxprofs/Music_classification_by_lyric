                        Title: Seven Years
Artist: Norah Jones
Spinning, laughing,dancing 
To her favorite song
A little girl 
With nothing wrong
Is all alone
Eyes wide open
Always hoping for the sun
And she'll sing her song 
To anyone
That comes along 
Fragile as a leaf in autumn
Just fallin' to the ground
Without a sound 
Crooked little smile 
On her face
Tells a tale of grace
That's all her own
LYRIC:BÉ PUM
Fragile as a leaf in autumn 
Just fallin' to the ground 
Without a sound
Spinning, laughing, dancing 
To her favorite song
She's a little girl 
With nothing wrong
And she's all alone
A little girl 
With nothing wrong
And she's all alone
