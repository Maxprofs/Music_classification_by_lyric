                        Bài hát: Girl You Are My Love - Đàm Vĩnh Hưng

Girl you are my love
You're my heart and soul
You're my shining star
My love is just for you
I'll be feeling blue
Living without you.

Every breath that I take
And every step I want to make
I want to share my love with you
Right till the end of time.

[Chorus]
I want to hold you by my side
I want to make you stay tonight
Girl somehow I know deep inside
Your heart that you need my tender touch.
                        
                    |
