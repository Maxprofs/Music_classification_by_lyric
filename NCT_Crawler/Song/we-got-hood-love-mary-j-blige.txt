Mary J. Blige Ft. Trey Songz - We Got Hood Love

Somtimes I don't get a chance to really to tell you
But I promise you my love i'll never fail you
Don't you get it?
Each day we're writing history
A thousand years from now they'll talk about you & me
And I know somtimes I go hard for no reason at all
Put your soul through the business and touch the weight of your heart
Coswhen you're backs on the wall there's a shortage of friends
You know that I'm with you till the end

Cause we got hood love, cause I be cussing I be screaming
Like its over
Then im loving then im feening just to hold ya
And thats how we do
You know that hood love is the good love
Thats me & you
How feel love?
Well im with ya never quit ya &
Now thats real love
When your not here then I miss ya cuz
I still love the way we do
You know that hood love is the good love
Ya thats me & you

Sometimes I think about leaving you
But wen I think about what we've been through
I get a feeling like it could be worse
Cuz ive given u my best and I dont mind it
Thats fine
Cause wen you loving somebody hard then you'll love that way for life
You got all of my heart and i'll never leave ya side
I gave my words to love all the way to the end
So no matter what i'll be right here
I'll be right here with you

Cause we got hood love, cause I be cussing I be screaming
Like its over
Then im loving then im feening just to hold ya
And thats how we do
You know that hood love is the good love
Thats me & you
How you feel love?
Well im with ya never quit ya &
Now thats real love
When your not here then I miss ya cuz
I still love the way that we do
You know that hood love is the good love
Ya thats me & you

Now i'll play tough but not for too long
You are somone I depend on
No matter how I act sometimes I can never walk away
Thought about it plenty times but no can take ya place

Ooooh and there aint no you, then there aint no me
And if there aint no us then i'd rather be by myself
Cuz noone else can understand my history and treat me like I need

Cause we got hood love, cause I be cussing I be screaming
Like its over
Then im loving then im feening just to hold ya
And thats how we do
You know that hood love is the good love
Thats me & you
How you feel love?
Well im with ya never quit ya &
Now thats real love
When your not here then I miss ya cuz
I still love the way we do
You know that hood love is the good love
Ya thats me & you
