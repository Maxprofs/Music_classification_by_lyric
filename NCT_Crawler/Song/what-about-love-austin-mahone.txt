                        What About Love"

[Verse 1]
I-I'm feeling your thunder
The storm’s getting closer
This rain is like fire
And my-my world’s going under
And I can’t remember
The reason that you cut off the line

[Bridge]
You’re moving on, you say
Here I stay
I’ll take this pain
Yeah, I can, I can

[Chorus]
What about love?
What about our promises?
What about love?
You take it all and leave me nothing
What about love?
What about us ’til we end?
What about love?
You cut my wings, now I am falling
What about love? [x2]

[Verse 2]
Why you're colder than winter?
You’re switching the picture
You used to be perfect, yeah (yeah)
Once you’re hot like the summer
Please help me remember
The reason that you said “bye bye bye”

[Bridge]
You’re moving on, you say
Here I stay
I’ll take this pain
Yeah, I can, I can

[Chorus]
What about love?
What about our promises?
What about love?
You take it all and leave me nothing
What about love?
What about us ’til we end?
What about love?
You cut my wings, now I am falling
What about love? [x2]

[Middle 8 - x4]
Uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh
What about-what about love?

[Bridge]
You’re moving on, you say
Here I stay
Watching every night get colder
You’re moving on, you say
Here I stay
I’ll take this pain
Yeah, I can, I can

[Chorus]
What about love?
What about our promises?
What about love?
You take it all and leave me nothing
What about love?
What about us ’til we end?
What about love?
You cut my wings, now I am falling
What about love? [x2]

What about-what about
What about love?
What about-what about
What about love?
