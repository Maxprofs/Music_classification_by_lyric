                        Bài hát: Looking For Your Name - Armin van Buuren, Gavin DeGraw

Baby can I hold your skin
Can I get a scent of the mood you’re in
I’ve been floating on this sea for so long
I wouldn’t recognize a place called home

Oh and what a moment that was
How I got a taste of you in my blood
And remember how I wrote your name
On the rocks down by the river Seine

You said oh, nobody sees us
And Jesus, it was cold
And I laughed because it was just too late
Even though I don’t know if it’s safe I’ll jump in it

I would do anything to find
And underneath the sky 
That’s full of stars
I’m looking for your name tonight

Maybe if I chase this dream
I’ll feel how you intoxicated me
Upon the bridge I hear a radio play
And it sounds like something you would say

And the feeling’s oh so holy as I dive tonight alone
Singing, you’re gonna miss me when I’m gone
Even though I don’t know if it’s safe I’ll jump in it
I would do anything to find

And underneath the sky 
That’s full of stars
I’m looking for your name tonight
If you ever return to this place and come searching

For the message I leave behind
It’s underneath this sky
That’s full of stars
I was looking for your name
Tonight
                        
                    |
