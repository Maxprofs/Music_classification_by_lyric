                        I have been in love
and been alone
I have traveled over many miles
to find a home
there's that little place
inside of me
that I never thought could
take control of everything
but now I just spend all my time
with anyone
who makes me feel
the way she does

[Chorus:]

'Cause I only feel alive
when I dream at night
even though she's not real
it's all right
'cause I only feel alive
when I dream at night
every move that she makes
holds my eyes
and I fall for her every time

I've so many things I want to say
I'll be ready when
the perfect moment
comes my way
I had never known
what's right for me
'til the night
she opened up my heart
and set it free
But now I just spend all my time
with anyone
who makes me feel
the way she does

[Repeat Chorus]

Now I just spend all my time
with anyone
who makes me feel
the way she does
                        
                    |
