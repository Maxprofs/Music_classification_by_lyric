                        I know you loved him
A long time ago
Even now in my arms
You still want him I know

But darling this time
Let your memories die
When you hold me tonight
Don't close your eyes

Don't close your eyes
Let it be me
Don't pretend it's him
In some fantasy
Darling just once
Let yesterday go
You'll find more love
Than you've ever known
Just hold me tight
When you love me tonight
Don't close your eyes

Maybe I've been a fool
Holding on all this time
Lying here in your arms
Knowing he's in your mind
But I keep hoping someday
That you'll see the light
Let it be me tonight
And Don't close your eyes

Don't close your eyes
Let it be me
Don't pretend it's him
In some fantasy
Darling just once
Let yesterday just go
You'll find more love
Than you've ever known
Just hold me tight
When you love me tonight
Don't close your eyes (x2)
