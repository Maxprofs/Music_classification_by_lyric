Rock|

                        Well, I broke down in East St. Louis
 The Kansas City line
 Drunk up all my money that I borrowed every time
 And I fell down at the derby
 The night's as black as a crow
 It was a train that took me away from here
 But a train can't bring me home
 What made my dreams so hollow was standing at the depot
 With a steeple full of swallows that could never ring the bell
 And I've come ten thousand miles away, not one thing to show
 It was a train that took me away from here
 But a train can't bring me home I remember when I left without bothering to pack
 Don't you know I up and left
 With just the clothes I had on my back?
 Now, I'm sorry for what I've done
 And I'm out here on my own
 It was a train that took me away from here
 But a train can't bring me home
 It was a train that took me away from here
 But a train can't bring me home
                        
                    |
