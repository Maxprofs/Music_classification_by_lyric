                        When the world is filled with thunder
 And the winds are storming above
 Deep within the night we wonder
 If we've lost the magic of love
 But there's something inside us
 That looks to the sun
 We dream that this light will guide us
 With love for everyone
 When the birds of war are flying
 And the clouds are heavy with rain
 Seems as though the skies are crying
 And we feel the cold tears of pain
 But there's something inside us
 That looks to the sun
 We dream that this light will guide us
 With love for everyone
 Love is there for us, everywhere for us
 (In the sound of praying, little children playing)
 Open your heart
 Love to each of us, here in each of us
 (Constant as the moon glows, or the way the grass grows)
 Always and forever
 Love is the river that fills every sea
 Waters that mirror the way life should be
 When the world is free of thunder
 And the skies are peaceful above
 Once again we'll know the wonder
 Of the magic power of love
 Oh, the magic of love
                        
                    |
