                        Bài hát: Dream Lantern (English Version) - RADWIMPS

Ahh, if only you our voices speaking at night could ever reach the very edge of this world, and of time
Instead of fading into air and dust

Then what were the words? Could it ever be the farthest words from "probably"?
Let's make a promise that we'll never fade— let's say it together on the count of three!

Ahh, I'm told that some part of every wish will be heard, but lately I lose sight of the truth in those words...
I can't even remember; when I give up believin', what could have been the reason?

Ahh, the very moment that the rain will stop, in that place a rainbow is born and dies
And where the end of this light flies, I've always been insisting there was something that I've been longing for

One day I'll reach the emotions unexplored and unprecedented—
We'll high-five love we've yet to discover, and give a kiss to time!

The 5th dimension keeps on teasing me, but I will keep on looking at you, dear!
Let's make a sign for when we say, "Nice to meet ya again!"
I'm on my way to you, chasing after your name!
                        
                    |
