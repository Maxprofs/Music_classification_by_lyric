                        Limpin' as you do and I'm watchin' you
 And you don't really know just what to do You don't really know
 You don't really know
 You don't really know what to do Well I'm standin' here, not quite aware
 And I'm tryin' baby, tryin' not to stare 'Cause everybody else is here
 Yes, everybody else is here
 Everybody else is here watchin' you 'Cause everybody else is here
 Yes, everybody else is here
 Everybody else is here watchin' us
