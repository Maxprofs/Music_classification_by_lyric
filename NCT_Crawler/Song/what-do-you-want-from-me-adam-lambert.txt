                        Bài hát: What Do You Want From Me - Adam Lambert

Hey, slow it down
Whataya want from me?
Whataya want from me?
Yeah, I’m afraid. Whataya want from me?
Whataya want from me?

There might have been a time
When I would give myself away
Oooh, once upon a time I didn’t give a damn
But now, here we are, so whataya want from me?
Whataya want from me?

Just don’t give up, I’m workin' it out
Please don’t give in, I won’t let you down
It messed me up, need a second to breathe
Just keep comin' around
Hey, whataya want from me?
Whataya want from me?
Whataya want from me?

Yeah, it’s plain to see (plain to see)
that baby, you’re beautiful
And there's nothing wrong with you (nothing wrong with you)
It’s me, I’m a freak (yeah), but thanks for lovin’ me
'Cause you’re doing it perfectly (it perfectly)

Yeah, there might have been a time
When I would let you slip away
I wouldn’t even try but I think you could save my life.

Just don’t give up, I’m workin’ it out
Please don’t give in, I won’t let you down
It messed me up, need a second to breathe
Just keep comin' around
Hey, whataya want from me?
Whataya want from me?
Whataya want from me?

Just don’t give up on me
I won’t let you down. No, I won’t let you down

(So I) Just don’t give up, I’m workins it out
Please don’t give in, I won’t let you down
It messed me up, need a second to breathe
Just keep coming around
Hey, whataya want from me?

Just don’t give up, I’m workin’ it out
Please don’t give in, I won’t let you down
It messed me up, need a second to breathe
Just keep comin' around
Hey, whataya want from me?
Whataya want from me?
Whataya want from me?
