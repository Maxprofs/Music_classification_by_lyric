                        Have you seen her? So fine and pretty
 Fooled me with her style an' ease
 And I feel her from across the room
 Yes, it's love in the third degree Ooh baby, baby
 Won't cha turn your head my way?
 Ooh baby, baby
 Come on, take a chance
 You're old enough to Dance the night away
 Oh, come on g-girl
 Dance the night away A live wire, barely a beginner
 But just watch that lady go
 She's on fire 'cause dancin' gets her higher
 Than anything else she knows Ooh baby, baby
 Won't cha turn your head my way?
 Ooh baby, baby
 Well, don't skip romance
 'Cause you're old enough to Dance the night away
 Oh, come on g-girl
 Dance the night away Oh, oh, oh
 Dance the night away
 Dance, dance, dance the night away
 Dance the night away
 Dance, dance, dance the night away Come on baby, baby
 Dance the night away
 Dance the night away
 Dance, dance, dance the night away Come on baby, baby
 Dance the night away
 Dance, dance, dance the night away
 Dance the night away
 Dance the night away
