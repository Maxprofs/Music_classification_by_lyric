                        Bài hát: Unexpectedly - Jason Chen

I have always been a man with a plan
Always prepared, never once to lave it to chance
But It's all unscripted, when I'm with you
It seems familiar, yet it all feels so new

All of a sudden I miss you
Thinking 'bout all of the things that we've been through
Oh no it's not that I planned to
But I think it feels like

Maybe I'm falling for you and me
Just don't know
Oh were we ever meant to be
Suddenly, oh you caught me
So off guard We fell in love so unexpectedly
So unexpectedly

I've known you for five years and a day
Never once thought I'd have these words to say
I wanna hold you and kiss you
Untill the end of time and when you're out of sight oh

All of a sudden I miss you
Thinking 'bout all of the things that we've been through
Oh no it's not that i planned to
But I think it feels like

Maybe I'm falling for you and me
Just don't know oh
Were we ever meant to be
Suddenly, oh you caught me
So off guard, We fell in love so unexpectedly

You're the one I'm searching for
Was right here all along
Now I see
I see you standing right in front of me
You're the one I'm searching for
Was right here all along,
How did we
We fall in love so unexpectedly

Just don't know oh
Were we ever meant to be
Suddenly oh
You caught me so off guard
We fell in love so unexpectedly
So unexpectedly
We fell in love so unexpectedly
                        
                    |
