                        Open arms wide as I reach for the blue skies
 To embrace we'll love her now
 We were made to last for a lifetime
 Searching the world to find our souls
 We're not gonna let you fall
 Behind behind behind
 We're gonna live, we'll never die (die, die, die, die) We'll never
 Die

 Die
 Die We're gonna live, we'll never

 Die Open arms wide as I reach for the blue skies
 To embrace we'll love her now
 We were made to last for a lifetime
 Searching the world to find our souls
 Deep in the darkest hour of night
 We're not gonna let you fall behind
 We're not afraid of losing time
 We're gonna live, well never die (die, die, die, die) We'll never
 Die

 Die Gonna live, we'll never
