                        I'm trippin', my niggas say I'm slackin' on my pimpin'
 She got me all in the mix
 And I just can't leave her alone 'cause sometime
 When I text her' she don't write back Shorty got her own life but I like that
 She got my head all messed up
 And I just don't know what to do about it Don't care what nobody say
 I'm goin' to do it my way I know that
 Everybody got an opinion
 But you gonna still be mine 'Cause I know my baby loves me
 She gives me all that I need
 So everybody can just say they opinion
 And leave us alone She want it all
 But I'm about to give it to her
 'Cause that's my baby girl
 (Oh, that's my baby girl) And everybody knows
 That I'm about to give it to her
 'Cause that's my baby girl
 (Oh, that's my baby girl) She's my baby girl, baby girl
 Baby girl, baby girl
 Baby girl, baby girl, baby girl
 It's my baby girl Friends don't like her
 Mom don't approve
 But I don't care what they say
 'Cause you're my boo And if they gonna hate I'ma let them hate
 'Cause they just don't understand so I can't
 Pay attention to what I be hearin'
 She gonna be the mother to all of my children
 So everybody y'all can step back
 'Cause I made up my mind Don't care what nobody say
 I'm goin' to do it my way
 I know that verybody got an opinion
 But you gonna still be mine 'Cause I know my baby loves me
 She gives me all that I need
 So everybody can just say they opinion
 And leave us alone She want it all
 But I'm about to give it to her
 'Cause that's my baby girl
 (Oh, that's my baby girl) And everybody knows
 That I'm about to give it to her
 'Cause that's my baby girl
 (Oh, that's my baby girl) She's my baby girl, baby girl
 Baby girl, baby girl
 Baby girl, baby girl, baby girl
 It's my baby girl I don't care what nobody gotta say
 They spectators so let the spectators spectate
 Love the way how my baby look in them stilettos
 Look even betta when ya ridin' in my yellow
 Lambo plus she got a prince as a fellow Nuggets in the Chanel watch like Carmelo
 She my b, a, b, y and we fly G5 from the take off let's get lost
 Ya now rollin' with the best
 Hard days at work I'll ease that stress
 So hood she don't deserve nothin' less
 Now we both livin' that good life like Kanye West This girl got me sprung and I don't care who knows it knows it
 Yeah, she might be a little freaky but at least she only freaky with me
 This is my situation and I chose it, chose it
 I can have any chick that I want but I want the one that I'm with She want it all
 But I'm about to give it to her
 'Cause that's my baby girl
 (Oh, that's my baby girl) And everybody knows
 That I'm about to give it to her
 'Cause that's my baby girl
 (Oh, that's my baby girl) She's my baby girl, baby girl
 Baby girl, baby girl
 Baby girl, baby girl, baby girl
 It's my baby girl I ain't scared to let the world know
 I ain't scared to let the world know
 Niggas might have a body
 But I got a mind and a heart
 It's a whole other ball game right there
