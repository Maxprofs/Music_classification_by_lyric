                        Bài hát: All I Have To Do Is Dream - Guitar

Dream, dream, dream, dream 
Dream, dream, dream, dream 

When I want you in my arms 
When I want you and now your charms 
Whenever I want you 
All I have to do is dream 
Dream, dream, dream 

When I want you in the night 
When I want you to hold me tight 
Whenever I want you 
All I have to do is dream 

I can make you mine 
Taste your lips of wine 
Anytime night or day 
Only trouble is, gee whiz 
I'm dreaming my life away 

I need you so and that is why 
I love you so, don't say goodbye 
Whenever I want you 
All I have to dream 

I can make you mine 
Taste your lips of wine 
Anytime night or day 
Only trouble is, gee whiz 
I'm dreaming my life away 

I need you so and that is why 
I love you so, don't say goodbye 
Whenever I want you 
All I have to dream 

Dream, dream, dream, dream 
Dream, dream, dream, dream 
Dream, dream, dream, dream
                        
                    |
