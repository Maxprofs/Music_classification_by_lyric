                        Bài hát: Piggyback - Melanie Martinez

I was three years old
All I wanted was the music
And my parents were doing everything they could
To move away from our place
Working over time always
While I sat up in my grandma's
Project building coloring

Oh
Moved to a small town
And started to started to grow
Poetry written, I’m singing and dancing
Oh
Photographs, painting, cartoons
That's all I know
That's all I know

I've one best friend to this very *** day
Since we were five years old and I *** moved away
I wish I never did 'cause she’s the only one who sees me for who I really am
Instead of how many I reach

Oh
Trusted too many fake people while I was still young
Gave them the benefit of the doubt
I was so wrong
I cut them off and they came for blood
'Cause they know they ain't getting no more

I’m so done with playing piggy back, oh
Swear to god I wished y’all all the best, oh
You’re lying your way to try and gain a piece of me
When you could never come close 'cause I know my destiny
I worked hard for my ***
Put my love in this ***
Now you’re trying to kill my name for some fame
What is this?
Tried to help you do your ***
Encouraged you to work on it
Was a good friend and you used that to your advantage

Now I’m twenty-two and I have had a crazy year
Of isolation from all the plastic people here
I can not wait for the day I can finally move away back to New York City
Where the realest people really stay

Oh
Spent this whole time writing away my heart and my soul
The people I surround myself with have hearts filled with gold
Love and empathy are things that we hold so close
Trying to learn and evolve

I’m so done with playing piggy back, oh
Swear to god I wished y’all all the best, oh
You’re lying your way to try and gain a piece of me
When you could never come close 'cause I know my destiny
I worked hard for my ***
Put my love in this ***
Now you’re trying to kill my name for some fame
What is this?
Tried to help you do your ***
Encouraged you to work on it
Was a good friend and you used that to your advantage

I’m so done with playing piggy back, oh
Swear to god I wished y’all all the best, oh
You’re lying your way to try and gain a piece of me
When you could never come close 'cause I know my destiny
                        
                    |
