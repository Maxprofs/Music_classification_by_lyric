                        Raise your voices, raise your voices
 Praise to Him thy living word
 To the Heavens high ascending
 Raise your voices to the Lord Though your nights be dark and fearful
 Though we face the dimming day
 Though the heart be sad and tearful
 Trust Him, He will light the way Raise your voices, raise your voices
 Praise to Him the living word
 To the Heavens high ascending
 Raise your voices to the Lord Through the mists in this vale of sorrow
 Through the glass we but darkly see
 We will rise again tomorrow
 Then our eyes will lifted be Raise your voices, raise your voices
 Praise to Him the living word
 To the Heavens high ascending
 Raise your voices to the Lord Long the road that has no ending
 Far the path that has no turn
 And the soul is never wending
 To the place it first was born See the host of Angels singing
 When they hear that trumpet sound
 When the piper's call is ringing
 Then shall my soul be ever homeward bound Raise your voices, raise your voices
 Praise to Him the living word
 To the Heavens high ascending
 Raise your voices to the Lord Mountains tall and seas will thunder
 One unceasing chorus ring
 Heaven and earth will sleep no longer
 Then the universe as one will sing Raise your voices, raise your voices
 Praise to Him the living word
 To the Heavens high ascending
 Raise your voices to the Lord
 Raise your voices to the Lord
                        
                    |
