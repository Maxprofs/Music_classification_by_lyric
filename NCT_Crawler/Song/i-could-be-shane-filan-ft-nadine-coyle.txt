                        Bài hát: I Could Be - Shane Filan, Nadine Coyle 

I look at you in frozen eyes, cold as ice
You wanna bring me back, back to life
You say I know better on my own
But if I'm lonely to the bone
What a great sacrifice being all locked up inside

I could be the first to let you in
I could help you find a place again
Let me be the one to open up that door
I could make the sun come out
Warm you up and melt you down
I could be the first to let you in your heart again

Are you searching for somewhere to hide
You know I think I am, but wanna try
We're no better on our own if we're lonely to the bone
We don't have to be tonight
I will you free your mind

I could be the first to let you in
I could help you find a place again
Let me be the one to open up that door
I could make the sun come out
Warm you up and melt you down
I could be the first to let you in your heart
I could be the first to let you in
To help you find that place again
Let me be the one to open up that door
I could make the sun come out
Warm you up and melt you down
I could be the first to let you in your heart

You know I wanna set you free
Then come to me
