                        Mary's boy child Jesus Christ, was born on Christmas Day.
And man will live for evermore, because of Christmas Day.

Long time ago in Bethlehem, so the Holy Bible say,
Mary's boy child Jesus Christ, was born on Christmas Day.

Hark, now hear the angels sing, a king was born today,
And man will live for evermore, because of Christmas Day.
Mary's boy child Jesus Christ, was born on Christmas Day.

While shepherds watch their flocks by night,
they see a bright new shining star,
they hear a choir sing a song, the music seemed to come from afar.

Hark, now hear the angels sing, a king was born today,
And man will live for evermore, because of Christmas Day.

Mmmmmm......

For a moment the world was aglow, all the bells rang out
there were tears of joy and laughter, people shouted
"let everyone know, there is hope for all to find peace".

Now Joseph and his wife Mary came to Bethlehem that night
they found no place to bear her child not a single room was in sight
And then they found a little nook, in a stable all forlorn.
And in a manger cold and dark, Mary's little boy was born.

Hark, now hear the angels sing, a king was born today,
And man will live for evermore, because of Christmas Day
Mary's boy child, Jesus Christ, was born on Christmas Day.

For a moment the world was aglow, all the bells rang out
there were tears of joy and laughter, people shouted
"let everyone know, there is hope for all to find peace".

Oh my Lord, You sent your son to save us
Oh my Lord, Your very self you gave us
Oh my Lord, That sin may not enslave us
And love may reign once more

Oh my Lord, when in the crib they found Him
Oh my Lord, A golden halo crowned Him
Oh my Lord, They gathered all around Him
To see him and adore (this day will live forever)

Oh my Lord (so praise the Lord)
with the child's adoration
Oh my Lord (He is a personation)
there came great jubilation
Oh my Lord (so praise the Lord)
and full of admiration
they realized what they had (until the sun falls from the sky)

Oh my Lord (so praise the Lord)
they had begun to doubt you
Oh my Lord (He is the truth forever)
what did they know about you?
Oh my Lord (so praise the Lord)
but they were lost without You
they needed You so bad (His light is shining on us)

Oh my Lord (so praise the Lord)
with the child's adoration
Oh my Lord (He is a personation)
there came great jubilation
Oh my Lord (so praise the Lord)
and full of admiration
they realized what they had (until the sun falls from the sky)

Oh my Lord (Oh praise the Lord)
