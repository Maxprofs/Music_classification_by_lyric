                        [Kanye West]
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

 I fantasized about this back in Chicago
 Mercy, mercy me, that Murcielago
 That's me, the first year that I blow
 How you say broke in Spanish? Me no hablo
 Me drown sorrow in that Diablo
 Me found bravery in my bravado
 Dj's need to listen to the model's
 You ain't got no f-ckin' Yeezy in your Serrato?
 (You ain't got no Yeezy, n-gga?)
 Stupid, but what the f-ck do I know?
 I'm just a Chi-town n-gga with a Nas flow
 And my bitch in that new Phoebe Philo
 So much head, I woke up to Sleepy Hollow

 (Jon Anderson)
 Can we get much higher? (higher, higher)
 Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

 Look like a fat booty Celine Dion
 S** is on fire, I'm the King of Leon-a Lewis
 Beyond the truest
 Hey, teacher, teacher
 Tell me how do you respawn the students?
 And refresh the page and restart the memory?
 Respark the soul and rebuild the energy?
 We stopped the ignorance, we killed the enemies
 Sorry for the night demons still visit me
 The plan was to drink until the pain over
 But what's worse, the pain or the hangover?
 Fresh air, rolling down the window
 Too many Urkels on your team, that's why your wins low
 Don't make me pull the toys out, huh
 Don't make me pull the toys
 And fire up the engines
 And then they make noooise

 (Jon Anderson)
 Can we get much higher? (higher, higher)
 Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

 At the mall there was a seance
 Just kids, no parents
 Then the sky filled with heron
 (I saw the devil) In a Chrysler Lebaron
 And the hell, it wouldn't spare us
 (And the fires did declare us)
 (But after that, took pills, kissed an heiress)
 (And moved her back in Paris)

 (Jon Anderson)
 Can we get much higher? (higher, higher)
 Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

 Can we get much higher? (higher, higher)
 Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oha
