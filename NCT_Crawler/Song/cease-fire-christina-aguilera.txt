                        Song: Cease Fire - Christina Aguilera



[2x]

Yeah yeah yeah

Yeah yeah yeah

Yeah yeah yeah, yeah



Yeah yeah yeah

Yeah yeah yeah

Yeah yeah yeah, yeah (oh oh)



Inglorious soldier I stand 'til the end

A golden revolver I hold in my hand

The trigger that I never squeeze

The war that brings me to my knees



I'm tired of fighting for peace

When I am alone on the front line

I need you to stand next to me



Baby, cease fire, fire, fire

Throw down your weapons, your weapons, your weapons

I'm on your side, on your side, on your side

So please cease fire, fire, fire

Cease fire, make it stop



Drop down your defences, I'm raising my flag

This fighting is hopeless, we need this to end

It's going too far, don't know where it began

We're hurting each other and I can't pretend



I'm trying to help you to see

The casualties that we both leave

It's all so unnecessary

Can't you hear me scream?



Baby, cease fire, fire, fire

Throw down your weapons, your weapons, your weapons

I'm on your side, on your side, on your side

So please cease fire, fire, fire

Cease fire make it stop



[2x]

Uh uh uh ooh

Uh uh uh ooh

Uh uh ooh

Uh uh oh



Rolling out

White flag

I surrender

Hear me now

Make it stop

We can do better

Pain and hurt

Living in fear

Wasted energy

In the end

What is it worth?

What is our legacy?



Rolling out

White flag

I surrender

Hear me now

Make it stop

We can do better



Pain and hurt

Living in fear

Wasted energy

In the end

What is it worth?

What is our legacy?



Follow me now

I'm calling out

Somebody help me



I need you now

Why can't you see?

Gotta believe me



Fighting for peace

Need a release

Won't you come with me?



I'm on your side

Swallow your pride

You can confide in me



Army of one

Rise of the sun

Shining for all to see



Enemy's none

Victory's won

No negativity



We can be free,

We have the key

To own our destiny



Baby, cease fire, fire, fire

Throw down your weapons, your weapons, your weapons

I'm on your side, on your side, on your side

So please cease fire, fire, fire

Cease fire make it stop
