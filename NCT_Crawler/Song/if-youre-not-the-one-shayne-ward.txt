                        Title: If You're Not The One
Artist: Shayne Ward
If you’re not the one 
then why does my soul feel glad today?
If you’re not the one 
then why does my hand fit yours this way?
If you are not mine 
then why does your heart return my call
If you are not mine 
would I have the strength to stand at all
...
I'll never know what the future brings
But I know you're here with me now
We’ll make it through
And I hope you are the one 
I share my life with
...
I don’t want to run away 
but I can’t take it, I don’t understand
If I’m not made for you 
then why does my heart 
tell me that I am?
Is there any way 
that I can stay in your arms?
...
‘Cause I love you, 
whether it’s wrong or right
And though I can’t be with you tonight
You know my heart is by your side
I don’t want to run away 
but I can’t take it, I don’t understand
If I’m not made for you 
then why does my heart 
tell me that I am
Is there any way 
that I could stay in your arms
....
