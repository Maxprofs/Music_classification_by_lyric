                        A Little Party Never Killed Nobody (All We Got) - Fergie, Q-Tip, GoonRock

[Verse 1 Fergie:]
I ain’t got time for you baby
Either you’re mine, or you’re not
Make up your mind sweet baby
Right here, right now’s all we got
A little party never killed nobody
So we gon’ dance until we drop, drop
A little party never killed nobody
Right here, right now’s all we got

At least I miss trips around the world
Don’t mean a thing if I ain’t your girl
A little party never killed nobody
So we gon’ dance until we drop, drop
A little party never killed nobody
Right here, right now’s all we got
A little party never killed nobody
So we gon’ dance until we drop, drop
A little party never killed nobody
Right here, right now’s all we got

[Q-Tip]
All we got, all we got, all we got, all we got
All we got, all we got, all we got, all we got
Glad that you made it, look around
You don’t see one person sitting down
They got drinks in their hands,
And the room’s a bust
At the end of the night maybe you’ll find love
Fake chit chat ’bout the things they got
And my scout reputation keeping it hot girl
At the party of the year I’m a master plan
If you make me realize I’m your man

[Fergie:]
If the people get lost, underneath the moonlight
Hectic topic, paparazzi, hold it while I take this pic
Speak easy, rocking the feathers I’m breezy
Hope you can keep up boys, cause believe me, I’m a beat mean

It don’t mean a thing if I give you my heart,
If you tear it apart, no, uh, uh, ah, oh
It don’t mean a thing if I ain’t in your eyes,
Probably ain’t gonna fly, no, uh, uh, ah, oh
It don’t mean a thing if I give you my heart,
If you tear it apart, no, uh, uh, ah, oh
It don’t mean a thing if I ain’t in your eyes,
Probably ain’t gonna fly, no, uh, uh, ah, oh

Just one night’s all we got
Just one night’s all we got
Just one night’s all we got
Just one night’s all we got

What do you think? You rock?
Are you ready?

A little party never killed nobody
So we gon’ dance until we drop, drop
A little party never killed nobody
Right here, right now’s all we got

A little party never killed nobody
So we gon’ dance until we drop, drop
A little party never killed nobody
