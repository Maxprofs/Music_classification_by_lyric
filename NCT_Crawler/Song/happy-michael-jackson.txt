                        Bài hát: Happy - Michael Jackson

Sadness had been
Close as my next of kin
Then happy came one day
Chased my blues away

My life began when happy smiled
Sweet like candy to a child
Stay here and love me just a while
Let sadness see what happy does
Let happy be where sadness was

Happy, that's you
You made my life brand new
Lost as a little lamb was I
Till you came in

My life began when happy smiled
Sweet like candy to a child
Stay here and love me just a while
Let sadness see what happy does
Let happy be where sadness was till now

Where have I been? What lifetime was I in?
Suspended between time and space
Lonely until happy came smiling up at me

Sadness had no choice but to flee
I said a prayer so silently
Let sadness see what happy does
Let happy be where sadness was till now

Happy, ooh, yeah, happy
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Happy, ooh, yeah, happy
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Happy, ooh, yeah, happy
                        
                    |
