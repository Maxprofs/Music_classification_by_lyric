                        Bài hát: Do They Know It's Christmas? - Band Aid

It's Christmas time, there's no need to be afraid

[Ed Sheeran:]
At Christmas time, we let in light and we banish shade

[Rita Ora:]
And in our world of plenty we can spread our smile of joy

[Sam Smith:]
Feel your arms around the world at Christmas time

[Paloma Faith:]
But say a prayer and pray for the other ones

[Emeli Sandé:]
At Christmas time its hard but while you’re having fun

[Guy Garvey:]
There’s a world outside your window 
and it’s a world of dread and fear

[Dan Smith:]
Where a kiss of love can kill you

[Angelique Kidjo:]
Where there’s death in every tear

[Chris Martin:]
And the Christmas bells that ring there 
are the clanging chimes of doom

[Bono:]
Well tonight we’re reaching out and touching you

[Seal:]
Bring peace and joy this Christmas to West Africa

[Ellie Goulding:]
A song of hope where there’s no hope tonight

[Sinéad O'Connor:]
Why is comfort to be feared, why is to touch to be scared?

[Bono:]
How can they know it’s Christmas time at all?

[One Direction:]
Here’s to you

[Olly Murs:]
Raise a glass to everyone

[Dan Smith:]
Here’s to them

[Sam Smith:]
And all there is to come

[Rita Ora:]
Can they know it’s Christmas time at all?

[All:]
Feed the world
Let them know it’s Christmas time again

Feed the world
Let them know it’s Christmas time again

Feed the world
Let them know it’s Christmas time again

Feed the world
Let them know it’s Christmas time again

Feed the world
Let them know it’s Christmas time again

Feed the world
Let them know it’s Christmas time again

Feed the world
Let them know it’s Christmas time again

Feed the world
Let them know it’s Christmas time again
