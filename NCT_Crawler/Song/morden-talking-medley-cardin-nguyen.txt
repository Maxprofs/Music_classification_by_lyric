                        Bài hát : Morden Talking Medley - Cardin Nguyễn

Deep love is a burning fire
Stay, cause then the flames grow higher
Babe, don't let him steal your heart
It's easy, it's easy
Girl, this game can't last forever
Why? Why can't we live together
Try, don't let him take your love from me
You're not good, can't you see brother Louie, Louie, Louie
I'm in love set you free
Oh, she's only looking to me
Only love breaks her heart brother Louie, Louie, Louie
Only love's paradise
Oh, she's only looking to me
Brother Louie, Louie, Louie
Oh, she's only looking to me
Oh, let it Louie
She's undercover
Brother Louie, Louie, Louie
Oh, she's only looking to me
So, leave it Louie
'Cause I'm her lover
Cheri cheri lady
Going through a motion
Love is where you find it
Listen to your heart
Cheri cheri lady
Living in devotion
It's always like the first time
Let me take a part
Cheri cheri lady
Like there's no tomorrow
Take my heart - don't lose it
Listen to your heart
Cheri, cheri lady
To know you is to love you
If you call me baby I'll be always yours
Deep in my heart - there's a fire - a burning heart
Deep in my heart - there's desire - for a start
I'm dying in emotion
It's my world in fantasy
I'm living in my, living in my dreams
You're my heart, you're my soul
I'll keep it shining everywhere I go
You're my heart, you're my soul
I'll be holding you forever
Stay with you together
You're my heart, you're my soul
Yeah, I'm feeling that our love will grow
You're my heart, you're my soul
That's the only thing I really know
You can win if you want
If you want it, you will win
On your way you will see that life is more than fantasy
Take my hand, follow me
Oh, you've got a brand new friend for your life
You can win if you want
If you want it you will win
Oh, come on, take a chance for a brand new wild romance
Take my hand for the night
And your feelings will be right, hold me tight
                        
                    |
