                        Bài hát: Black Or White (Single Version) - Michael Jackson

I took my baby
On a Saturday Bang
Boy, is that girl with you?
Yes we're one and the same

Now I believe in miracles
And a miracle
Has happened tonight

But, if
You're thinkin' about my baby
It don't matter if you're
Black or white

They print my message
In the 'Saturday Sun'
I had to tell them
I ain't second to none

And I told about equality
An' it's true
Either you're wrong
Or you're right

But, if
You're thinkin' about my baby
It don't matter if you're
Black or white

Don't depend

I am tired of this Devil
I am tired of this stuff
I am tired of this business
Goin' when they going to gets rough
I ain't scared of your brother
I ain't scared of no sheets
I ain't scare of nobody
Girl when the goin' gets mean

Protection
For gangs, clubs and nations
Causing grief in human relations
It's a turf war on a global scale
I'd rather hear both sides of the tale
See, it's not about races, just places, faces
Where your blood comes from
Is where your space is
I've seen the light get duller
I'm not going to spend
My life being a color

Don't tell me you agree with me
When I saw you
Kicking dirt in my eye

But, if
You're thinkin' about my baby
It don't matter if you're
Black or white

I said if
You're thinkin' of bein' my baby
It don't matter if you're
Black or white

I said if
You're thinkin' of being my brother
It don't matter if you're
Black or white

No, no, alright
Alright
Yeah, yeah, yeah now
Alright, alright
Jump on, don't
Yeah, yeah, yeah now
Alright

It's black, it's white
It's tough for you to get by
It's black, it's white
It's black, it's white
It's tough for you to get by
It's black, it's white
                        
                    |
