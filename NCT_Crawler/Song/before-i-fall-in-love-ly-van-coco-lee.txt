                        [VERSE 1]
My heart says we've got something real
Can I trust the way I feel
'Cause my heart's been fooled before
Am I just seeing what I want to see
Or is it true, could you really be

[CHORUS]
Someone to have and hold
With my heart and soul
I need to know, before I fall in love
Someone who'll stay around
Through all my ups and downs
Please tell me now, before I fall in love

[VERSE 2]
I'm at the point of on return
So afraid of getting burned
But I want to take a change
Oh please, give me a reason to believe
Say, that you're the one, that you'll always be

[CHORUS 2]
It's been so hard for me to give my heart away
But I would give my everything ,
Just to hear you say (you're)
                        
                    |
