                        Don't panic, nigga don't panic
 Don't panic, nigga don't panic Shawty fell in love with a hustler
 Man I took her from a buster
 Niggas keep talkin' like they know something
 I slide on your bitch like she hol' something
 Don't panic, don't panic
 We just getting started nigga don't panic
 Real niggas getting cake
 Watch the fake niggas hate
 Don't panic, don't panic
 We just getting started nigga don't panic
 Don't panic, don't panic
 We just getting started nigga don't panic Talking fish scale got the whole salmon
 See you *** niggas from four planets
 Just getting started nigga don't panic
 If you a star, I'm a whole planet
 Acting like she won't get it
 Have her run through the team like Jerome Bettis
 You don't want it, don't look for it
 Have your bitch on a surfboard, surfboard, surfboard
 If you want this money, gotta work for it
 Puff puff pass, what you lookin' at?
 Bust it wide open, make it nasty Shawty fell in love with a hustler
 Man I took her from a buster
 Niggas keep talkin' like they know something
 I slide on your bitch like she hol' something
 Don't panic, don't panic
 We just getting started nigga don't panic

 Watch the fake niggas hate
 Don't panic, don't panic
 We just getting started nigga don't panic
 Don't panic, don't panic
 We just getting started nigga don't panic I won't let up, sippin' that Ciroc amaretto
 Real bitches gon' wait on 'em, fake bitches gon' skate on 'em
 Real bitches getting cake, fake bitches gon' hate
 She a model on the Gram
 Getting swallowed was the plan
 This young thug need four bitches
 Take her to the crib take no pictures
 Ass fat, let me get up on it
 Bounce back early in the morning Shawty fell in love with a hustler
 Man I took her from a buster
 Niggas keep talkin' like they know something
 I slide on your bitch like she hol' something
