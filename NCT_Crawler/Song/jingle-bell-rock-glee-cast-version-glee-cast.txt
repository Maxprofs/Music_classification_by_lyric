                        Bài hát: Jingle Bell Rock (Glee Cast Version) - Glee Cast

Sam:
Jingle bell, jingle bell, jingle bell rock
Jingle bells swing and jingle bells ring
Snowing and blowing up bushels of fun
Now the jingle hop has begun

Jingle bell, jingle bell, jingle bell rock
Jingle bells chime in jingle bell time
Dancing and prancing in Jingle Bell Square
In the frosty air.

What a bright time, it's the right time
To rock the night away
Jingle bell time is a swell time
To go gliding in a one-horse sleigh

Giddy-up jingle horse, pick up your feet
Jingle around the clock
Mix and a-mingle in the jingling feet

Sam with The Cheerios:
That's the jingle bell rock

The Cheerios:
Jingle bell, jingle bell, jingle bell rock
Jingle bells chime in jingle bell time
Dancing and prancing in Jingle Bell Square
In the frosty air.

Sam with The Cheerios:
Jingle bell, jingle bell, jingle bell rock
Jingle bells chime in jingle bell time
Snowing and blowing up bushels of fun
Now the jingle hop has begun

Sam:
Jingle bell, jingle bell, jingle bell rock
Jingle bells chime in jingle bell time
Dancing and prancing in Jingle Bell Square
In the frosty air.

Sam (The Cheerios):
What a bright time, it's the right time
To rock the night away (Rock the night away)
Jingle bell time is a swell time
To go gliding in a one-horse sleigh
Giddy-up jingle horse, pick up your feet
Jingle around the clock

Sam with The Cheerios:
Mix and a-mingle in the jingling feet
That's the jingle bell,
That's the jingle bell,
That's the jingle bell (Sam: rock)

The Cheerios:
Jingle bell, jingle bell, jingle bell rock

Sam with The Cheerios:
Jingle bell, jingle bell, jingle bell rock,
Jingle bell, jingle bell, jingle bell rock.

Sam:
Woah
                        
                    |
