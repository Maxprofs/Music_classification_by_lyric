rescue me from the mire
whisper words of desire
rescue me darling rescue me
with your arms open wide
want you here by my siede
come to me darling rescue me
when this world s closing in
there s no need to pretend
set me free darling rescue me
I don t manna let you go
so i m standing in your way
I never needed anyone like
I need you today
do I have do say the words
do I have to tell the true
do I have to shout it out
do I have to say the prayer
must I prove to you how good we are together
do I have to say the words
rescue me from despair
tell me you will be there
help me please darling rescue me
every dream that we share
every crass that we bear
can t you see darling rescue me
I don t manna let you go
so i m standing in your way
I never needed anyone like
I need you today
do I have do say the words
do I have to tell the true
do I have to shout it out
do I have to say the prayer
must I prove to you how good we are together
do I have to say the words
do I have to say the words
do I have to tell the true
do I have to shout it out
do I have to say the prayer
must I prove to you how good we are together
do I have do say the words
