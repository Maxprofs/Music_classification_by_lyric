                        Bài hát: I Will Always Love You - Whitney Houston

If I should stay
I would only be in your way
So I'll go 
But I know
I'll think of you every step of the way

And i will always love you...Ahhh
Will always love you 
You, My Darling you...(mmm..)

Bitter sweet memories
That is all I'm taking with me
So, goodbye. Please don't cry
I'm not what you, you need

And I will always love you
I Will always love you...

I hope life treats you kind
And I hope you have all you dreamed of 
And I'm wishing you joy and happiness
But above all this - I wish you love 

And I will always love you.. 
I Will always love you 
I Will always love you 
I Will always love you 
I Will always love you 
I Will
I Will always love you
Darling I love you
Ooh, I'll always
I'll always love youuu..
