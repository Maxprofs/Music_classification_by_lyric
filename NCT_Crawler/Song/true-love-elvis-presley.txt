                        Suntanned, windblown
 Honeymooners at last alone
 Feeling far above par
 Oh, how lucky we are While I give to you and you give to me
 True love, true love
 So, on and on it will always be
 True love, true love For you and I
 Have a Guardian Angel on high with nothing to do
 But to give to you and to give to me
 Love forever true, love forever true
                        
                    |
