                        Bài hát: Not Gonna Die - Skillet

Death...Surrounds...!
My heart beat slowing down 
i won't take this world's abuse
i won't give up i refuse!
this is how it feels bent and broken
This is how it feels when your dignity is stolen
When everything you love is leaving 
You hold on to what you believe in
...................................
the last thing i heave
was you whispering goodbye
and then i heave you flat line
.........................

No...Not gonna die tonight 
we're gonna stand and fight forever
......
Don't close your eyes
..............
No....Not gonna die tonight 
we're goonna fight for us together
No we're not gonna die tonight....

Break their hold
cause i won't be controlled
they can't keep their chains on me
When the truth has set me free
This is how it feels when you take your life back
This is how it feels when you finally fight back
When life pushes me i push harder
What doesn't kill me makes me stronger 
.......................
the last thing i heave
was you whispering goodbye
and then i heave you flat line
.............................
No....Not gonna die tonight 
we're gonna stand and fight forever
............................
Don't close your eyes
.........................
No....Not gonna die tonight 
we're goonna fight for us together
No we're not gonna die tonight....
.........................
Don't you give up on me, You're everything i need....!!

This is how it feels when you take your life back
This is how it feels when you fight back !
.........................
No....Not gonna die tonight 
we're gonna stand and fight forever
............................
Don't close your eyes
.........................
No....Not gonna die tonight 
we're goonna fight for us together
No we're not gonna die tonight....
No we're not gonna die tonight....
Not gonna die
(Not gonna die )
Not gonna die 
(Not gonna die )
Not gonna die tonight...!!!
