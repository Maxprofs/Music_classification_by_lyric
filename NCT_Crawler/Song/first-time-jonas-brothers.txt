                        Such a thrill, of a lifetime
What a night, for a good time
The beat, be your lifeline
Make it feel, like the first time

Oh-oo Oh Oh-oo Oh Oh
Make it feel like the first time
Oh-oo Oh Oh-oo Oh Oh
Make it feel like the first time
Come on let it set you free
Right here right now where you're suppose to be
Oh-oo Oh Oh-oo Oh Oh
Make it feel like the first time

So lets toast, to the good life (good life)
Yeah-e Yeah
What it felt to free your mind (free your mind)
Let the beat (Let the Beat), be your lifeline (lifeline)
Make it feel (Make it feel), like the first time (first time)

Oh-oo Oh Oh-oo Oh Oh
Make it feel like the first time
Oh-oo Oh Oh-oo Oh Oh
Make it feel like the first time
Come on let it set you free
Right here right now where we're suppose to be
Oh-oo Oh Oh-oo Oh Oh
Make it feel like the first time

Let your heart control your mind
Make it feel, like the first time

Oh-oo Oh Oh-oo Oh Oh
Make it feel like the first time
Oh-oo Oh Oh-oo Oh Oh
Make it feel like the first time
Come on let it set you free
Right here, right now we suppose to be
Oh-oo Oh Oh-oo Oh Oh
Make it feel like the first time
