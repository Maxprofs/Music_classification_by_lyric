                        Well I was there on the day they sold the cars for the queen
And when the lights all went out, we watched our lives on the screen
I hate the ending myself, but it started with an alright scene

It was the roar of the crowd that gave me heartache to sing
It was alive when they smiled and said, "you won't feel a thing"
And as we ran from the cops we laughed so hard it would sting

Yeah yeah, oh

If i'm so wrong (so wrong, so wrong) how can you listen all night long? (night long, night long)
And will it matter after i'm gone? because you never learned a god damned thing

You're just a sad song with nothing to say about a life long wait for a hospital stay
Well if you think that i'm wrong, this never meant nothing to you

I spent my high school career spit on and shoved to agree
So I could watch all my heroes sell a car on tv
We've got the obvious scene, we'll show 'em what we all mean

Yeah yeah, oh

If i'm so wrong (so wrong, so wrong) how can you listen all night long? (night long, night long)
Now will it matter long after i'm gone because you never learned a god damned thing

You're just a sad song with nothing to say about a life long wait for a hospital stay
Well if you think that i'm wrong, this never meant nothing to you

So, go, go, just go, run away.
Now where did you run to? and where did you hide?
Go find another way...

Woah oh, woah oh...

You're just a sad song with nothing to say about a life long wait for a hospital stay
And if you think that i'm wrong, this never meant nothing to you, come on

You're just a sad song with nothing to say about a life long wait for a hospital stay
And if you think that i'm wrong, this never meant nothing to you

At all, at all...
