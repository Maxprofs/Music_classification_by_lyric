When you're feeling sad and low
We will take you where you gotta go
Smiling, dancing, everything is free
All you need is positivity
Colours of the world (Spice up your life!)
Every boy and every girl (Spice up your life!)
People of the world (Spice up your life!)
Aah...
Slam it to the left (if you're having a good time)
Shake it to the right (if you know that you feel fine)
Chicas to the front (huh huh) and go round
Slam it to the left (if you're having a good time)
Shake it to the right (if you know that you feel fine)
Chicas to the front (huh huh)
Hi, see ya, hold tight!
La la la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la
Yellow men in Timbuktu
Colour for both me and you
Kung-Fu fighting, Dancin' Queen
Tribal spaceman and all that's in between
Colours of the world (Spice up your life!)
Every boy and every girl (Spice up your life!)
People of the world (Spice up your life!)
Aah...
Slam it to the left (if you're having a good time)
Shake it to the right (if you know that you feel fine)
Chicas to the front (huh huh) and go round
Slam it to the left (if you're having a good time)
Shake it to the right (if you know that you feel fine)
Chicas to the front (huh huh)
Hi, see ya, hold tight!

Flamenco, Lambada, but hip-hop is harder
We moonwalk the Foxtrot, then Polka the Salsa
Shake it shake it shake it, haka!
Shake it shake it shake it, haka!
Arriba!
