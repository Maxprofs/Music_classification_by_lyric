                        Will you still need me if
you find your dreams
will you still love me if
I see you free
when i'm away from you
will you miss me
just tell me will you still

Girl, you know how much we've been through
can't image my life without you
but when you're not around 
I can feel the pain
let me know what's on your mind
let me know if I'm wasting my time
the thoughts I've having here are driving me insane
girls, I'm trembling my happiness
just one touch and I'm at your command
took for granted what you mean to me
so tell me how you feel

will you still need me if 
you find your dreams
will you still love me if
I set you free
when i'm away from you
will you miss me
just tell me will you still

you'll never find one's that better
who can love you like i do
i only wish you could understand me, girl
you say there is nothing wrong
when everything here is all gone
now that I've hand enough
how's it gonna be?
so many nights I've waited for you
thinking if you ever coming home
now i'm wondering if you'll be there for me
so tell me how you feel.
