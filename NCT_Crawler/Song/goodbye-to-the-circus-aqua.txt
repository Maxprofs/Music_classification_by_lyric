                        It's time now to turn off the light
 This has been such a beautiful night
 We have served you a lot of delights
 And some really wonderful sights My friend, this is the end
 So long and see you soon again
 Bye bye, kissing you hi
 Someday we will be back together Goodbye to the circus
 We hope you enjoyed the show
 Now it's nearly at the end
 But it will be back, you know
 It will be back, you know
 It will be back, you know You have given us all of the best
 You are beating inside our chest
 Stayin' with us as time has gone by
 Gave us hope when the tide was high My friend, this is the end
 So long and see you soon again
 Bye bye, kissing you hi
 Someday we will be back together Goodbye to the circus
 We hope you enjoyed the show
 Now it's nearly at the end
 But it will be back, you know The band played on, from dusk till dawn
 And time is almost gone
 The beat goes on, it's almost done
 This music marathon It will be back, you know
 It will be back, you know So, goodbye to the circus
 We hope you enjoyed the show
 Now it's nearly at the end
 But it will be back, you know So, goodbye to the circus
 We hope you enjoyed the show
 Now it's nearly at the end
 But it will be back, you know
 We will be back, you know
 We will be back, you know
