Tell You Something
Alicia Keys

Get so caught up everyday
tryin to keep it all together
while the time just slips away
see i know nothing lasts forever
Imagine there was no tomorrow
imagine that i couldn't see your face
there'd be no limit to my sorrow
so all i can say

i wanna tell you something
give you something
show you in so many ways
cuz it would all mean nothing
if i don't say something
before it all goes away
don't wanna wait to bring you flowers
waste another hour
let alone another day
i'm gonna tell you something
show you something
won't wait til it's too late

i can't wait, i can't wait, i won't wait, i don't wanna wait
i can't wait, i can't wait, i won't wait, i don't wanna wait
i won't wait til it's too late

just a simple conversation (..sation)
just a moment is all it takes (yeah)
i wanna be there just to listen
(i wanna be here)
and i don't wanna hesitate (oh no)

imagine there was no tomorrow (imagine)
imagine that i couldn't see your face (your face)
there'd be no limit to my sorrow (oh no)
cuz there is nothing that can fill this space

i don't wanna put it off for too long
i didn't say all that i had to say
i wanna take the time to right the wrongs
before we get to that place

i wanna tell you something
give you something
show you in so many ways

cuz it would all mean nothing
if i don't say something
before it all goes away
don't wanna wait to bring you flowers
waste another hour
let alone another day
i'm gonna tell you something
show you something
won't wait til it's too late

just lean on my shoulder
it's not over til it's over
don't worry boy
cuz i'm gonna make sure
i'm gonna get stronger yeah

i don't wanna wait until the storm
and somethings wrong
and now you're gone
and i can't find ya

i wanna tell you something
give you something
show you in so many ways
cuz it would all mean nothing
if i don't say something
before it all goes away
don't wanna wait to bring you flowers
waste another hour
let alone another day
i'm gonna tell you something
show you something
won't wait til it's too late

i wanna tell you something
give you something
show you in so many ways
cuz it would all mean nothing
if i don't say something
before it all goes away
don't wanna wait to bring you flowers
waste another hour
let alone another day
i'm gonna tell you something
show you something
won't wait til it's too late

i can't wait, i can't wait, i won't wait, i don't wanna wait
(i won't wait til it's too late)
i can't wait, i can't wait, i won't wait, i don't wanna wait
(no.. won't wait, no no)
i can't wait, i can't wait, i won't wait, i don't wanna wait
(i won't late til it's too late)
i can't wait, i can't wait, i won't wait, i don't wanna wait
no no no no no
no no
(i can't wait, i won't wait)
