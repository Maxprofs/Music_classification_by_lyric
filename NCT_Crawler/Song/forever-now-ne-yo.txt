                        Was gonna give you these flowers tonight
Was gonna ask you to stay
Practiced so that I would say it just right
But now there are no words to say.

As I watch you kiss him softly the same way you kissed me
I scream what am I gonna do with forever now?
tell me what am I gonna do with forever now?
All the plans we’ve made don’t work if you’re not around
So tell me what am I gonna do with forever now?
What do I do now?

What do I do now?

In slow motion I let these flowers hit the ground
and right before I turn to leave
I watch you kiss him softy then look up and see me

Chorus:
And I scream what am I gonna do with forever now?
tell me what am I gonna do with forever now?
All the plans we’ve made don’t work if you’re not around
So tell me what am I gonna do with forever now?
What do I do now?

Everything you said we would be
all the things you said we do
I will run my life around the thought of me and you

Chorus:
And I scream what am I gonna do with forever now?
(what do I do, what do I do?)
tell me what am I gonna do with forever now?
(what do I do, what do I do?)
All the plans we’ve made don’t work if you’re not around
So tell me what am I gonna do with forever now?
What do I do now?

What do I do now?
What do I do now?

What do I do, what do I do now?
What do I do now?
What do I do, what do I do now?
                        
                    |
