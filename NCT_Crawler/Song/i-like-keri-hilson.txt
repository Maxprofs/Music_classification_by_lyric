                        Sun down, Friday night, uptown city lights
Here I go, start it out
I like

Dressed up, out the door
So damn ready for one night, maybe more
I like, I like

Red strobe light, hot coarse dirty minds
When you cross my way
I like, I like
Just you and I, touch at first sight

And the world around us won't stop turning to night
I like, I like
I'm losing control right now, and I feel it's right
I like, I like

We're caught in this moment, I won't let you go
And the world around us won't stop turning to night
I like, I like
I like, I like

Hey there, pure star, let's go way too far
Come a little closer
I like

Heart beats up and down, we're dancing on sleezy ground
Betcha want to get it on
I like, I like

You've got me down right electrified
Don't stop the rides
I like I like

Just you and I, here and now what a night
I, I, I and the world around us won't stop turning to night
I like, I like
I'm losing control right now, and I feel it's right
I like, I like

We're caught in this moment, I won't let you go
And the world around us won't stop turning to night
I like, I like
I like, I like

Dance all night, don't stop the music
I like, I can't refuse it
Dance all night, don't stop the music
I like, I can't refuse it

And the world around us won't stop turning to night
I like, I like
I'm losing control right now and I feel it's right
I like, I like

We're caught in this moment, I won't let you go
And the world around us won't stop turning to night
I like, I like
I like, I like

I like, I like
I like, I like
