[Verse 1]
I been thinking 'bout you, I wanna be your bae
Show me that you feel the same
I'm always dreaming of you, all the lonely days
I wanna hear you say my name

[Chorus]
So what are, what are you
What are (what are) you waiting for?
So what are you, what are you
What (what) are you waiting for?
So what are you, what are you
What are (what are) you waiting for?
Babe, so what are you waiting for?
My love is your love
Your love is my love
My love is your love
Babe, so what are you waiting for?
Babe, so what are you waiting for?

[Verse 2]
I can't take my mind off you, i got you playing a game
We can find our perfect place
I'm here stuck to you, lets got a miles way
I wanna hear you say my name

[Chorus]
So what are, what are you
What are (what are) you waiting for?
So what are you, what are you
What (what) are you waiting for?
So what are you, what are you
What are (what are) you waiting for?
Babe, so what are you waiting for?
My love is your love
Your love is my love
My love is your love
Baby, so what are you waiting for?
Baby, so what are you waiting for?
