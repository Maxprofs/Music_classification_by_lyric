                        Bài hát: We Remain (The Hunger Games: Catching Fire Ost) - Christina Aguilera

All the ways that you think you know me
All the limits that you figure out, limits that you figure out
How to learn to keep it up or below me
Just to keep from being thrown around, just to keep from being thrown around

Every single time the wind blows
Every single time the wind blows
I see it in your face (Ohh)

In a cold night
There will be no fair fight
There will be no goodbye
To turn and walk away

To burn me with fire
To drown me with rain
I'm gonna wake up
Screaming your name

Yes I'm a sinner
Yes I'm a saint
Whatever happens here
Whatever happens here
We remain

Now we talk about a wasted future
But we take a good look around
Yeah we take a good look around

Yeah we know it, it hasn't been for nothing
'Cause we'll never let it slow us down
No we'll never let it slow us down
(Oh yeah)

Every single time the wind blows
Every single time the wind blows
I see it in your face (Ohh)

In a cold night
There will be no fair fight
There will be no goodbye
To turn and walk away

To burn me with fire
To drown me with rain
I'm gonna wake up
Screaming your name

Yes I'm a sinner
Yes I'm a saint
Whatever happens here
Whatever happens here
We remain

We remain, we remain

Burn me with fire
Drown me with rain
I'm gonna wake up
Screaming your name

Yes I'm a sinner
Yes I'm a saint
Whatever happens here
Whatever happens here
We remain
                        
                    |
