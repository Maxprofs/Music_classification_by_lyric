                        We’ve run out of words we’ve run out of time
We’ve run out of reasons, really why we together?
We both know it’s over baby bottom line
It’s best we don’t even talk at all

Don’t call me even if I should cross your mind
Hard enough, I don’t need to hear your voice on my messages
Let’s just call it quits it’s probably better so if I’m not returning your calls it’s cuz

Pre-Chorus:
Cuz I’m not coming back I’m closing the door
I used to be trippin’ over missin’ you but I’m not any more
I got the picture phone baby, your picture’s gone
Couldn’t stand to see your smile every time you dialed

Chorus:
Cuz it’s over girl you know it’s over this time
So when you call I’m pressin 7 don’t wanna hear your messages messages
I’m tryna erase you from my mind

Cuz it’s over I swear girl it’s over this time
So don’t keep callin’ leavin messages don’t wanna know where you been
Baby cuz it’s over

I still wake up every morning quarter to ten
Still eat my cereal right at the kitchen table
I can’t even remember how long it’s been
When your troubles stayed & occupied
Oh, ask about you whenever I come around
I do what I can not to put my business in the streets
Last thing I need is another episode keep conversations short and sweet because

Pre-Chorus:
Cuz I’m not coming back I’m closing the door
I used to be trippin’ over missin’ you but I’m not any more
I got the picture phone baby, your picture’s gone
Couldn’t stand to see your smile every time you dialed

Chorus:
Cuz it’s over girl you know it’s over this time
So when you call I’m pressin 7 don’t wanna hear your messages messages
I’m tryna erase you from my mind

Cuz it’s over I swear girl it’s over this time
So don’t keep callin’ leavin messages don’t wanna know where you been
Baby cuz it’s over

You know that it’s over when the burnin’ & the yearnin inside your heart ain’t there anymore
And you know that you’re through when she don’t do to you & move you like the way she moved you before
And you wanna pull her close, but your heart has froze you kiss her but her eyes don’t close
then she goes I love your heart forever and it hurts you but you know that it’s better

Second Chorus:
Girl you know it’s over
girl you know it’s over this time
So when you call I’m pressin 7 don’t wanna hear your messages messages
I’m tryna erase you from my mind
Cuz it’s over I swear girl it’s over this time
So don’t keep callin’ leavin messages don’t wanna know where you been
Baby cuz it’s over
Cuz it’s over girl you know it’s over this time
So when you call I’m pressin 7 don’t wanna hear your messages messages
I’m tryna erase you from my mind
Cuz it’s over I swear girl it’s over this time
So don’t be callin’ leavin messages don’t wanna know where you been
Baby cuz it’s over
