                        Bài hát: Money Power Glory - Lana Del Rey

You say that you wanna go to a land that's far away
How are we supposed to get there
With the way that we're living today?
You talks lot about God
Freedom comes from the call 
But that's not what his bitch wants
Not what I want at all
I want MONEY POWER GLORY
and I want your money and all your power, all your glory
Hallelujah
I wanna take you for all that you got
Hallelujah
I'm gonna take them for all that they got
The sun also rises 
on those who fail to call
My life, it comprises of losses and wins and fails and falls
I can do it if you really, really like that
I know what you really want, baby
I can do it if you think you like that
You should run, boy, run 
I want MONEY, POWER and GLORY
I want your money and all your power, all your glory
Hallelujah
I wanna take you for all that you got
Hallelujah
I'm gonna take them for all that they got

Dope and diamonds
Dope and diamonds
Diamonds
Dope and diamonds
Dope and diamonds
that's all that I want
Dope and diamonds
Dope and diamonds
Diamonds

I want MONEY, POWER AND GLORY
I want money, and all your power and all your glory
Hallelujah
I wanna take you for all that you got
Hallelujah
I'm gonna take them for all that they got
                        
                    |
