                        Bài hát: Man With A Mission - Emotions

Without the light in dark but I feel the deepest emotions 
Throughout the fight with mind I don't care about the lapse 
Believe your voice and smiles I'll be going there with my motion 
Blow out the feeling dead I don't care about the past.

Killing the emotion of mine and I just use my mind forget my life 
Apathy, impassivity and indifference of all the cautions to my life 
You were alive and said 
We're the ones who change the world we know by our hands 
You'd always saved, rescued and loved your neighbors as yourself 
Come and see just call my name 
Kodoku Ni Wakare O (孤独に別れを) - Đến lúc tạm biệt những ngày tháng cô đơn 
Te O Hiroge Takaku (手を広げ高く) - Giang cánh tay thật rộng và nhìn lên cao 
Sora E Sakebu (空へ叫ぶ) - Và hét thật tận trời xanh 
Without the light in dark but I feel the deepest emotions 
Throughout the fight with mind I don't care about the lapse 
Believe your voice and smiles I'll be going there to live 
Nothing but the emotions in motion.

Sailing the emotion of mine I go paint it black again and again 
Scared by all the things I face and the future 
that just leads to the white world's end 
But you just took my hand and you took me all above 
We're the ones who change the world 
close my eyes and urge myself to determine my faith 
Te O Hiroge Takaku (手を広げ高く) - Dang rộng đ6i tay và nhìn lên trời cao 
Sora E Tobudake (空へ飛ぶだけ) - Vút bay lên bầu trời kia 
Me O Toji Kokoro No (目を閉じ心の) - Nhắm mắt lại và mở rộng trái tim 
Koe O Sakebu (声を叫ぶ) - Hét thật to từ tận sau thẳm bên trong 
Without the light in dark but I feel the deepest emotions 
Throughout the fight with mind I don't care about the lapse 
Believe your voice and smiles I'll be going there to live 
Nothing but the emotions in motion.
