                        You don't need nobody
When your're down and so alone
And there's no telephone
No one calls you at your home, my baby
Oh tell me that you need me
And I'm sailing back to you
And I'm staying, yes it's true
For you I am the fool, you're my lady

Refrain:
Can't let you go, I need you so
Can't let you go, the time will show
Can't let you go, you break my heart for all the time
Can't let you go, I need you so
Can't let you go, the time will show
Can't let you go, you break my heart for all the time

Heaven will miss an angel
And I know you are the sun
But baby now you've gone
My heart it needs a home, oh baby
Oh tell me that you miss me
And I'm driving home to you
You broke the golden rules
For you I am the fool, you're my lady
Can't let you go, I need you so
Can't let you go, the time will show
Can't let you go, you break my heart for all the time
Can't let you go, I need you so
Can't let you go, the time will show
Can't let you go, you break my heart for all the time
                        
                    |
