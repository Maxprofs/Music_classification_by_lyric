                        Bài hát: Can't Take My Eyes Off You (Girls' Generation "Girls & Peace" Japan 2nd Tour Live) - SNSD

I love you baby, and if it's quite all right,
I need you baby to warm a lonely night.
I love you baby. Trust in me when I say
Oh pretty baby, don't bring me down I pray.
Oh pretty baby, now that I found you, stay.
And let me love you,baby
let me love you 

You're just too good to be true.
Can't take my eyes off you.
You'd be like heaven to touch.
I wanna hold you so much.
At long last love has arrived.
And I thank God I'm alive.
You're just too good to be true.
Can't take my eyes off you.

I love you baby, and if it's quite all right,
I need you baby to warm a lonely night.
I love you baby. Trust in me when I say
Oh pretty baby, don't bring me down I pray.
Oh pretty baby, now that I found you, stay.
And let me love you,baby
let me love you 

Pardon the way that I stare.
There's nothing else to compare.
The sight of you leaves me weak.
There are no words left to speak.
But if you feel like I feel.
Please let me know that it's real.
You're just too good to be true.
Can't take my eyes off you.

I love you baby, and if it's quite all right,
I need you baby to warm a lonely night.
I love you baby. Trust in me when I say
Oh pretty baby, don't bring me down I pray.
Oh pretty baby, now that I found you, stay.
And let me love you,baby
let me love you
