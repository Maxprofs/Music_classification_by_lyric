                        Bài hát: How Did I Fall In Love With You - Fiona Fung

What can I do to make you smile? 
I'm always here if you're thinking love 
The story of the tears from your eyes 

moshimo negaigoto ga hitotsu kanau nara 
shiawase kure ta kimi ni mouichido ai tai 

Can't you hear the voices of my heart? 
I was staying here just wanna see your happiness 

omoide mo himitsu mo kokoro ni shimau yo 
itsu no hi ni ka kimi to mata meguri ai tai 

.... 

Can't you hear the voices of my heart? 
I was staying here just wanna see your happiness 

omoide mo himitsu mo kokoro ni shimau yo 
itsu no hi ni ka kimi to mata meguri ai tai
                        
                    |
