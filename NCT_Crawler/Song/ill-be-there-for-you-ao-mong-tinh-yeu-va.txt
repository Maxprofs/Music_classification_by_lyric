                        Bài hát: I'll Be There For You (Ảo Mộng Tình Yêu) - V.A

How could someone like you be without love
How could someone let you in tear
How I long to hold you here in my arms
You are all that I want

I will do every thing I could for you
Baby now all your dream will come true
And then you'll never have to feel blue
Cause I'll always be there for you

I know that someone let your heart in pain
Someone let you feel lonely
But I'll be there when you need a hand
I'll be there when the sun comes shining blue

I know that some one let your heart in pain
Someone let you feel lonely 
But now you'll have me right inside your heart
And you never be alone again
                        
                    |
