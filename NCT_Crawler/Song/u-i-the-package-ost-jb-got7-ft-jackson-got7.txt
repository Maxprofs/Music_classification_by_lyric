Nal boneun ni nunbicci
Waenji aegyo neomchyeo boyeo
Neoui maltu hanahanaga nan neomu gwiyeowo
Gakkeum tultulgeoril ttaemada
Eorin ai gataboyeo
Nuneul ttel suga eopseo nuneul ttel suga eopseo

I just wanna stay
With you girl you glowing
Mwodeun neorang gati halge
Uri gati kkum kkumyeon dwae
I just wanna be
With you biccina boyeo
I’ll shine for you
Shine for me baby

You and I You and I You and I
Neorang hamkke hallae
You and I You and I
You and I You and I
Neorang gati geotgosipeo

Rm like an angel with no wings
God know what it is
And where it’s going
Yeah neoman bomyeon gibun joha
Danjeomeun neo ttaemune jami anwa

Erm byeol gateun neoui miso
Nan gireul ilheosseo allyeojwo
Ni maeumui juso
I’m not trying to convince
But I’ll wait by your side
Till you need somebody

I just wanna stay
With you girl you glowing
Mwodeun neorang gati halge
Uri gati kkum kkumyeon dwae
I just wanna be
With you biccina boyeo
I’ll shine for you
Shine for me baby

You and I You and I You and I
Neorang hamkke hallae

Neorang gati geotgosipeo
