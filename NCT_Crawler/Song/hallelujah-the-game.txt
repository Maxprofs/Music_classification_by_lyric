 Halle motherfucking lujah, all my real niggas I salute ya
 All the bad bitches, I'ma run throguh ya
 Hop in my holy ghost, hallelujah, down, down, down
 Hop in my holy ghost, hallelujah, down, down, down
 Heaven's prays, all I'm tryina do, reach you, praise you
 Heaven's prays, all I'm tryina do, reach you, praise you

 Nigga I ain't pastor mason yo, nigga patting rhyme, pete sirock acing y'all
 And since I got good taste and all, this for all the bad bitches couldn't wait to get they braces off
 I know we in church, and the way that I'm thinking, wrong
 But inside the bible is the perfect way to sleep my phone
 But I don't wanna do that, I came to take the service in
 And stare at all the women who brought they Louie purses in
 Bad bitches in here, forgive me for my sins
 I ain't meant to walk inside the church cursing again
 I wanna live righteous and you know I love Jesus
 But you can't catch the holy ghost in the prius

 Halle motherfucking lujah, all my real niggas I salute ya

 Hop in my holy ghost, hallelujah, down, down, down

 They look around the church like what that nigga looking here
 He prolly told of somebody, posed to be doing years
 But who am I to judge a nigga, hey I don't wanna go to church, I can't budge the nigga
 But I love the nigga, so I'ma go for both us, and put these g stars slacks with these louie loafers
 He rather sit outside and listen to hova
 But the service jumping, the past is serving my moses
 And all this ass in here, how do I focus
 Collection play... And they ain't passing you the coldest
 My envelope stay swollen, so I'ma count my blessings now, somebody hold this

 Staring in the row behind me, man these fat hoes is too cheap
 I ain't paying they ties, taking up 2 seats
 And look at god's house, pack full of sinner
 With the sun ride service, now they back for the dinners
 Yeah I know the chicken good but your soul ain't
 And your outfit clean but your nose ain't
 And I supposed ain't nobody a liar in here
 If that was true, the whole chruch would be on fire in here
 I'm so glad we have a choir in here, to wake me up everytime I get tired in here
 And one thing's for sure, gotta praise the lord
 Cause when I went to undefeated, they still have my force
 Fell to the floor like

 Hop in my holy ghost, hallelujah, down, down, down
 Hop in my holy ghost, hallelujah, down, down, down

 Heaven's prays, all I'm tryina do, reach you, praise you
