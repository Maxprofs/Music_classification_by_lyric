We've known each other
For a long long time
But I never really noticed
All the magic in your eyes
I've been around you
A thousand times before
And you've always been a friend to me
But now I'm wanting more
I must have been so blind
I never realized
You're the one that's right for me
All the while I couldn't see
And now I feel so strange
I'll never be the same
I'm going 'round and 'round in circles
And I don't konw what to do 'cause Baby
I've been thinking about you
In the most peculiar way
I've been thinking about you
It's unbelievable to me
But suddenly I think I'm falling in love
With you
There's no explaining
How I feel inside
I'm going through a transformation
That's so hard for me to hide
I had a revelation
That finally opened up my eyes
The one I spent a lifetime searching for
Was right here all the time
I was oblivious
So very out of touch
All the while I couldn't see
You're the one that's right for me
And now my world has changed
I'll never be the same
Going 'round and 'round in circles
And it
                        
                    |
