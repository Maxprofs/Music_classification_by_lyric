                        I'm nobody's baby, I wonder why
 Each night and day I pray the Lord up above
 Please send me down somebody to love
 But nobody wants me, I'm blue somehow
 Won't someone hear my plea and take a chance with me
 Because I'm nobody's baby now

 No, nobody's baby
 And I've got to know the reason why
 Last week I was walking down the street and met a boy and I said
 "Hey, maybe I was meant for you"
 But he only tipped his hat and shook his head
 Kept on walkin' down the avenue

 Oh, nobody wants me, I'm mighty blue somehow
 Won't someone hear my plea and take a little chance with me?

 Because I'm no-nobody's baby, I'm blue somehow
 Won't someone hear my plea and take a chance with me?
 There's no denyin' I'm cryin'
 I'm lonesome on my own-some
 I don't mean maybe, I'm nobody's baby!
