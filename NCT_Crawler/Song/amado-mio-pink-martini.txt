                        Amado mio
Love me forever
And let forever begin tonight

Amado mio
When we're together
I'm in a dream world
Of sweet delight

Many times I've whispered 
Amado mio
It was just a phrase
That I heard in plays
I was acting a part

But now when I whisper 
Amado mio
Can't you tell I care
By the feeling there
'Cause it comes from my heart

I want you ever
I love my darling
Wanting to hold you
And hold you tight

Amado mio
Love me forever
And let forever
Begin tonight

Many times I've whispered 
Amado mio
It was just a phrase
That I heard in plays
I was acting a part

But now when I whisper 
Amado mio
Can't you tell I care
By the feeling there
'Cause it comes from my heart

I want you ever
I love my darling
Wanting to hold you
And hold you tight

Amado mio
Love me forever
And let forever
Begin tonight
And let forever
Begin tonight
And let forever
Begin tonight
                        
                    |
