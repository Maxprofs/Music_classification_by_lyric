[DJ Khaled:] DJ Khaled

[Future, Takeoff & Offset:]
I got Patek on my arms (Phillipe!)
I got Patek on my arms (Phillipe!)
I put Patek on my arms (unique!)
I put Patek on my arms (woo!)
I put Patek on my arms (ah!)
I put Patek on my arms (woo! ice)
I had to ice out my arms (ice)
I done iced out my charms

[Migos:]
Bust it down, bust it down, bust it down
This is a hundred Patek, 20 more for Piguets
Boardin' a jet with a quart on my neck
Make her go board a plane with a brick on her breasts (hey!)
I shoulda played for the Mets (Mets)
OG two-tone my Patek (two-tone)
Makin' these bitches obsessed
Makin' these niggas grip TECs (ahh)
Flex on my ex (flex)
Like my man Khaled, say know we the best
She saw the Patek and got undressed for sex ('Tek)
Damn I'm so dranked that I saw a T-Rex
Unleashin' the beast and I beat on my chest
Ah, uh, step on the peds (step on the peds)
Patek on my flesh
Lambo wings, fly out the nest
We do not settle for less (who?)
I'm in the ghost with no head (ghost)
I'm thankin' the Lord 'cause I'm blessed
And some of my niggas, they dead (rest in peace)
Pockets on Gotti
We pull out the street in big body
Might pop a wheelie, Kawasaki
We make the profit and cop it
As soon as they drop it
Money fallin' out of my pocket (hey!)

[Future (Offset):]
I got Patek on my arms
I got Patek on my arms

I had to ice out my arms (Phillipe!)
I had to ice out my arms (Phillipe!)
Niggas gon' watch at the arms (unique!)
I put some ice on my arms (woo!)
I got Patek on my arms (ah!)
I got Patek on my arms (ice)
I had to ice out my arms (ice)
I done iced out my charms

[21 Savage:]
Ice, ice, woah, woah
I put VVS' in my Patek, who want static? (21)
Nigga don't touch my watch, it's gon' be tragic
Keep that bratchet (fire)
Tennis chains and tennis bracelets
Nigga like I play at Wimbledon (21)
Gang, gang, bitch
Y'all niggas actin' feminine
Gang, gang, bitch
We gon' pull up on your Sprinter and (21)
Ice on my neck and my arm, it's drippin' (ooh, drippin')
Saint Laurent sweater, lil' bitch this ain't no Coogi (yep)
Bitch you shop at JCPenney, you not bad and boujee (21)
Patek drippin', Hublot drippin'
And I got a bust down Rollie, cost 60 (21)
Audemars bust down cost 150 (21)
Hol' up, hol' up, hol' up, hol' up
I got keys, I got keys like Khaled (keys)
My bed Tempur-Pedic, I got an M in the mattress
Lil' bitch

[T.I.:]
Yeah, yeah
The Patek Phillipe sit right on my wrist
With a super bad bitch, eatin' right at Phillipe
Plus she fuckin' with a winner
Jury lookin' like a slushie
Fresh up out the blender
Maybe I hit her, maybe I didn't
Even if I did, I don't remember
Been a player since the very beginning
Stones in my charm, never my denim, no
Chain flooded like the livin' room
Incredible
Rappin', it was either that or sellin' dope
***, let the dice roll
Now diamonds all on top of diamonds, huh?
Drippin', gotta let you know I gotta go
Catch you anywhere, you get strong-armed
I'm talkin' upstream on a paddle boat
Okay one car, two shoes
You in hot water like a pack of noodles
Yeah, wife-beater, no tattoos
Like Wu-Tang, my cash rules, yeah
Brand new Richard Mille and it's tourbillion
'Bout to swap the Patek for the Vacheron (switch it!)

I had to ice out my arms (Phillipe!)
I had to ice out my arms (Phillipe!)
Niggas gon' watch at the arms (unique!)

I got Patek on my arms (ice)
I had to ice out my arms (ice)
I done iced out my charms

I had to ice out my arms
I done iced out my charms
