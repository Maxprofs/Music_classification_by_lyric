                        Bài hát: Stay With You - Avicii, Mike Posner

Ain't nobody gonna tell me ***
I'm still wrapped around your fingertip
and all my friends they love to call me whipped
but what they just don't know
Is I've looked in New York City
and I've looked in Boston too
I found a couple that were pretty
but I'm still gonna stay with you

Ain't nobody gonna tell me ***
I'm still wrapped around your fingertip
and all my friends they love to call me whipped
but what they just don't know.
Is I've looked in San Francisco
and I've looked all through LA
I've looked in Dallas, Texas
but something didn't feel the same.
So I looked in every city

I found a couple that were pretty
but I'm still gonna stay with you
Still gonna stay with you
