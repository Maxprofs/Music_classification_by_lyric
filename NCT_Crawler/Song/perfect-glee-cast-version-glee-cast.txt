                        Made a wrong turn, 
Once or twice, 
Dug my way out, 
Blood and fire 
Bad decisions, 
That's alright 
Welcome to my silly life.
Mistreated, misplaced, misunderstood, 
Miss "No way it's all good" 
It didn't slow me down. 
Mistaken, Always second guessing 
Underestimated, 
Look i'm still around.
Pretty pretty, please 
Don't you ever ever feel 
Like you're less than... Less than perfect. 
Pretty pretty please !
If you ever ever feel 
Like you're nothing 
You are perfect, To me.
You're so mean
 When you talk 
'Bout yourself, 
You are wrong. 
Change the voices, 
In your head, 
Make them like you, Instead.
So complicated 
Look how big you'll make it
Feel with so much hatred 
Such a tired game
It's enough ! 
I've done all i can think of 
Chase doown all my demons, 
And see you do the same.
Ohh, ohh !
Pretty pretty, please 
Don't you ever ever feel Like you're less than... *in perfect. 
Pretty pretty please ! If you ever ever feel Like you're nothing You are perfect...
The whole world scared, while i swallowed the fear. 
The only thing i should be drinkin'is an iced cold beer So cool in line, and we try try try, 
But we try too hard, it's a waste of my time. 
Done looking for the critics cause they're everywhere, 
They don't like my jeans, they don't get my hair. 
Exchange yourselves, and we do it all the time. 
Why do we do that ? Why do I do that ? Why do i do that ?
Yeahh ! Ohh ! Oh pretty pretty please !
Pretty pretty, please 
Don't you ever ever feel Like you're less than... Less than perfect. 
Pretty pretty please ! If you ever ever feel Like you're nothing You are perfect, to me !
You're perfect, you're perfect to me !
Pretty pretty, please 
Don't you ever ever feel Like you're nothing You are perfect, to me...
