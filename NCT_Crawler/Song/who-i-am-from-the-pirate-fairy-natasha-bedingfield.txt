                        Bài hát: Who I Am (From "The Pirate Fairy") - Natasha Bedingfield

I know i can reach the top of the world
Be all i am it is so beautiful
If only...
I could be brave, and i could be strong
I would know where i belong

If only...
I wanna feel free to be who i am
                        
                    |
