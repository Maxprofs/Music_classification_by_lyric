                        Verse 1
 Wait a minute, wait a minute
 I think I got to take some time and clear my mind
 Cause if I don't I might (scream)
 Scream out loud in a little bit
 I'm tell you what I'm talking about
 Ladies (ladies, ladies)
 If you know what I mean
 When you in love you give your everything
 (I'm tired of that happening)
 This time is for me
 You been doing you
 I'm goin' do me
 Ladies help me sing it

 Pre-Chorus
 You steady telling lies
 I stayed and pacified
 While I kept denying the truth
 You always here and there
 Finally I don't care
 I'm going to keep it real with you

 Chorus
 Ain't no feeling like being free
 When your mind's made up
 And your heart is in the right place, yeah
 Ain't no feeling like being free
 When you've done all you could
 But what's misunderstood (it's all good, it's all good)
 Ain't no feeling like being free
 I'm like an eagle set free
 And finally I'm looking out for me
 Ain't no feeling like being free
 Cause my mind's made up
 And my heart is in the right place, yeah

 Verse 2
 Hold 'em up, wait a second
 I got get something off my chest
 My happiness was your happiness, I lived and
 (Breathed) you and all your needs
 Let me speak, it's best I do what's best for me
 Now ladies, ladies (ladies)
 I got my mind back
 I've been there and done that (no looking back no)
 Oh, this time is for me
 If you been doing you
 I'm going to do me
 I'm free

 Pre-Chorus 2
 Time is of the essence
 And it's much too short to waste another
 Minute on you
 While you steady trying to hide
 I'm packing saying bye
 Thought you were my dream come true

 Chorus
 Bridge
 No it ain't easy being left out (no)
 Or being forgotten about (being forgotten about)
 You didn't deserve my love (my love)
 I've had enough set me free (free)

 Chorus
 Verse 3
 Can I get some loving (mmm)
 Can I get some time (mmm)
 Loving in morning ( yeah)
 And in the midnight hour (baby, baby)
 I gave you everything you wanted (wanted)
 I gave you everything you needed (mmm)
 But you just didn't do right so baby I'm leaving
 It feels so good to be free

 Chorus out
                        
                    |
