                        Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang
 Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang
 Do what the song says
 Throw your *** sets up
 Know how we start, come catch up
 Ain't nobody *** with this I bet yah
 And my age you should name on the check up
 Bang, while you wait, it all goes down
 Swipe through the city, that I call my town
 And if you *** up, damn right you a clown
 Ain't bangin high, don't make no sound
 Episodes of the violence bang
 Shots go hard, make your brain cells ring
 Floating with the stars in the city of the caine
 Let's ride out, throw it out and bang
 Bang, (all day) bang, bang (all day)
 Bang,Bang
 (What them mother***ers say?)
 Bang, (all day) bang, bang (all day)
 Bang,Bang
 Throw it out and bang
 Bang, (all day) bang, bang (all day)
 Bang,Bang,
 Let's ride out, throw it out and bang
 So, let's bang it out
 And we can bang it anywhere, even in my house
 But don't think so slick, if you think the opposite
 I'm gonna bang your lips
 When I say go, pop bang
 And I say high, throw up your thing
 Move to the beat, do the 2 step swing
 And if you don't dance, *** it go bang
 Chain gang, flip them man
 but at the parties slick'd insane
 Princess a ***, so bring my name
 Try to come near me, then *** go bang
 Living in chains like Menuse
 But I don't drunk off the *** called Goose
 Throw your *** sets up
 Rolling high with a star come catch up
                        
                    |
