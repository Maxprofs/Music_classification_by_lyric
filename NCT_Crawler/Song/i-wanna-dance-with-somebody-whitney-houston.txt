I Wanna Dance With Somebody
 :Whitney Houston

Clocks strikes upon the hour
And the sun begins to fade
Still enough time to figure out
How to chase my blues away
I've done alright up 'til now
It's the light of day that shows me how
And when the night falls loneliness calls

Oh! Wanna dance with somebody
I wanna feel the heat with somebody
Yeah! Wanna dance with somebody
With somebody who loves me

Oh! Wanna dance with somebody
I wanna feel the heat with somebody
Yeah! Wanna dance with somebody
With somebody who loves me

I've been in love and lost my senses
Spinning through the town
Soon or later the fever ends
And I wind up feeling down
I need a man who'll take a chance
On a love that burns hot enough to last
So when the night falls
My lonely heart calls
Oh! Wanna dance with somebody
I wanna feel the heat with somebody
Yeah! Wanna dance with somebody
With somebody who loves me
Oh! Wanna dance with somebody
I wanna feel the heat with somebody
Yeah! Wanna dance with somebody
With somebody who loves me

Somebody wu
Somebody wu
somebody who loves me
Somebody wu
Somebody wu
I need a man who'll take a chance
On a love that burns hot enough to last
So when the night falls
My lonely heart calls
Oh! Wanna dance with somebody
I wanna feel the heat with somebody
Yeah! Wanna dance with somebody
With somebody who loves me
Oh! Wanna dance with somebody

I wanna feel the heat with somebody
Yeah! Wanna dance with somebody
With somebody who loves me

Don’t you wanna dance with me baby
Don’t you wanna dance with me boy
Don’t you wanna dance with me baby

with somebody who loves me
don't you wanna dance say you wanna dance don't you wanna dance
don't you wanna dance say you wanna dance don't you wanna dance
don't you wanna dance say you wanna dance
uh-huh
with somebody who loves me
