                        Hold me close and hold me fast
 This magic spell you cast
 This is la vie en rose When you kiss me, heaven shys
 And though I close my eyes
 I see la vie en rose When you press me to your heart
 I'm in a world apart
 A world where roses bloom And when you speak
 Angels fly from above
 Everyday words seem to turn
 Into love songs Give your heart and soul to me
 Babe, it's gonna be
 La vie en rose When you press me to your heart
 I'm in a world apart
 A world where roses bloom And when you speak
 Angels fly from above
 Everyday words seem to turn
 Into love songs Give your heart, your soul to me
 Babe, it's gonna be
 La vie en rose
                        
                    |
