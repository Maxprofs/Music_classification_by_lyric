R&B/Hip Hop/Rap|

                        [Intro:]
 I see how these niggas playin'
 But I could adapt
 These niggas won't hold me back (x8)
 These hoes won't hold me back x 2
 These niggas won't hold me back x 2

 [Verse:]
 I look in my fridge, my *** lookin' scarce
 I got a few kids, we need some *** on the shelf
 I get a knock at the door, they say my rent overdue
 And while my niggas sell dope and don't know what else to do
 The only thing on my mind, I'm tryin' to keep on the lights
 I call up my slime, I need a kilo tonight
 Everything whipped well, I'm eatin' steak, no more soup
 And I parked the Capri, I went and bought me a Coup
 Everything takes time, but this *** came fast
 Niggas standin' in line, they wanna hold me back
 I multiplied my hustle, stimulated my mind
 Motivated my niggas and we'll never divide, no

 [Hook:]
 These niggas won't hold me back (x4)
 These hoes won't hold me back
 These hoes wanna hold me back (x3)
 No

 [Verse 2:]
 First I got me a Taurus, then I copped me a Lexus
 I took over Florida, my connect out of Texas
 Then I start sippin' purple, got myself screwed
 Where you feedin' your circle, watch your shipments improve
 Fabricate 'bout your fortune, all my fabric's imported
 Fornicate in my fortress, 40k still my mortgage
 24k my toilet, all my taxes reported
 All my exes deported, shout-out Texas, New Orleans
 All these niggas influenced by a hustler's endurance
 I just me the purest, but I need some insurance
 Niggas watch who you fuckin' just to hate on your bitches
 Niggas breakin' the rules, niggas facin' suspicion

 [Hook:]

 [Verse 3:]
 Momma workin' three jobs 'til I told her to quit
 How we rose from the sewers, funny now I'm the ***
 Niggas ain't gettin' money, but they got an opinion
 Had this tech makin' racket, serve you like you were tennis
 Killers ride for that paycheck, ak okay, check
 Bitch nigga let's play chess, yo bitch next, no latex
 These niggas won't hold me back, told the feds they sold me?
 Whip 'em right and then come right back
 Whip-whip-whip 'em right and then come right back

 [Hook:] x2

 [Verse 4]
 Pussy ass niggas, pussy ass niggas
 They all pussy ass niggas, pussy ass niggas
 Lookin' down on these niggas, pussy ass niggas
 Pushin' my new Ferrari on these pussy ass niggas
 Pussy ho, pussy ho
 She a pussy ho until she give me pussy ho
 Pussy ho, pussy ho
 Pussy ho, she a pussy ho

 [Hook:] x2
