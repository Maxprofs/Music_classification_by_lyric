                        Bài hát: Anybody's You - Christina Grimmie

Clearing off a table in my mind was set for two
Acting like it's nothing but I'm feeling like a fool
And something's gotta break before another one brings me down
They bring me down
Next on had me trusting every word I thought was true
How could you keep lying as she's lying next to you
And something's gotta break before another one brings me down
They bring me down

[Chorus:]
But what if there's something that I keep missing
What if there's someone that I can't lose
Night when I'm crying, will he listen
Isn't there anybody (anybody)?
What if there's someone that makes me happy
Someone that I already knew
What if, what it, what if that anybody?
Anybody's you
Any, anybody's you

Chasing after trouble with the one I wouldn't keep
One of many wasting time falling at his feet
Feels good going up but then it crashes hard when it brings me down
They bring me down
I'm getting tired, tired of looking everywhere for somebody like you
I'm just tired, tired, and it brings me down
They bring me down

[Chorus]

Anybody's you
Someone to listen
Someone to make me happy
Someone who loves me
What if that anybody's you
[x2]

[Chorus]

Any, anybody's you [x3]
                        
                    |
