                        Bài hát : More Than Me - Greyson Chance

I lost my way on streets that I paved
When I was deep in the blue
You were gone the whole time
You fall behind and I say goodbye
When you drive to drink, I numbed my mind

Gone are the times
We sipped on good wine
For the taste, yeah
Now you and I
We just drink what we find
Getting wasted

Your memory near
Laced with the pain
I needed love but it's never the same
For I wanted more
You wanted more than me

When the bottle is gone
In that silence I'll find
That life isn't nothing but chasin' the time
For I wanted more
You wanted more than me

Oh baby, since you lied I've had restless nights
Heard you got a brand new me
Guess you doin' fine

While you're getting through
All the things that you do, staying vacant
I drink what I find
Cause my angels on high, staying wasted

Your memory near
Laced with the pain
I needed love but it's never the same
For I wanted more
You wanted more than me

When the bottle is gone
In that darkness I'll find
That life isn't nothing but chasin' the time
For I wanted more
You wanted more than me

[x3]
The smoke got cleared
When the days turned to months
And the months turned years
For the anger to fade

When I took a step back
The realization came
You weren't looking at me
You were looking instead
Somewhere over my head
                        
                    |
