                        There'll be girls across the nation
 That will eat this up babe
 I know that it's your soul but could you bottle it up and
 Get down to the heart of it,
 No it's my heart you're *** out of your luck
 Don't make me tell you again my love love love love.
 Love love love love. I am aiming to be somebody this somebody trusts
 With her delicate soul
 I don't claim to know much except soon as you start
 To make room for the parts
 That aren't you it gets harder to bloom in a garden of
 Love love love love
 Love Love love love Only thing I ever could need, only one good thing
 Worth trying to be and it's Love, love
 Love, love
 I do it for love
 Love, love
 Love We can understand the sentiment you're saying to us
 Oh, but sensible sells so could you kindly shut up
 And get started
 At keeping your part of the bargain aw please
 Little darlin'
 You're killing me sweetly with love love love love
 Love love love love Only thing I ever could need only one good thing
 Worth trying to be And its love, love
 Love, love
 I do it for love
 Love, love
 Love Started as a flicker meant to be a flame
 Skin has gotten thicker but it burns the same
 Still a baby in a cradle got to take my first fall
 Baby's getting next to nowhere
 with her baack against the wall.
 You meant to make me happy make me sad.
 Want to make it better better so bad.
 But save your resolutions for your never new year
 There is only one solution I can see here. Love you're all I ever could need only one good thing
 Worth trying to be and it's
 Love, love
 Love, love
 I do it for love, love, love, love
 Oh, only gonna get, get what you give away,
 Love, love, love, love
