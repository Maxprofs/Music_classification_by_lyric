                        (VERSE 1)
I still hear your voice when you sleep next to me
I still feel your touch in my dream
Forgive me my weakness, but I don't know why
Without you it's hard to survive

(CHORUS)
'C ause everytime we touch, I get this feeling
And everytime we kiss I swear I could fly
Can't you feel my heart beat fast,
I want this to last
need you by my side
'Cause everytime we touch, I feel the static
And everytime we kiss I reach for the sky
Can't you hear my heart beat slow
I can't let you go
want you in my life

(VERSE 2)
Your arms are my castle
Your heart is my sky
They wipe away tears that I cry
The good and the bad times
We've been through them all
You make me rise when I fall

(CHORUS)
'Caus e everytime we touch, I get this feeling
And everytime we kiss I swear I could fly
Can't you feel my heart beat fast,
I want this to last
need you by my side

'Cause everytime we touch, I feel the static
And everytime we kiss I reach for the sky
Can't you hear my heart beat slow
I can't let you go
want you in my life
                        
                    |
