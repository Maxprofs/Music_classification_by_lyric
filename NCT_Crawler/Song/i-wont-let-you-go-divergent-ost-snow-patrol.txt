                        Bài hát: I Won't Let You Go (Divergent OST) - Snow Patrol

No one can ever follow
No one can ever know
Wind up the spinning top and watch it go, watch it go
Never gonna be easy, was it?
You didn't think it'd be so much fun
Smile comes despite the danger get some get some

There's something happening here
There's something here that I just can't explain
I know I'm where I belong
Deep down inside I am no longer lost!

I won't let you go
(This is what you really want)
So don't let go of me
(This is what you asked for)
I wanted something more
(This is what you really want)
I wanted this right here
(This is what you asked for)
                        
                    |
