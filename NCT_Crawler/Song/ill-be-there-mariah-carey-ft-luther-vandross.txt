Ooh, ooh
You and I must make a pact
We must bring salvation back
Where there is love, I'll be there
(I'll be there)

I'll reach out my hand to you
I'll have faith in all you do
Just call my name and I'll be there
(I'll be there)

Oh
I'll be there to comfort you
I'll build my world of dreams around you
I'm so glad I found you, yeah
I'll be there with a love so strong
I'll be your strength
You know I'll keep holding on

Let me fill your heart with joy and laughter
Togetherness, well it's all I'm after
Just call my name and I'll be there
(I'll be there)

Yeah, yeah
I'll be there to protect you
(Yeah baby)
With an unselfish love that respects you
Just call my name and I'll be there
(I'll be there)

Oh
I'll be there to comfort you
Build my world of dreams around ya
You know I'm so glad I found you baby
(So glad, baby)
I'll be there with a love so strong
I'll be your strength
(Be your strength)
You know I'll keep holding on

If you should ever find someone new
I know she'd better be good to you
'Cause if she doesn't, then I'll be there
(I'll be there)

Don't you know baby
Yeah, yeah
I'll be there, I'll be there yeah
Just call my name

And I'll be there
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

You know I'll be there
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

And I'll be there
Just look over your shoulder
Just call my name and I'll be there
Ooh, ooh
