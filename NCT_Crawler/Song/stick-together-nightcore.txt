                        Bài hát: Stick Together - Nightcore

You and I till the end 
Don’t need to pretend 
Again and again 
We’ll stick together 
Everything is alright 

With you by my side 
We won’t say goodbye 
We’ll stick together 
I can pick you up 
When your heading down 

When it all just sucks 
I’ll be your Charlie brown 
You can make me laugh 
When I wanna cry 

And the world gone mad 
We’re on an all time high 
And it wouldn’t be the same without you 
We have yet so many stupid things to do 

You’re the only thing I’m holding on to 
Anywhere and anything 
I’ll be there
                        
                    |
