                        Tell 'em that I need more
 Fire
 Tell 'em that we need more
 Tell 'em that I need more I woke up this morning, rolled a joint, then got to it
 Dealt with real life ***, manned up and got through it
 I'm a real D Boy, take a look up in my face
 Never did real estate, and still put you in your place
 I don't trust dog hos, dog hos got fleas
 From where they rock ski-masks and don't nobody ski
 Every time I spit a verse, my city like "Preach!"
 Niggas thought I got evicted how my *** up in the streets
 B-I-G Sean, ain't nothing obese, but the feast
 Swear I'm skinny cause I'm always on my feet
 Gotta hustle every second, stacking paper every week
 Boy I'm in the field for real, I might run up in some cleats
 Was in Japan so long, I almost learn to speak, had to leave
 Back to the hood, where they don't understand unless you speaking trapanese
 If I fall down, bet I only trampoline, bounce back
 Back on my feet, that's just how I be
 I be out of town reppin' valid as an absentee
 Lord G's, jealous mother***ers trying to absent me
 *** these niggas up, now it's absent teeth
 Trying to pass on me, when I'm first place in the playoffs bitch
 I'm even working half days on my day off bitch
 Say it's gon' kill me *** it, I work graveyard shifts
 'Long as that weed and money chilling in the pile
 Bitch I need that ***ing fire Fire
 Tell 'em that I need more
 Fire
 Tell 'em that we need more Right now, right now, right now
 I know it's been a long, long
 It's been a long, long time
 A long time, I know it's been a long, long time I woke up this morning, rolled a joint, then got to it
 Can do anything in the world except not do it
 Bought my fam new land, six star crib
 Momma feeling like she Jewish, I'm the mother***ing truest
 Yeah I talk about my mom, but shout out to my dad
 Would drive me to school every single chance he had
 Tell me 'bout the crazy girls and all about his past
 And gave me the talks that made me to a man
 Not everybody got a dad but they got a Uncle Sam
 And he ain't came around till I made a 100 grand
 Coming from Detroit where everybody say "whaddup doe?"
 Horror movie ***, cause everybody there cut throat
 Watch who you hustle with you might not get a cut though
 Even though you deserved a commission plus mo
 The grandma sad when she saw my commercial
 "Stop having people at your shows that wasn't at rehearsal's"
 I'm tryna to get a office at the Empire State
 To bring it back to empire's plate, that's home
 Man, I'm reppin' for my entire state
 Prayin' that I won't be late, when it's all finished at the endin'
 After all bottles spill it, throttle gripping, models switching
 Chin chilling in my villa, ***ing like I tryna populate a village
 I'm replenished, I didn't do it just for the money
 Man, for the feeling, I made it through the Fire
 Tell 'em that I need more
 Fire
 Tell 'em that we need more Right now, right now, right now
 I know it's been a long, long
 It's been a long, long time
 A long time, I know it's been a long, long time But it's never, never been too late
 It's never, never been too late
 It's never, never been too late
 It's never ever been too late
 Right now, right now
 I know it's been a long time
 I know it's been a long, long time
 Just know it's never, never been to late
 It's never, never been too late
 It's never ever been too late
 It's never ever been to late
 To do what you wanna do
 *** everything else
