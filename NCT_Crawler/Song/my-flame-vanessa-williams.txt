                        Ooh, how long?
 How long have you been away?
 (How long, babe?)
 Oh, how long?
 Cant find no words to say I've kept your picture on my shelf
 (Thinkin bout you, babe)
 Only there to remind myself
 (Thinkin bout you, babe)
 I have always cared for you
 Do you still love me? Oh my flame
 (My flame)
 Some things will never change
 Still hold your vision in my mind
 Say you still love me
 (Say that you love me, say that you love me) Oh my flame
 (My flame)
 Some things will never change
 Still hold your vision in my mind
 Say you still love me
 (Say that you love me)
 Say you still love me
 (My flame) Ooh, my love
 Will I ever make you see?
 (Incomprehensible)
 Oh that somehow, you are still a part of me
 Maybe we can compromise
 (Maybe, maybe)
 Cause our love just cant be disguised
 I have always cared for you
 (I care)
 Do you still love me? Oh, my flame
 (My flame)
 Some things will never change
 Still hold your vision in my mind
 Say you still love me
 (Say that you love me, say that you love me) Oh my flame
 (My flame)
 Some things will never change
 Still hold your vision in my mind
 Say you still love me
 (Say that you love me)
 Say you still love me
 (My flame, oh) I've kept your picture on my shelf
 Only there to remind myself
 (I'm thinkin bout you, babe)
 I have always cared for you
 Do you still love me? Oh my flame
 (My flame)
 Some things will never change
 (Some things will never change)
 Still hold your vision in my mind
 Say you still love me
 (Say that you love me, say that you love me) Oh my flame
 (My flame)
 Some things will never change
 Still hold your vision in my mind
 Say you still love me
 (Say that you love me, say that you love me) Say you still love me
 (My flame)
 Say you still love me
 (Say that you love me) Say you still love me
 (My flame)
 Say you still love me
 (Say that you love me)
 Say you still love me
