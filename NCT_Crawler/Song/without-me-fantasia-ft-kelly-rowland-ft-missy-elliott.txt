Fakin' *** will kill you,

 Fakin' *** will kill you,
 Boy I know the real you.
 Fakin' *** will kill you,

 Expose you for exactly what you are,

 And I'm feeling a little wavy,
 So right now I don't mind pulling your card. (Fakin' *** will kill you)
 Boy I know the real you
 Fakin' *** will kill you,
 Boy I know the real you. And as hard as you try,
 To hide reality, why?
 We know the truth,
 So act brand-new if you want to But what would you be
 Without me?
 What would you be
 Without me?
 So what? You blowing up just a little,
 They knowing you a little,
 Don't give a finger in the middle
 'Cause little nigga, you would never be
 Without me
 Where would you be
 Without me?
 So what you blowing up just a little,
 They knowing you a little,
 Don't give a finger in the middle,
 'Cause little nigga you would never be (oh na, na, oh na) Oh na, na, oh na
 Oh na, na, oh na
 Oh na, na, oh na You tell me that you make big moves
 But tell 'em what you really do
 Do you really wanna play this game? (Fakin' *** will kill you)
 Boy I know the real you.
 Fakin' *** will kill you,
 Boy I know the real you. You should tell 'em what you really like
 Tell 'em you ain't bout that life,
 I put you on, I let you shine,
 That use of light, *** blows my mind oh And as hard as you try,
 To hide reality, why?
 We know the truth,
 So act brand-new if you want to But what would you be
 Without me?

 They knowing you a little,
 Don't give a finger in the middle
 'Cause little nigga, you would never be

 They knowing you a little,
 Don't give a finger in the middle,
 'Cause little nigga you would never be (Oh na, na, oh na) Boy you think I'm stupid?
 What you think I'm clueless?
 You keeṗ chasing them girls
 Boy you get their deuces
 I'm sick of your excuses without me how can you do it?
 Do bad all by myself, nigga you're just useless
 Dude I don't need your sex (your sex)
