                        Now he walks in shadows
 He's tryin' to pretend, she never walked away now
 But it's not deceivin'
 He's closer to an end he never could foresee Where love goes, when love dies
 Heaven knows
 But it's more than meets the eye
 So much more than just a last goodbye
 It's a cold and lonely heart, so sad and torn apart
 Yes it's more than meets the eye, oh Now he's in for trouble, his luck has turned away
 Nobody seems to care, no
 Well there's a cold moon risin'
 And another lonely day has passed and she's not there Where love goes, when love dies
 Heaven knows
 But it's more than meets the eye
 So much more than just a last goodbye
 It's a cold and lonely heart, so sad and torn apart
 Yes it's more than meets the eye, sing it Oh yeah, uh uh
 Ooh, there's a cold moon risin'
 Ooh it's another lonely day
 It's more than meets the eye
 So much more than just a last goodbye
 It's a cold and lonely heart, so sad and torn apart
 Yes it's more than meets the eye, yeah So much more than just a last goodbye
 It's a cold and lonely heart, so sad and torn apart
 Yes it's more than meets the eye
