Westlife-Walk Away
Edited By JamesXu
Bryan:Here we are just a little longer
Time goes by
Why did I ever tell you why
I want you so much
You came to me when you were not around
You'll always be
The one to understand
That's why
I can't miss your touch

Shane:All my life
I waited for someone
And all this time
You were the one
So...

All:If you want a man that is here to stay
Swearing he's forever true
I'll never walk away
I'll never give up on you
And if you want a love that will save the day
No matter what you're going through
I'll never walk away
I'll never walk out on you

Nicky:I've been a fool
I didn't see behind the friend in you
But baby don't you ask me why
It just couldn't be love
Cos from the start
You would be the one to cure my heart
Well I just didnt look this way
Now I can't get enough

Bryan: All my life
I waited for someone
And all this time
You were the one
So...

All:If you want a man that is here to stay
Swearing he's forever true
I'll never walk away
I'll never give up on you
And if you want a love that will save the day
No matter what you're going through
I'll never walk away
I'll never walk out on you

Mark:And with a kiss you turned my world around
The greatest rush of all was to be found oh yeah
You changed my whole life
Colored up the dark skies
And this I promise you
Oh

All:If you want a man that is here to stay
Swearing he's forever true
I'll never walk away(never walk away)
I'll never give up on you(I'll never walk out on you)
And if you want a love that will save the day (saving the day)
No matter what you're going through
I'll never walk away(I'll never walk away)
I'll never walk, I'll never walk out on you
If you want a man that is here to stay
I'll never walk away (never walk away)
I'll never give up on you
And if you want a love that will save the day
No matter what you're going through
I'll never walk away(Walk away)
I'll never walk out on you
