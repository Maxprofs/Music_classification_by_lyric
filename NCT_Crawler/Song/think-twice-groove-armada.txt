                        Bài hát: Think Twice - Groove Armada

Close your eyes and lose the feeling that's been sinking
Close your eyes and count to three
Close your eyes rewind, I know just what you're thinking
Close your eyes and think of me 

Larger than life, niceties
Bigger than you, more than me
I've got the Monday morning blues
And oh my God I've got the home for you

And give the everyday morning you...use
There's things right here I can't afford to choose

Close your eyes and lose the feeling that's been sinking
Close your eyes and count to three
Close your eyes rewind, I know just what you're thinking
Close your eyes and think of me 

Sincere, caramel, champagne, down drain, tell him, no gain
It's so damn physical it will sustain
And too damn Technicolor to refrain
And much too taxing for my little brain

Why do we never know enough of happiness?
Why do they never show?
All the times we have been so good and caring
How many times we'll never know

Close your eyes and lose the feeling that's been sinking
Close your eyes and count to three
Close your eyes rewind, I know just what you're thinking
Close your eyes and think of me 

Close your eyes and lose the feeling that's been sinking
Close your eyes and count to three

Close your eyes rewind, I know just what you're thinking
Close your eyes and think of me 

Packed it like a punch out to lunch
I got a little hunch that stood out from the bunch
As if that's not a reason enough I need another reason why

God damn that bitch of life she made me cry
So I liked to poke her squarely in the eye
And it hurt so much I feel like I could die
Yeah
