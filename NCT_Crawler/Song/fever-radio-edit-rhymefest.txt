                        [Intro:]
 Neverrr know how much I love you (woo!)
 Neverrr know how much I care (No I. D.)
 And when you put your arms around me
 I get the fever that's so hard to bare
 You give me fever

 [Rhymefest]
 Uhh, here go that arrogant, stuffy head, cold leave you achin
 From asses ah-shakin all night to rest well medicine
 It's that {Fe-Ver} take two of these, call me in the mornin
 You gon' still feel sick, cause it's that {give you that fever}
 I give 'em all the plague, I'm awfully paid
 And still make a cold starve for days
 Never the type that ran, whatever the fight I'm in
 You half-hearted, but I take this medicine like a man
 For that {Fe-Ver} that keep these niggaz sweatin bullets
 Clack clack, naw them the ones that you caught for tryin to pull it
 This that {Fe-Ver} somebody warn the industry
 'Fest on fire, and burnin in the third degree
 'Til they murder me, five-oh get no words from me
 And if they do then that's perjury

 [Chorus:]
 {Fe-Ver} Hot like hot sauce
 Uhh, we got we got that fe-verrr
 Play women so false, flick your drawers off
 Fuh, fuh-fuh, we got that fe-verrr
 {Fe-Ver} Hot like hot sauce
 Uhh, we got we got that fe-verrr
 Play women so false, flick your drawers off
 Yeah we got, we got that fe-verrr

 [Rhymefest]
 Hmm, left the path to wipe sweat from his brow
 Except that his smile'll infect crowds
 Hot as Hades, I got a lot of ladies strippin down to they drawers
 Hittin the floor like owwww
 That's him, and by him I mean me
 By me, you seem weak homey like yo' heart pump green tea
 I stack greenbacks then lean back, scorchin hot
 My torch'll leave yo' ass charcoal black, I got that {Fe-Ver}
 You better listen to them old wives' tales
 I can look in yo' eyes, you high as hell for that {Fe-Ver}
 Rhymefest Peligrino, I quench thrist
 Niggaz better act like that bitch work
 I'm workin progress (the pimp's back) youse a work in progress
 You feelin the son/sun, respect my hotness
 So many fine chicks ***'s gettin monotonous
 But still I love the way that she shakes her maracas for that

 [Chorus:]

 [Rhymefest]
 Step in the club with my swagger, niggaz get bruised & then battered
 Grind mode is what I'm reppin and yep!
 Hot as the grease when it sizzle and pop in your eye
 Now you shrivel and chickens be gigglin like {give you that fever}
 Yeah homey, I makes that club turn to a sweatbox
 Like 50 horny Jamaicans with dreadlocks
 30 chicks in the lobby, probably 5 of 'em ready to party
 Cause I'm an ol' funny nigga like Redd Foxx
 But this is more than jokes, y'all niggaz sorta broke
 You can never be hot as me, you can't even afford a coat
 I got that {Fe-Ver} ha-ha-ha-hot as hellfire, brimstone
 Stiletto brim hats, bitches with gems on
 Niggaz with Timbs on, Jenny Jones to Jim Jones
 I get the d-down like syndrome
 I get are-round like rims on, the ghetto King Kong that sing songs
 And made a billion dollars on ringtones~!

 [Chorus:]

 [Outro:]
 Fe-Ver! Everybody's, got that fever, give you that fever
 Fe-Ver! Everybody's, got that fever
 Fe-Ver! Everybody's, got that fever, give you that fever
 Fe-Ver!
