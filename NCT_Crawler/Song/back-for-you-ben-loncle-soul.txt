                        I'm always coming back for you
 no matter what you put me through
 and though your parents hat-e me so
 I juste want you tu know
 I'll always bring it right here back to you I know you don't clean up the crib
 I wish you'd cook a little bit
 I stay out late you're throwing fits
 Always bring it back to you
 Sometimes I wonder why? I'm back for you
 I'm back for you
 I'm back for you
 I'm back for you I know you friends get on my nerves
 I'll still play scrabble with those nerds
 and even when you snore at night
 I'll be there to hold you tight
 Sometimes I wonder why? I'm back for you
 I'm back for you
 I'm back for you
 I'm back for you I don't know what happened to me
 But sometimes it's love whos choosing you
 I know u ain't the finest thang
 But I swear u the one girl
 I don't know why I'm so into you
 But I'll stand for your love
 and even with you wandering eye... I'm back for you
 I'm back for you
 I'm back for you
 I'm back for you
