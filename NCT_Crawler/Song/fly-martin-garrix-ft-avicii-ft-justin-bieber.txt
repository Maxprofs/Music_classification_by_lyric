                        Bài hát: Fly - Martin Garrix, Avicii, Justin Bieber

Cause I can fly, I can fly, I can fly
You craw around
Searching for higher ground
Can’t see in front of me my enemies
I tried every possibility bility
To know if I can bleed
If that’s what you wanted
You won’t get it tonight a a a ai
Cause I can fly, I can fly, I can fly, I can fly
Will you and I would
Falling down
You craw around
Searching for higher ground
Can’t see in front of me my enemies
I tried every possibility bility
To know if I can bleed
If that’s what you wanted
You won’t get it tonight
Cause I can fly, I can fly, I can fly
yea
I can fly
 Will you and I would
