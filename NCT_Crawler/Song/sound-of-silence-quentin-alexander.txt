                        Bài hát: Sound Of Silence - Quentin Alexander

 Hello darkness my old friends
I've come to talk with you again
Because a vision softly creeping
Left it seeds while i was sleeping 
And the vision that was planted 
In my brain, still remains 
Within the sound, of silence 

In restless dreams i walk alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone
Neath the halo of a street lamp
I turned my collar to the cold and damp
Where my eyes were stabbed 
By the flash of a neon light 
That split the night 
And touched the sound of silence
And in the naked light i saw

Ten thousand people maybe more
People talking without speaking
People hearing without listening
people writing songs
That voices never share
And no one dare 
Disturd the sound, of silence
Fools said i, you do not know 
Silence like a cancer grows 

Hear my words that i might, teach you
Take my arms that i might, reach you
But my words like silence raindrops fell
And echoed, in the well of silence 
And the people bowed and prayed
To the neon god they made 

And the sign flashed out it's warning
In the words that it was forming 
And the signs said: the words of the prophets are written on the subway walls 
And tenement halls 
And whisper'd in the sound of silence
                        
                    |
