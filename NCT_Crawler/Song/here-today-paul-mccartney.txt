                        And if I say I really knew you well
 What would your answer be?
 If you were here today
 Ooh ooh ooh, here today Well, knowing you
 Youd probably laugh and say
 That we were worlds apart
 If you were here today
 Ooh ooh ooh, here today But as for me, I still
 Remember how it was before
 And I am holding back the tears no more
 Ooh ooh ooh, I love you, ooh What about the time we met?
 Well, I suppose that you could say
 That we were playing hard to get
 Didn't understand a thing
 But we could always sing What about the night we cried?
 Because there wasn't any reason
 Left to keep it all inside
 Never understood a word
 But you were always there with a smile And if I say I really loved you
 And was glad you came along
 When you were here today
 Ooh ooh ooh, for you were in my song
 Ooh ooh ooh, here today
