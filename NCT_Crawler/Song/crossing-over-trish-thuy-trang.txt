                        Lalala lalala lalalalalala
(I'm crossing over to you) Lalala lalala lalalalala

There's a line that you can't see
But I know exactly where I standed
I'm afraid I'll go to far
And I'll have my heart within your hands

Searching so long 
And I've been hurt so many times
Feeling so strong
It's getting hard for me to hide

I'm crossing over to you 
And I just don't know what I should do
I get all so confused
I'm on the edge
 I'm crossing to you

Lalala lalala lalalalalala
(I'm crossing over to you) Lalala lalala lalalalalala

If I stay I'll never know
Look both ways and try to take it slow
I'm falling fast 
I lose control
And soon I'll past the point of no return

Crossing the line 
Between just friends or love of mine
Hold me tonight 
And lead me to the other side

I'm crossing over to you 
And I just don't know what I should do
I get all so confused 
I'm on the edge
 I'm crossing to you

Lalala lalala lalalalalala
(I'm crossing over to you) Lalala lalala lalalalalala

I'm crossing over to you(To you)
And I just don't know what I should do 
(Just don't know what I should do)
I get all so confused(Confused)
I'm on the edge
I'm crossing to you 

Lalala lalala lalalalalala
(I'm crossing over to you) Lalala lalala lalalalalala
