                        Stop, now let me see your booty drop If you think you impressin' us with your ice and your dub
 Poppin' bottles in the club, get your money up
 'Cause I ain't your average girl, I've been all around the world
 If you wanna wow me, then get your money up Get your money up, boy, get your money up
 I wanna see somethin' bigger than an armored truck
 Get your money up, boy, get your money up
 You gotta throw somethin' bigger than a hundred bucks Now slide, slide one of them Black Cards
 If you got it, then show me how you gettin' it
 Diamonds a girl's best friend, if you can provide them
 I might even act a fool while you're hittin' it When you see me and my dames blowin a whole lot of change at the bar
 Don't get jealous, get your money up
 And if you don't like us, there's nothin' to discuss
 We don't even give a ***, get your money up Get your money up, get your money up
 Stop playin' with yourself, get your money up
 Get your money up, get your money up
 Stop, now let me see your booty drop If you're tearin' the bar down with all the fly women
 And still livin' with your momma, get your money up
 Ridin' big whips, can't take care of your kids
 Why you lookin' at me? Get your money up When I'm up in the club, you know how we roll
 Them bottles pop, nonstop
 You up in Hollywood, you know how we roll
 Stop, now let me see your booty drop Cash is what I'm talkin' about, I don't wanna hear your mouth
 You need to put some money down, or get your money up
 Why you invadin' my space? Why you get up in my face?
 I ain't got nothin' to say but put your money up Get your money up, boy, get your money up
 Know you wanna see somethin' better than the MATA Bus
 Get your money up, boy, get your money up
 You know a bottle cost more than a hundred bucks Get your money up, get your money up
 Stop playin' with yourself, get your money up
 Get your money up, get your money up
 Stop, now let me see your booty drop Okay, now slide, slide one of them Black Cards
 If you got it, then show me how you gettin' it
 Diamonds a girl's best friend, if you can provide them
 I might even act a fool while you're hittin' it Now grind, grind, get you some big money
 And don't forget about me when you spendin' it
 But if you ain't gonna pay don't be screamin' out, "Hey, girl!"
 Stop, now let me see your booty drop Now slide, slide one of them Black Cards
 Make the Pacific Ocean be part of my backyard
 If you ain't gonna pay, don't be screamin' out, "Hey!"
 I'm an independent honey, I get money all day Now slide to your bank account, all the cash, throw it out
 If you ain't yellin' dollars and diamonds, I gotta walk it out
 Know what I'm talkin' 'bout? You steppin' to the baddest
 Got millionaires standin' in line wishin' they had this Take me to Paris, buy a lotta carats
 Christian Louboutin boots, bags, and more carats
 You want average, well, this the wrong section
 My girls need the check, so we headin' in their direction Get your money up, get your money up
 Stop playin' with yourself, get your money up
 Get your money up, get your money up
 Stop, now let me see your booty drop I know that's right, Keri, your girl KC, and Trina
 They gonna hate on this one right here, let's go
 Now get your money up, get your money up
 Get your money up, we don't like them broke boys
 We don't like them broke boys
