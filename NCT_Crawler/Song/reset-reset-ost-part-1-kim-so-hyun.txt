There’s an empty world deep in my heart, save me
I wanna reset , I wanna reset , I wanna reset
Lonely eyes trapped in darkness
Is there anyone to hold my hand?
I wanna reset , I wanna reset , I wanna reset

Someone somewhere will know my miserable heart
It’s right in front of me but I can’t find it like a oriole bird
I’m flying around by myself in this darkness, in my lonely night
I’m flying around by myself in this darkness, with a miserable heart
Why don’t you know? Even if I’m a small existence
Don’t trample on me but go with me
Your careless words and actions break me down
It corners me, though you deny it
I’m hiding behind the ridicule, don’t look for me

There’s an empty world deep in my heart, save me
I wanna reset , I wanna reset , I wanna reset
Lonely eyes trapped in darkness
Is there anyone to hold my hand?
I wanna reset , I wanna reset , I wanna reset

It’s just a passing wind
I try shouting at the person next to me
But only silence is looking at me
I am walking too but why are they getting farther apart?
Why am I standing here alone?
Why is only my world stopping?
I see them fading away farther and farther
I don’t care if it’s just one person, please look back, please hold my hand
I don’t care if it’s just one time, please hold my hand
Someone please stop for a moment

There’s an empty world deep in my heart, save me
I wanna reset , I wanna reset , I wanna reset
Lonely eyes trapped in darkness
Is there anyone to hold my hand?
I wanna reset , I wanna reset , I wanna reset

Your smile that’s not ridiculing me
Finds me again from disappearing
In the darkness, your smile
Shines brightly into my heart
I wanna reset , I wanna reset , I wanna reset
Your smile that’s not ridiculing me
Finds me again from disappearing
In the darkness, your smile
Shines brightly into my heart
I wanna reset , I wanna reset , I wanna reset

How about you
I`m all about you
I wanna go back to the beautiful days
reset

I’m left alone like this, loneliness
Please hold my hand right now
I wanna reset
I wanna reset
I wanna reset
The truth is hidden by scars
I wanna go back to the happy place
I wanna reset
I wanna reset
I wanna reset
