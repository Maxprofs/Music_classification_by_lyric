                        Pretty Wings
Artist: Maxwell

Time will bring the real end of our trial
One day they'll be no remnants
No trace, No residual
Feelings within ya
One day u won't remember me

Your face will be the reason I smile
But I will not see what I cannot have forever
I'll always love ya
I hope you feel the same
You play me dirty, your game was so bad
You toyed with my affliction
Had to fill out my prescription
Found a remedy
I had to set you free

Away from me
To see clearly the way that love can be
When you are not with me
I had to leave
I had to live
I had to leave
I had to live
(If I can't have you let love set you free)
(To fly your pretty wings around)
Pretty wings, your
Pretty wings Your
Pretty wings, pretty wings around... 

I came wrong,you were right
Transformed your love into "like"
Baby,believe me
I'm sorry I told you lies
I turn day into night
Sleep til I died a thousand times
I should've showed you 
better nights,better times,better days
I miss you more and more
(If I can't have you let love set you free)
(To fly your pretty wings around)
Pretty wings, your
Pretty wings Your
Pretty wings, pretty wings around..

Little wings...

Da,da,da....
Pretty wings, your pretty wings around
Pretty wings, your pretty wings around
Someone better's gonna love you... 
Someone... Someone's gonna love you baby.
Pretty wings, your pretty wings around
Pretty wings, your pretty wings around
Pretty wings, your pretty wings, your pretty wings around...
