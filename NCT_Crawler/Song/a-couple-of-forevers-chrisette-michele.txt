                        I see it clear, my heart is here
 We got each other and let's take it from there
 And if I could I'd love you a forever end time What we've been through, no one else knows
 'Cause all that matters is how far this goes
 And it will go until it starts again Me and you, I look like I might
 Nothing can stop love from love
 And our love
 You know I'm not asking for much
 Just a couple of forevers
 A couple of forevers
 I'm the only one, you're the only one
 Together 'til never
 I'm talking 'bout forever
 Just a couple of forevers
 I'm the only one, you're the only one
 Together 'til never It can get hard, damn it gets rough
 It can get crazy, but not for us
 'Cause we gotta struggle just to stay apart And me and you are, built like armour
 Nothing can't stop love from love
 And our love
 And I'm not asking for much
 Just a couple of forevers
 A couple of forevers
 I'm the only one, you're the only one
 Together 'til never
 I'm talking about forever
 Just a couple of forevers
 I'm the only one, you're the only one
 Together 'til never
 Never, never Can you see it, oh oh ooh oh
 Can you see the signs from above
 It's so blinding, there's no denying you and me You and me are built like armor
 Nothing can stop love from loving on us
 And I'm not asking you for much
 A couple of forevers
 Ever, Ever
 I'm the only one, you the only one
 Together til never
