                        Verse 1
 See I'm Going Through A Situation
 That I Can't Help
 Wanna Get A Little Closer
 But I Promised Myself
 That I Would Never
 Give My Heart A
 Away Again
 Oo Oo Babe

 I Know It's Hard
 Butcha Gotta Understand It
 The Truth Is
 All The Hurt And The Pain
 And The *** That You Get
 When You Have It
 Ain't Worth It
 I've Been There So Many Times
 I Should Know Better But I
 Can't Stop What I Feel
 When You're Next To Me
 I Really Think I

 Chorus
 Finally Found Somebody
 That Could Be The One
 But I Promised Myself
 That I Wouldn't Give In To Love
 And I'm Scared
 And I'm Nervous
 Don't Wanna Be Hurt Anymore
 This Is Bad
 Cause I Know That You're The One

 Repeat

 (Baby You're The One)

 Verse 2
 See The Problem With Relationships
 In General
 Is That It's Always A Game
 In The Beginning They'll Do
 Anything To Have You
 And Once They Do
 It's Never The Same
 And I, Know Everyone Out There
 Can Relate
 So The Question Is
 One: Do I Really Wanna Trust This Feeling
 Two: Do I Wanna Let It Pass Me By
 Three: Do You Think It's Only Superficial
 Four: Could It Actually Be Different This Time
 Someone To Love Me
 Someone To Be My Everything
 Maybe I've Stumbled Upon

 Chorus
 Finally Found Somebody (The Only One)
 That Could Be The One
 But I Promised Myself
 That I Wouldn't Give In To Love (No, No)
 And I'm Scared
 And I'm Nervous (I Just Don't Wanna Be Hurt)
 Don't Wanna Be Hurt Anymore
 This Is Bad
 Cause I Know That You're The One
 (But Boy I Think You Might Be The One)
 Finally Found Somebody
 Could Be The One
 (Maybe I've Found)
 But I Promised Myself
 That I Wouldn't Give In To Love
 And I'm Scared
 And I'm Nervous
 (Boy I'm So Afraid)
 Don't Wanna Be Hurt Anymore
 This Is Bad
 Cause I Know That You're The One
 (Cause I Know You're The One)
