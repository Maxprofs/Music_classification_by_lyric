Rock|

                        Rough and ready rider in a supersonic sound machine
 Rock and roll survivor, chrome pipes between your knees
 Runnin' all the red lights, ridin' the white lines
 Your gonna make a dead stop but you just can't see the signs Ohh, you'll never win the race but you can't give up the chase
 Death alley driver, livin' at high speed, death alley driver, yeah
 Death alley driver, who knows what you need, death alley driver One hundred twenty-five smokin' on the turns
 Always on the hit and run but you never learn
 Runnin' from the man and you're runnin' from yourself
 Another dirty angel headin' straight to hell Oh, you'll never win the race but you won't give up the chase
 Death alley driver, life in overdrive, death alley driver, yeah
 Death alley driver, ride to stay alive, death alley driver, let's go Red lights in the mirror, danger on the band
 Got to take a detour 'cause a road block's up ahead
 He takes you on a corner with a wave of his hand
 Death is in the back seat of a big old black sedan Oh, you'll never win the race as you turn and see his face
 Death alley driver, movin' for the kill, death alley driver, yeah
 Death alley driver, time is standin' still, death alley driver Always on the run cause you're a death alley driver
 Love the way it feels, death alley driver, yeah
 Death alley driver, hell on wheels, death alley driver, ohh
