                        Bài hát: A Symphony Of Justice - Sona

When I was a child
I had nobody in this world
I was left alone,
Just a sweet little quiet girl

When I tried to speak
Words I wanted to say were gone
"Someone take me soon
I've been waiting for far too long"

Years went by and still no one came
Then one day everything in my life changed
I was home and I learned to play the chords true and strong
Now I have found where I belong

Find your strength in the music ringing out to set the stage
Fly on wings of celerity, swift and true 
Perservere through the battle though you may be wearing thin 
Summoner, know that I believe in you 

I will keep you safe, feel my symphony all around 
Listen to my hymn and our victory will resound 
From my mind to yours, we will win this before to long
A sublime duet is resonating through my song

We must fight for that in which we believe 
As the harmonies interweave
Into one bright crescendo in the dance we call life 
Carving our will to end the strife

And the stars play a melody that echoes through and through 
Can you hear all the songs that Runeterra sings??
We will find our enlightenment inside the serenade 
Place your trust in the Maven of the Strings

Find your strength in the music ringing out to set the stage
Fly on wings of celerity, swift and true
Perservere through the battle though you may be wearing thin
Summoner, know that I believe in you
                        
                    |
