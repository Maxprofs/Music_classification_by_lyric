                        Bài hát: A Little Braver (Piano Cover) - V.A

With december comes the glimmer on her face 
And I get a bit nervous 
And I get a bit nervous now 
In the twelve months on I Won't make friends with change 
When everyones perfect 
Can we start over again 
The playground they get rusty and your 
Heart breaks another ten thousand years before 
I got the chance to say 
I miss you 
When it gets dark 
I get a little stronger now 
I get a little braver now 
And when it gets dark 
I get a little brighter now 
I get a little wiser now 
Before I give my heart away 
Well We met each other at the house of runaway 
I remember it perfectly we running on honesty 
We moved together like silver lock and key 
But now that your lock has changed 
I know i can't fit that way 
the playground they get rusty and your 
Heart breaks another ten thousand years before 
I got the chance to say 
I want you
                        
                    |
