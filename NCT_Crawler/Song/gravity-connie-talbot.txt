                        Bài hát: Gravity - Connie Talbot

Summer breeze
Coco Keys
Hanging out you and me
In the sun, oh oh
Ben and Jerry's
Cups and cones
Wasting time
Playing games on our phones
Oh well
We seemed so picture perfect
We laughed without a purpose
We laughed without a purpose

But deep beneath the surface
You're making me nervous
You're making me so nervous

You're holding me down with your gravity
With your gravity
I need to fly free, but you imprison me,
With your gravity oh...
It's killing me, I gotta leave,
I'm moving on and on and on
And now I see what's best for me,
Escape your gravity

Back at home Kensal Row
You light up on my phone, oh oh
I don't know
Should I pick it up or ignore hold you close
Build a wall or chase you right out the door

But deep beneath the surface
You're making me nervous
You're making me so nervous
You're holding me down with your gravity

With your gravity
I need to fly free, but you imprison me,
With your gravity oh...
It's killing me, I gotta leave,
I'm moving on and on and on
And now I see what's best for me,
Escape your gravity
Escape your gravity

You hold me down with your gravity
Your gravity
I need to fly free, from your gravity
It's killing me, oh

You're holding me down with your gravity
With your gravity
I need to fly free, but you imprison me,
With your gravity oh...
It's killing me, I gotta leave,
I'm moving on and on and on
Now I see what's best for me,
Escaping gravity
Escape your gravity
Your gravity
                        
                    |
