                        Song: Que Sera, Sera - Shakin' Stevens

When I was just a little boy
I asked my mama, what will I be
Will I be handsome, will I be rich
Here's what she said to me.

Que Sera, Sera,
Whatever will be, will be
The future's not ours, to see
Que Sera, Sera

Que Sera, Sera,
Whatever will be, will be
The future's not ours, to see
Que Sera, Sera

Que Sera, Sera,
Whatever will be, will be
The future's not ours, to see
Que Sera, Sera

Que Sera, Sera,
Whatever will be, will be
The future's not ours, to see
Que Sera, Sera
"Now you sing it"

Que Sera, Sera,
Whatever will be, will be
The future's not ours, to see
Que Sera, Sera

Que Sera, Sera, "Sing With Me!"
Whatever will be, will be
The future's not ours, to see
Que Sera, Sera

Que Sera, Sera,
Whatever will be, will be
The future's not ours, to see
Que Sera, Sera

Que Sera, Sera,
Whatever will be, will be
The future's not ours, to see
Girl screaming, I LOVE YOU
Que Sera
Que Sera
Que Sera, Seeraaaaah
