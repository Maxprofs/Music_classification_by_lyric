                        Refrain
 Cupid draw back your bow
 And let your arrow flow
 Straight to my lover's heart for me
 Nobody else but me hey hey hey
 Cupid please hear my cry
 And let your arrow fly
 Straight to my lover's heart for me

 Listen I don't want to bother you but I'm in distress
 There's danger of me loosing all of my happiness
 Cause I love a girl who doesn't know I exist
 Ah and this yoy can fix so...

 Refrain

 Now Cupid if your arrow makes her love strong for me
 I swear I'm gonna love her until eternity
 I know that tween the both of us her heart we can steal
 Cupid help me if you will so...

 Refrain

 Hey Cupid Cupid I'm calling
 Don't you hear me I'm calling you
 (fade)
