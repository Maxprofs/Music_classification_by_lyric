                        "If", all I could say is "if."
 Promise you will not regret me when you're touching my skin
 Like the wrong path.
 Promise me that when they all love you, that you will remember me.
 And when you *** them you see my face
 My body is yours 
 For Thursday.

 It seems that pain and regret are your best friends
 Ooooh, oh yeah.
 Cause everything you do leads to them, right, right, right.
 Yeah, well baby I can be your best friend, oooh.
 And baby I can *** you right, oooh.

 Whoa, baby you can have it all, oooh yeah.
 Baby, you can have it all, ooh yeah.
 Baby you can have the cars, the clothes, 
 The dreams, the sex, the house, 
 Baby you could be a star, oh yeah.
 Baby you could have it all.
 Baby you could have it all.
 Baby you can have the cars, the clothes, 
 The dreams, the sex, the house, 
 Baby you could be a star.

 Whoa, blaming all your sins on your best friends.
 And nothing's never ever your fault
 And nothing's your fault, baby.
 Well baby you don't need your best friends, whoa.
 Cause I got everything you want.
 Ooooh aay yeah.

 Baby you could have it all, oooh baby.
 Baby you could have it all, oooh.
 Baby you could have the cars, the clothes, 
 The dreams, the sex, the house, 
 Baby you could be a star
 Baby you could be a star
 Baby you could have it all
 Baby you could have it all, whoa yeah.
 Baby you could have the cars, the clothes, 
 The dreams, the sex, the house.
 Baby you could be a star, oh yeah.

 "If," all I could say is "if"
 Promise me you won't regret me when you're touching on my skin
 Let the wrong path come to me
 One day I'm hoping that you, will remember me
 When you *** them you'll see my face
 My body is yours
 Give them any other day but Thursday
 You belong to me
 Every thursday
 I wait for you
 I'll be beautiful for you
 Every Thursday
 I exist
 Only on Thursday.

 Not on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday, 
 But on Thursday, Thursday.
 Not on Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday, 
 But on Thursday.

 I love the guitars!
