Title: That's When I Knew
Artist: Alicia Keys

Right there
In the middle of a conversation
Wasn't anything special you said
It was just there

Right then
I didn't have time to even over-think it
I loved you and all of a sudden, 
I was all in
It's like my knees are all weak and the butterflies
They were dancing taking all of my air
From that moment on it was very clear

That’s when I knew I fell in love
That’s when I knew you were the one
That’s when I knew you stole my heart away from me
That’s when I knew that I was sunk
That was the moment that I knew I was in love
That’s when I knew, 
That’s when I knew
That’s when I knew that day

I didn't know we were going where the night would end
I didn't know there was something brewing
And if it was I didn't know how much I care

That touch, 
When you barely held my hand I was overcome
With feelings I don't understand
Not in a million years I didn't think that we'd be here

It's like my knees are all weak and the butterflies
Got me dancing taking all of my air
From that moment on it was very very very very clear

That’s when I knew I fell in love
That’s when I knew you were the one
That’s when I knew you stole my heart away from me
That’s when I knew that I was sunk
That was the moment that I knew I was in love
That’s when I knew
That’s when I knew
That’s when I knew, 
Don't you know it? Hey!

That’s when I knew
That’s when I knew
That’s when I knew 
Baby

You know need to know
You know what you feel
And there's no denying
And no, it's for real
There's nothing to do
Just there it is gotta surrender

That’s when I knew I fell in love
That’s when I knew you were the one
That’s when I knew you stole my heart away from me
That’s when I knew that I was sunk
That was the moment that I knew I fell in love

(That’s when I knew, that’s when I knew...)

That’s when I knew with that minute
That’s when I knew it was that beautiful
Sometimes you get it, sometimes you get it
That’s when I knew it baby
Yeah, that’s when I knew
That’s when I knew we fell in love
