                        Bài hát: New Rules (Dua Lipa Cover) - J.Fla

Talkin' in my sleep at night 
Makin' myself crazy 
(Out of my mind, out of my mind) 
Wrote it down and read it out 
Hopin' it would save me 
(Too many times, too many times) 
Oh, he makes me feel like nobody else 
Nobody else 
But my love, he doesn't love me 
So I tell myself, I tell myself 

One, don't pick up the phone 
You know he's only calling 'cause he's drunk and alone 
Two, don't let him in 
You have to kick him out again 
Three, don't be his friend 
You know you're gonna wake up in his bed in the morning 
And if you're under him 
You ain't getting over him 

I've got new rules, I count 'em 
I've got new rules, I count 'em 
I've gotta tell them to myself 
I've got new rules, I count 'em 
I've gotta tell them to myself 

I keep pushin' forwards 
But he keeps pullin' me backwards 
(Nowhere to turn, no way) 
(Nowhere to turn, no) 
Now I'm standing back from it 
I finally see the pattern 
(I never learn, I never learn) 
But my love, he never loves me 
So I tell myself, I tell myself 
I do, I do, I do 

One, don't pick up the phone 
You know he's only calling 'cause he's drunk and alone 
Two, don't let him in 
You have to kick him out again 
Three, don't be his friend 
You know you're gonna wake up in his bed in the morning 
And if you're under him 
You ain't getting over him 

I've got new rules, I count 'em 
I've got new rules, I count 'em 
I've gotta tell them to myself 
I've got new rules, I count 'em 
I've gotta tell them to myself
                        
                    |
