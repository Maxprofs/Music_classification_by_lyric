                        Bài hát: LK Joy Hey, Hello, Touch By Touch - Quốc Khanh, Philip Huy, Sỹ Đan

When I feel the time is right and your staying by my side

And the love you give to me makes my heart beat
When my fantasy fly away but my feelings make me stay
I see the fire in your eyes, it makes my heart beat
Do it, we'll still do it night and day
You're my all time lover
Do it, we'll still do it anyway
Like there is no other
Touch by touch, you're my all time lover
Skin to skin, come undone my cover

When my heart full of love it makes me a turtle in dove
Love the game that we play night and day
When our love is clear and bright it's our way to see the light
There's a fire in our heart night and day
Do it, we'll still do it night and day
You're my all time lover
Do it, we'll still do it anyway
Like there is no other
Touch by touch, your my all time lover
Skin to skin, come undone my cover
Do it, we'll still do it night and day
You're my all time lover
Do it, we'll still do it anyway
Like there is no other
Touch by touch, you're my all time lover
Skin to skin, come undone my covers
Do it, we'll still do it night and day
You're my all time lover
Do it, we'll still do it anyway
Like there is no other
Touch by touch, your my all time lover
Skin to skin, come undone my covers

When I saw you at the party
You were talking to a girlfriend
I just walked across the room and said "hello" (hello hello)
While we danced I felt your body,
Touched your face and dared to kiss you
When the song was over I just couldn't let you go (let you go)


CHORUS:

Hey hello (hello) be my darling
Hey hello (hello) be my girl
Always wanted so much more than just a one night love affair
Hey hello (hello) feel the magic
Hey hello (hello) in the air
I can give you so much more than just a one night love affair

Midnight hour, my apartment
I can feel your burning passion
When I loved you in the shadow of the night
You were leaving in the morning
But you promised to recall me
One more kiss - "I'll see you soon" - and then goodbye (goodbye)
                        
                    |
