                        Bài hát: One Kiss - Calvin Harris, Dua Lipa

[Chorus: Dua Lipa]
One kiss is all it takes
Falling in love with me
Possibilities
I look like all you need

[Verse 1: Dua Lipa]
Let me take the night, I love real easy
And I know that you'll still wanna see me
On the Sunday morning, music real loud
Let me love you while the moon is still out

[Pre-Chorus: Dua Lipa]
Something in you lit up heaven in me
The feeling won't let me sleep
'Cause I'm lost in the way you move, the way you feel

[Chorus: Dua Lipa]
One kiss is all it takes
Falling in love with me
Possibilities
I look like all you need
One kiss is all it takes
Falling in love with me
Possibilities
I look like all you need

[Post-Chorus: Dua Lipa]
One
One
Darling
One
One
Darling

[Verse 2: Dua Lipa]
I just wanna feel your skin on mine
Feel your eyes do the exploring
Passion in the message when you smile
Take my time

[Pre-Chorus: Dua Lipa]
It's something in you lit up heaven in me
The feeling won't let me sleep
'Cause I'm lost in the way you move, the way you feel

[Chorus: Dua Lipa]
One kiss is all it takes
Falling in love with me
Possibilities
I look like all you need
One kiss is all it takes
Falling in love with me
Possibilities
I look like all you need

[Post-Chorus: Dua Lipa]
One
One
Darling
One
One
Darling

[Bridge: Dua Lipa]
See a wonderland in your eyes
Might need your company tonight

[Pre-Chorus: Dua Lipa]
Something in you lit up heaven in me
The feeling won't let me sleep
'Cause I'm lost in the way you move, the way you feel

[Chorus: Dua Lipa]
One kiss is all it takes
Falling in love with me
Possibilities
I look like all you need
One kiss is all it takes
Falling in love with me
Possibilities
I look like all you need

[Post-Chorus: Dua Lipa]
One
One
Darling
One
One
Darling
