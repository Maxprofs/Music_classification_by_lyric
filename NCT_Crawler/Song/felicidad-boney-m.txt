                        Song: Felicidad - Boney M.

Only Margherita love like America
Only Margherita move like the Mardi Gras
Mama
Oh mama
Now mama.

Come tell me that you want to
You want to
Oh mama
In my pyjama
My imagination carry my mind away.

Only Margherita feel like a holiday
Mama
Oh mama
Now mama.

Come tell me that you want to
You want to
Oh
Mama
You wild madonna.

Mama
Oh mama
Now mama.

Come tell me that you
.. .
Felicidad.

And I can't help but feeling this way
You're the one who can change my tomorrow toda
Felicidad.

Won't you ride on the wings of my fantasy
And this summersong will last a whole life long
Only Margherita love like America.

Only Margherita take me to shangri-la
Mama
Oh mama
