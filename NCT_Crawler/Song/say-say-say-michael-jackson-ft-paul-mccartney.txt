                        Bài hát: Say Say Say - Michael Jackson, Paul McCartney

Say, Say, Say What You Want,
But Don't Play Games With My Affection.
Take, Take, Take What You Need,
But Don't Leave Me With No Direction.

All Alone, I Sit Home By The Phone,
Waiting For You, Baby.
Through The Years,
How Can You Stand To Hear,
My Pleading For You Dear?
You Know I'm Crying Ooh Ooh Ooh Ooh.

Go, Go, Go Where You Want,
But Don't Leave Me Here Forever.
You, You, You Stay Away,
So Long Girl, I See You Never.

What Can I Do
Girl To Get Through To You?
Cause I Love You Baby.
Standing Here, Baptisted In All My Tears,
Baby Through The Years,
You Know I'm Crying Ooh Ooh Ooh Ooh.

You Never Worry,
And You Never Shed A Tear.
You Saying That My Love Ain't Real,
Just Look At My Face,
These Tears Ain't Drying

You, You, You Can Never Say,
That I'm Not The One Who Really Loves You.
I Pray, Pray, Pray Every Day
That You'll See Things, Girl Like I Do.

What Can I Do Girl, To Get Through To You? Cause I Love You Baby.
Standing Here Baptised In All My Tears, Baby Through The Years,
You Know I'm Crying, Ooh Ooh Ooh Ooh Ooh
                        
                    |
