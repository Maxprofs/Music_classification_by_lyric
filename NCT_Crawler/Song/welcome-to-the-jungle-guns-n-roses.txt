                        Bài hát: Welcome To The Jungle - Guns N' Roses

Welcome to the jungle 
we got fun n' games
We got everything you want
honey, we know the names,
We are the people that can find 
whatever you may need
If you got the money, honey, we got your disease, 
In the jungle
Welcome to the jungle
Watch it bring you to your sha na...... knees, knees
I wanna watch you bleed
Welcome to the jungle 
we take it day by day
If you want it you're gonna bleed but it's the price you pay, 
And you're a very sexy girl that's very hard to please 
You can taste the bright lights but you won't get them for free 
In the jungle
Welcome to the jungle
Feel my, my, my serpentine
I, I wanna hear you scream

Welcome to the jungle it gets worse here every day 
Ya learn to live like an animal, in the jungle where we play 
If you got a hunger for what you see, you'll take it eventually 
You can have anything you want, but you better not take it from me 
In the jungle
Welcome to the jungle
Watch it bring you to your sha na...... knees, knees
I wanna watch you bleed

And when you're high you never,
Ever want to come down so down...... yeah !

You know where you are? You're in the jungle, baby ! ,
You're gonna die!
In the jungle
Welcome to the jungle
Watch it bring you to your sha na...... knees, knees
In the jungle
Welcome to the jungle
Feel my, my, my serpentine
In the jungle
Welcome to the jungle
Watch it bring you to your sha na...... knees, knees
In the jungle
Welcome to the jungle
Watch it bring you to your
It's gonna bring you down Ha !
