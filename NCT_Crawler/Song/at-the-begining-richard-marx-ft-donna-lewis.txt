                        We were strangers
Starting out on a journey
Never dreaming what wed have to go through
Now here we are
And Im suddenly standing
At the beginning with you

No one told me, that I was going to find you
Unexpected, what you did to my heart
When I lost hope
You were there to remind me
This is the start

[Chorus:]
And life is a road I wanna keep going
Love is a river I want to keep flowing
Life is road now and forever
Wonderful journey
I'll be there when the world stops turning
I'll be there when the storm is through
In the end I wanna be standing
At the beginning with you

We were strangers
On a crazy adventure
Never dreaming that dreams would com true
Now here we stand unafraid of the future
At the beginning with you

[Chorus:]
And life is a road I wanna keep going
Love is a river I want to keep flowing
Life is road now and forever
Wonderful journey
I'll be there when the world stops turning
I'll be there when the storm is through
In the end I wanna be standing
At the beginning with you

Knew there was somebody somewhere
Like me alone in the dark
Now I know that my dream will live on
Ive been waiting so long
Nothings gonna tear us apart

[Chorus:]
And life is a road I wanna keep going
Love is a river I want to keep flowing
Life is road now and forever
Wonderful journey
I'll be there when the world stops turning
I'll be there when the storm is through
In the end I wanna be standing
At the beginning with you
                        
                    |
