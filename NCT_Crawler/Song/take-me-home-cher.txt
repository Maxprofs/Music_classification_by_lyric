The Showdown - Take Me Home

The burning, the bleeding
The lifetime spent retreating
The black eyes, the white lights
The love that will not die

Now the dreams bring troubled sleep, so keep them away
Stretched along the road too thin, by too many days

Take me home
Southland's calling my name
Neither love nor man nor law could keep me away
Take me home
Southland's calling my name
Neither love nor man nor law could keep me away

He won't give, he must live
He cannot give into this
His blood cold, he craves home
The weary soldier crawls

Now the dreams bring troubled sleep, so keep them away
Stretched along the road too thin, by too many days

Take me home
Southland's calling my name
Neither love nor man nor law could keep me away
Take me home
Southland's calling my name
Neither love nor man nor law won't keep me away

Take me home
Southland's calling my name
Neither love nor man nor law would keep me away
Take me home
Southland's calling my name
Neither love nor man nor law won't keep me away
Neither love nor man nor law won't keep me away
