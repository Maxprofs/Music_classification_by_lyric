                        Song: Tired Of Being Sorry - Enrique Iglesias

I don't know why
You wanna follow me tonight?
When in the rest of the world
With whom I've crossed and I've quarreled

Let's me down so
A thousand reasons that I know
To share forever the unrest
With all the demons I possess, beneath the silver moon

Maybe you were right
But baby I was lonely
I don't wanna fight
I'm tired of being sorry

Keep the oceans dry
With all the vampires and their brides
We're all bloodless and blind
And longing for a life beyond the silver moon

Maybe you were right
But baby I was lonely
I don't wanna fight
I'm tired of being sorry

I'm standing in the street
Crying out for you
No one sees me
But the silver moon

So far away
So outer space
I've trashed myself, I've lost my way
I've got to get to you, got to get to you

Maybe you were right
But baby I was lonely
I don't wanna fight
I'm tired of being sorry

I'm standing in the street
Crying out for you
No one sees me
But the silver moon

Maybe you were right
But baby I was lonely
I don't wanna fight
I'm tired of being sorry

I'm standing in the street
Crying out for you
No one sees me
But the silver moon

Maybe you were right
                        
                    |
