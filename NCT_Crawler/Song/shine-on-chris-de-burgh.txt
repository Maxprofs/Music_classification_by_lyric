                        Shine on, brighter than the sun
 Live for every moment
 Before the moment's gone
 We shine on, you and me tonight
 Way across the universe
 Burning like a fire in the night I was looking at a photograph
 Taken in a garden long before the war
 And out on the lawn
 There were old men and dogs, and little children
 All of them gone forever There were people by the waterside
 Standing in the same place where I am today
 Nothing has changed but you know
 That time is moving like a river
 It can only be love forever We shine on, brighter than the sun
 Live for every moment
 Before the moment's gone
 We shine on, you and me tonight
 Way across the universe
 Burning like a fire in the night There are those who can never cross
 The space between a father and a son
 When they are young
 We must say all the words that should be spoken
 Before they are lost forever And I was looking at a photograph
 Taken from a window way above the world
 We've got to learn
 We must leave here a garden for our children
 When we are gone forever We shine on, brighter than the sun
 Live for every moment, before the moment's gone
 We shine on, you and me tonight
 Way across the universe
 Burning like a fire in the night (Shine on)
 Leave here a garden for the children
 (Shine on)
 Leave here a new world
 Leave here a garden for the children
 (Shine on)
 Leave here a new world Leave here a garden
 (Shine on)
 Leave here a new world
 (Shine on) Leave here a garden for the children
 (Shine on)
 Leave here a new world
 Leave here a garden for the children
 (Shine on)
 Leave here a new world
