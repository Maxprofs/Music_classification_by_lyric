                        Bài hát: Let It Go - Nervo, Nicky Romero

Now starts the time
Starts the time, starts the time
Here we draw the line
Draw the line, draw the line

Today doesn't start again
Doesn't ever get a second chance
It's too late if you're wondering
Cause you're never gonna take it back
Right now all that matters is
Is how we're gonna let it go
So leave out what you cannot change
And pretty soon you're gonna now

Let it go, let it go
Let it go, gotta let it go
Let it go, let it go
Let it go and lose control
Let it go, let it go
Let it go, gotta let it go
Let it go, let it go
Let it go and lose control

Now starts the time
Starts the time, starts the time
Here we draw the line
Draw the line, draw the line
Cause your eyes don't lie from what they're meaning
And the light inside keeps you holding on

Right now all that matters is
Is how we're gonna let it go
So leave out what you cannot change
And pretty soon you're gonna now

Let it go, let it go
Let it go, gotta let it go
Let it go, let it go
Let it go and lose control
Let it go, let it go
Let it go, gotta let it go
Let it go, let it go
Let it go and lose control

You, you got the chance, you do
Nobody else but you
[?]
Nothing can break you now
