Rock|

                        I twist and turn in the darkest space
 Can't find my worth as I numb the pain
 Glass to the sky with a black tooth grin
 This whiskey smile that takes me down again I'm cold and I'm so afraid
 That I'm too weak and I can't change I've been buried alive
 And I don't want to be here anymore
 Reached out a thousand times
 For a hand to pull me from below I've been buried alive
 In a world of constant sorrow
 Reached down tonight and set me free
 Save tomorrow Another shot slip into the haze
 Another night soaked in my disgrace
 So sooth the lie, I raise my glass and run
 A wasted life, what have I become? I've been buried alive
 And I don't want to be here anymore
 Reached out a thousand times
 For a hand to pull me from below I've been buried alive
 In a world of constant sorrow
 Reached out tonight and set me free
 Save tomorrow Save tomorrow
 Save tomorrow Let me breathe again
 And show me where I begin
 To find a will to change
 Before I lose everything Before I lose everything I've been buried alive
 And I don't want to be here anymore
 Reached out a thousand times
 For a hand to pull me from below I've been buried alive
 In a world of constant sorrow
 Reached down tonight and set me free
 And I will follow I've been buried alive
 I've been buried alive
 I've been buried alive
 I've been buried alive
                        
                    |
