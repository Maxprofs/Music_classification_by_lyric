                        Hello?
Hi it's me what's up baby? I'm sorry listen I'm gonna be late tonight so don't stay up and wait for me ok?
Where are you?
What? say... say that again
Hello?
You're really dropping out, I think my battery must be low.
Listen if you can hear me we're going to this place nearby, all right? Gotta go.

Let me tell you the story 
'Bout the call that changed my destiny 
Me and my boys went out 
Just to end up in misery 
Was about to go home when 
There she was standing in-front of me 
And said "Hi, I got a little place nearby 
Wanna go?" 

I should've said no 
Someone's waiting for me 
Then I called my girl up and said 

(Chorus) 
Listen baby, I'm sorry 
Just wanna tell you don't worry 
I will be late 
Don't stay up and wait for me 
I said again, you're dropping out 
My battery is low 
Just so you know 
We're going to a place nearby 
Gotta go 

Now two years gone, nothing's been won 
I can't take it back, what's done is done 
But one of her friends found out 
That she wasn't my only one 
And it eats me from inside 
That she's not by my side 
Just because I made that call, yeah 

(Chorus) 
Listen baby, I'm sorry 
Just wanna tell you don't worry 
I will be late 
Don't stay up and wait for me 
I said again, you're dropping out 
My battery is low 
Just so you know 
We're going to a place nearby 
Gotta go 

Ooohh... 

Lemme tell you the story 
Bout the call that changed my destiny 
Me and my boys went out 
Just to end up in misery 
Was about to go home when 
There she was standing infront of me 
And said "Hi, I got a little place nearby" 
Gotta go... 

(Chorus) 
Listen baby, I'm sorry 
Just wanna tell you don't worry 
I will be late 
Don't stay up and wait for me 
I said again, you're dropping out 
My battery is low 
Just so you know 
We're going to a place nearby 
Gotta go 

(Chorus) 
Listen baby, I'm sorry 
Just wanna tell you don't worry 
I will be late 
Don't stay up and wait for me 
I said again, you're dropping out 
My battery is low 
Just so you know 
We're going to a place nearby 
We're going to a place nearby
Gotta go
