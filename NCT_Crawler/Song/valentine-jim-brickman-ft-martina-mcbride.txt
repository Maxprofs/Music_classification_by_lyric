                        If there were no words, no way to speak
I would still hear you
If there were no tears,no way to feel inside I'd still feel for you
And even if the sun refused to shine
Even if romance ran out of rhyme
You would still have my heart until the and time
You all, i need,my love, my valentine
All of my life,I have been watting for 
All you give to me you've opened my eyes
And shown me how to love unselfishly
I've dreamed of this a thousand time before
But in my dream I couldn't love you more
I'll give you my heart until the end of time
You're all, I need,my love, my valentine
And even if the sun refused to shine
Even if romance ran out of rhyme
You would still have my heart until the end of time
You're all, i need,is love, my valentine
You're all, i need,my love, my valentine.
