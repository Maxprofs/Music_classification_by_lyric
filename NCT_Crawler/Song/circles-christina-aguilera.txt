                        Spin around in circles on my middle middle finger (x2)
Won't you
Round and round sit on my middle finger mother****er (x2)

So you went around went around talking ****-ahh ****-aah
Keep my name up out your mouth spit it out you bitch-aa bitch-aa
Wish that you could hang around me and my thick-aa thick-aa
Limelights, prime life how you get the pictchaa-pictchaaa

Hold up
I got more money than I can fold up
I see you superhatin' when your roll up
And I suggest that you go and grow the **** up (ha)
Or you can spin around in circles

Spin around in circles on my middle middle finger (x4)

I see you run around run around like you gita-gita
Why you always tryna be up in my mixture mixture
Cause I'm freaky fly fashion you just bitter bitter
Shine bright day and night no matter how I get up get up

Hold up
I got more money than I can fold up
I see you superhatin' when your roll up
And I suggest that you go and grow the **** up (ha)
Or you can spin around in circles

Spin around in circles on my middle middle finger (x4)

Use my name as your claim to fame
Got my seal of success
I'm your bread
Desperate
You're a mess
Go ahead get your press
You're no win
You're shameless
Think you'll rain on my middle
Tryna break me but you can just

Spin around in circles on my middle middle finger (x6)

Round and round muther****er (x2)
