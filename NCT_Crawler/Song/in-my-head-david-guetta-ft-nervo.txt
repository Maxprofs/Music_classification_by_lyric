                        Bài hát : In My Head - David Guetta, Nervo

Is everybody broken hearted?
We are living in a clouded dream
A skyscraper seems so tall
But no one fights, no one learns
We just push until it burns
No, I can't understand

Tell me I'm mad 'cause in my head
We work it out
You turn this around
And the stars do come out

'Cause in my head
Nothing's too hard
We fight for us
And we never give up

In my head

'Cause in my head
Nothing's too hard
We fight for us
And we never give up

In my head
In my head

So is this really what you wanted?
I'm knowing it but just turn it around
'Cause no matter what I try
I tried but...

In my head
Nothing's too hard
We fight for us
And we never give up

In my head
In my head
In my head
In my head

In my head
Nothing's too hard
We fight for us
And we never give up

It's in my head
In my head

Go!

'Cause in my head
Nothing's too hard
We fight for us
And we never give up

In my head
                        
                    |
