Somebody that's got confidence
You know it's in her attitude
The way she walks, nice legs
She's gotta be beautiful, nice thin waste
Fat ass, ooh
And those soft little lips
Little lips, little lips, little lips

Little lips, little lips, little lips, little lips
Little lips, little lips, little lips, little lips
I wonder if your lips are as soft as I imagine them to me
Little lips, little lips, little lips, little lips
Little lips, little lips, little lips, little lips
Little lips, little lips, little lips, little lips
Little lips, little lips, little lips, little lips
Little lips, little lips, little lips, little lips
The crazy thing is you're the only girl I love
Little lips, little lips, little lips

I bend my knees at all the things that don't exist yet
Like the breakfast on Sunday mornings after drunk sex
Or when you're out with your girls and you send me a drunk text
Saying "baby are you ***, don't you come close to my heart"
I miss you girl, wherever you are

Oh, I'm missing you, already
And I just wanna kiss you, already
So come on, come on, come on
If you are ready, hurry up to the phone
You don't know I miss you, already
Girl I miss you, yeah

Little lips, little lips, little lips, little lips
Little lips, little lips, little lips, little lips
Little lips, little lips, little lips, little lips
Little lips, little lips, little lips, little lips
Little lips, little lips, little lips, little lips
Little lips, little lips, little lips, little lips
Little lips, little lips, little lips, little lips
Little lips, little lips, little lips, little lips

Pillow covers covered in traces of your makeup
And, if I ever treat, gonna taste your flavor, real
I dreamt about you last night, I ain't wanna wake up
Even though I can't see you so far
Just like the the tint of my car
I miss you girl, wherever you are

Oh, I'm missing you, already
And I just wanna kiss you, already
So come on, come on, come on
If you are ready, hurry up to the home
You don't know I miss you

I like the way your frame is
I wonder if you're sex is as good as I assume it's gon'
The crazy thing is you already knew what it was

Take this, take that girl, but don't take time
You take my heart, come claim mine
Won't wait forever but I wait for you
Don't take forever girl cause I'm missin' u

Oh, I'm missing you, already
And I just wanna kiss you, already
So come on, come on, come on
If you are ready, hurry up to the phone
You don't know I miss you, already
Girl I miss you, yeah
