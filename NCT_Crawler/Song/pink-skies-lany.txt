                        Bài hát: Pink Skies - Lany

Thrift store fashion imperfect tattoos
Taking showers minus shampoo
You are my favorite everything
Been telling girls that since I was 16
Shut up I love you you’re my best friend

Get ya under pink skies I know exactly where we should go
‘cause I love the way your green eyes mix with that Malibu indigo
Talking under pink skies I think our hearts are starting to show
That it’s better you and I under pink skies

Underwear I kinda care wanna look good for you
British bomb you turn me on no matter what ya do
You are my favorite everything
Been telling you that since 2015
Shut up I love you you’re my best friend

Get ya under pink skies I know exactly where we should go
‘cause I love the way your green eyes mix with that Malibu indigo
Talking under pink skies I think our hearts are starting to show
That it’s better you and I under pink skies

We can work it out you and I are meant to be together
This is how it’s supposed to feel I’m in love with how this feels

Get ya under pink skies I know exactly where we should go
‘cause I love the way your green eyes mix with that Malibu indigo
Talking under pink skies I think our hearts are starting to show
That it’s better you and I under pink skies.
