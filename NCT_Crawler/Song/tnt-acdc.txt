Oi (15 times)
See me ride out of that sunset
On your color TV screen
Out for all that I can get
If you know what I mean
Women to the left of me
And women to the right
Ain't got no gun
Ain't got no knife
Don't you start no fight
Cause I'm TNT. I'm dynamite
TNT. and I'll win that fight
TNT. I'm a power load
TNT. watch me explode
I'm dirty, mean and mighty unclean
I'm a wanted man
Public enemy number one
Understand?
So lock up your daughter
Lock up your wife
Lock up your back door
And run for your life
The man is back in town
So don't you mess around
Cause I'm TNT., I'm dynamite
TNT. and I'll win the fight
TNT. oi, oi, oi
TNT. oi
I'm dynamite (oi, oi)
And I'll win the fight (oi, oi)
I'm a power load (oi, oi)
TNT.
Watch me explode
