                        Bài hát: Stuck In The Middle - One Ok Rock

What we finally found wasn't what we wanted
Wish I could have gone to where we started

Back to black I can't see what's around me
Back to black hope to gain some control

I gave up everything

I tried to have it all
And I'm stuck in the middle
I couldn't have it all now I'm alone
And I've been down and out
Now I'm stuck in the middle
I'll never get to say this is enough

Now I'm left with nothing
Now I'm left with nothing
Now I'm left with nothing Now

Teniireta mono de kowashite munashiku natte
Tebanashite mitara mitade mata hoshiku natte
No kurikaeshi de hamatte nuke rarenakute kidzuku to
Toki sudeni ososhi kira reta kippu ni furidashi no moji

I tried to have it all
And I'm stuck in the middle
I couldn't have it all I'm alone now
And I've been down and out
Now I'm stuck in the middle
I'll never get to say this is enough

Now I'm left with nothing now

Now I'm left with nothing

I gave up everything

I tried to have it all
And I'm stuck in the middle
I couldn't have it all now I'm alone
And I've been down and out
Now I'm stuck in the middle
I'll never get to say this is enough

Now I'm left with nothing
Now I'm left with nothing
Now I'm left with nothing
Now

Now I'm left with nothing
