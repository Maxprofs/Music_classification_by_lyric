                        there’s a fire starting in my heart
reaching a fever pitch, and it’s bringing me out the dark
finally i can see you crystal clear
go ahead and sell me out and i’ll lay your * bare
see how i’ll leave with every piece of you
don’t underestimate the things that i will do

there’s a fire starting in my heart
reaching a fever pitch
and it’s bringing me out the dark

the scars of your love remind me of us
they keep me thinking that we almost had it all
the scars of your love, they leave me breathless
i can’t help feeling
we could have had it all
rolling in the deep
(tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
you had my heart inside of your hand
(you’re gonna wish you never had met me)
and you played it to the beat
(tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)

baby, i have no story to be told
but i’ve heard one of you
and i’m gonna make your head burn
think of me in the depths of your despair
making a home down there
as mine sure won’t be shared

the scars of your love remind me of us
they keep me thinking that we almost had it all
the scars of your love, they leave me breathless
i can’t help feeling
we could have had it all
rolling in the deep
(tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
you had my heart inside of your hand
(you’re gonna wish you never had met me)
and you played it to the beat
(tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
we could have had it all
rolling in the deep
you had my heart inside of your hand
but you played it with a beating

throw your soul through every open door
count your blessings to find what you look for
turn my sorrow into treasured gold
you pay me back in kind and reap just what you sow

(you’re gonna wish you never had met me)
we could have had it all
(tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
we could have had it all
(you’re gonna wish you never had met me)
it all, it all, it all
(tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)

we could have had it all
(you’re gonna wish you never had met me)
rolling in the deep
(tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
you had my heart inside of your hand
(you’re gonna wish you never had met me)
and you played it to the beat
(tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)

you could have had it all
(you’re gonna wish you never had met me)
rolling in the deep
(tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep)
you had my heart inside of your hand
(you’re gonna wish you never had met me)

but you played it
you played it
you played it
you played it to the beat
