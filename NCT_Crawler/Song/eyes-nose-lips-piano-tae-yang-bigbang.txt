                        Bài hát: Eyes, Nose, Lips (Piano) - Tae Yang (BIGBANG)

You never really got to lie
I just need you to say goodbye
Then I'll really let you go
And you'll never see me so just,
Stop wasting my time

I'll never come around you again, No more
This will be the end, now just shut that door
But you'll miss me everyday,
So hurt in every way
It will probably make you wanna go and drive yourself insane
'
You could have it all but you broke my heart
And now I gotta do what I do
You know you always bring out the best in me
But you played me for a fool
Why you do that babe
It doesnt have to be this way
But there's no way I could stay

And your eyes, nose, lips
It hunts my memory
I can't forget you if I try
I wanna believe in your lies

And your eyes, nose, lips
It hunts my memory
I can't forget you if I die
Feels like I'm losing my mind

I'm tired, I'm tired, I'm so done
Before you wake up I will be gone
No more sitting home alone
Or waiting for your phone call
You don't deserve my love

Now you can go look for that girl next door
Caus you ain't the one I can call my own
I know you'll miss me everyday
So hurting every way
It will probably make you wanna go and drive yourself insane

You could have had it all, but you chose her
And now I gotta find someone new
You don't even know you had the best in me
Now who looks like a fool
Why'd you do that babe
It doesn't have to be this way
But there's no way I could stay

And your eyes, nose, lips
It hunts my memory
I can't forget you if I try
I wanna believe in your lies

And your eyes, nose, lips
It hunts my memory
I can't forget you if I die
Feels like I'm losing my mind

I wish that I could make this all go way
But it seems there's no way I canescape
But I'll be okay if I never have to see your face again

And your eyes, nose, lips
It hunts my memory
I can't forget you if I try (If I try, If I try)
I wanna believe in your lies (I wanna believe in your lies)

And your eyes, nose, lips
It hunts my memory
I can't forget you if I die
Feels like I'm losing my mind
                        
                    |
