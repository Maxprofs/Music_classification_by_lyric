Hold me up 
And take me in 
I’m losing it 
Lost again 
So maybe I fall 
Maybe I fail 
Maybe my hearts not made of stone 
Maybe you’ll see 
Secrets I’d never want to show 
But I can’t help it 
I’m not superhuman 
I’m breaking 
Don’t let me fall apart 
But I can’t help it 
I’m not superhuman 
I’m breaking 
Don’t let me fall apart 
So maybe I fall 
Maybe I fail 
Maybe my hearts not made of stone 
Maybe you’ll see 
Secrets I’d never want to show 
But I can’t help it 
I’m not superhuman 
I’m breaking 
Don’t let me fall apart 
But I can’t help it 
I’m not superhuman 
I’m breaking 
Don’t let me fall apart 
But I can’t help it 
I’m not superhuman 
I’m breaking
Don’t let me fall apart 
But I can’t help it 
I’m not superhuman 
I’m breaking 
Don’t let me fall apart
