                        Bài hát: Sexyback - Justin Timberlake, Timbaland

[Verse 1] 
I'm bringing sexy back 
Them other boys don't know how to act 
I think it's special what's behind your back 
So turn around and i'll pick up the slack. 
Take em' to the bridge 

[Bridge] 
Dirty babe 
You see these shackles 
Baby I'm your slave 
I'll let you whip me if I misbehave 
It's just that no one makes me feel this way 

Take em' to the chorus 

[Chorus] 
Come here girl 
Go ahead, be gone with it 
Come to the back 
Go ahead, be gone with it 
VIP 
Go ahead, be gone with it 
Drinks on me 
Go ahead, be gone with it 
Let me see what you're working with 
Go ahead, be gone with it 
Look at those hips 
Go ahead, be gone with it 
You make me smile 
Go ahead, be gone with it 
Go ahead child 
Go ahead, be gone with it 
And get your sexy on 
Go ahead, be gone with it 

Get your sexy on 
Go ahead, be gone with it 

[X6] 

Get your sexy on 

[Verse 2] 
I'm bringing sexy back 
Them other boys don't know how to act 
Come let me make up for the things you lack 
Cause your burning up I gotta get it fast 
Take em' to the bridge 

[Bridge] 

[Chorus] 

[Verse 3] 
I'm bringing sexy back 
Them other boys watch while I attack 
If that's your girl you better watch your back 
Cause she'll burn it up for me and that's a fact 

Take em' to the chorus 

[Chorus]
                        
                    |
