                        Aye! Aye!
Teach me how to dougie (aye! )
[Verse 1:]
They be like Smoove (what?)
Can u teach me how to dougie?
You know why?
'Cause all da bitches love me (aye! )
All I need is a beat that's super bumpin'
And for you, you, you to back it up and dump it!
Put your arms out front, lean side to side
They gon' be on you when they see you hit dat dougie right?
Ain't nobody *in' wid my bro from morningside
He go by Bubba and he hit dat dance wid thunder
I ain't from Dallas but I D-town boogie
I show my moves off and errbody tryna do me
I leave da function and all da ladies tryna screw me
You just do you and I'ma do me (all day)
Niggas love to hate so they try to shoot me
Bitches be stuck to me I think they tryna glue me
I make the party shine bright when it's started boomin'
Dis beat was bubblegum so I had to chew it
[Chorus]
Teach me how to dougie
Teach me, teach me how to dougie
Teach me how to dougie
Teach me, teach me how to dougie
All my bitches love me
All my, all my bitches love me
All my bitches love me
You ain't *in wid my dougie! x2
[Verse 2]
My name is yung!
For da dudes who don't know me
I know I'm from da west but I can teach you how to dougie!
Step up in da club and all these bitches bug me
All da niggas dancin', none of them know me
I hear da spot screamin' like "Aye! Get it brody!"
So I'm on my shoulders and I take it real low
Dey like "how you da dat? he can dougie on the floor!"
And when dat nigga stop they like "dougie some mo'!"
I'm like a nigga kinda tired so, I pass it to da bro!
M-bone! show these cats how to do dat down south dance
Dat we learned a lil too fast and bought it to da hood
And got da whole crew askin...
[Chorus]
Teach me how to dougie
Teach me, teach me how to dougie
Teach me how to dougie
Teach me, teach me how to dougie
All my bitches love me
All my, all my bitches love me
All my bitches love me
You aint *in wit my dougie! x2
[Verse 3]
Back of the party I don't really like to boogie
I'm just tryna get bent and meet a thick redbone
(Mmm) she do her dougie and all them bitches hatin' but I'm bout
To escape with a bitch and head home ( * it)
She got her friends so is a two man and
And I wanna run it even if her legs long
She like you hubby, I think she love me but,
I change da subject and I do my dougie
Cuz, I don't give a *, blow trees, get money
Me, smoove, hef in the back with playboy bunnies
We gon' make em do the dougie in the middle of da bed
And when I asked for some head da bitch looked at me funny
Daaah! bitch you can't tell me nothin star make the beat
And I just took it out the oven, I just see the dougie when everybody
Clubbin and I hate skinny jeans cuz the burner keep rubbin!
[Chorus]
Teach me how to dougie
Teach me, teach me how to dougie
Teach me how to dougie
Teach me, teach me how to dougie
All my bitches love me
All my, all my bitches love me
All my bitches love me
You aint *in wit my dougie! x2
