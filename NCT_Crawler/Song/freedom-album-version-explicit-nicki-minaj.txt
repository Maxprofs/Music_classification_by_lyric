                        [Verse:]
 They'll never thank me for opening doors
 But they ain't even thank jesus when he died on the cross
 Cause your spirit is ungrateful, bitches is so hateful, I remain a staple
 My career's been the pink print
 When I retire tell 'em think pink
 Pink friday is the imprint
 And these bitches basic, instinct
 Oh *** my commercial's on
 Did I really body bitches with commercial songs
 Did I really prophecy everything I do
 But before I continue let me thank my crew
 So that was Young Wayne, Mack Maine, Baby and Slim came
 Tez and E. I, told me
 It wouldn't be in vain
 Cause prior to me signing, I could've went insane
 And even now I think do I really want this fame
 Lemme get up and go, 700 to go, overseas for a show
 Everybody get quiet when I'm starting the show
 Man I'm birthing these artists, and I'm starting to show

 (Chrous)
 I feel free, I feel freedom why they mad
 You should see them, burn an L
 Cause it's crazy in here crazy in here crazy in here x2

 Who I wanna work with nobody
 99 percent of them is nobody
 Bitches acting like they killing *** ok
 When I checked these bitches guns nobody
 These niggas is fake fucks and opportunists
 Niggas spend their last dime to say they copped the soonest
 Why these niggas going broke to get ya approval
 Pretty soon they'll be back up on dem ramen noodles
 B-b-bible, queen is the title
 And if you are my rival, then that means you're suicidal
 And if you in the club then it's a young money recital
 I'm just that vital I'm busy never idle
 I'm your idol I'm your idol I'm your muthafucking idol
 Pink friday at macys, thongs and some pasties
 12 mili to kick me feet up
 You ready this is the re up

 I feel free, I feel freedom why the mad
 You should see them, burn an L
 Cause it's crazy in here crazy in here crazy in here x2

 Mirror mirror won't you realize I just have to decide
 What you hiding from
 What you hiding from
 Mirror mirror wont you realize I just have to decide
 What you hiding from
 What you hiding from
 Hiding baby

 Would you would you give you
 Would you would you give you
 Would you would you give you all for you x2

 I feel free, I feel freedom why the mad
 You should see them, burn an L
 Cause it's crazy in here crazy in here crazy in here x2
