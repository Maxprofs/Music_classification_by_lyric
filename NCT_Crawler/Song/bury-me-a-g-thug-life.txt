                        Bury me a G, Thug Life, feel me Thinkin' back, reminiscin' on my teens
 A young G, gettin' paid offa dope fiends
 Fuckin' off cash that I made
 Nigga, what's the sense of workin' hard if you never get to play? I'm hustlin', stayin' out 'til it's dawn
 An' comin' home at 6 o'clock in the mornin'
 Hands on my glock, eyes on the prize
 Finger on the trigger when a nigga ride Shootin' craps, bustin' niggaz out the do'
 Pick my money off the flo', God bless the tre-fo'
 Stuck on full, drunk again
 Sippin' on gin with a couple of friends Say them Thug Life niggaz be like major pimps
 Stickin' to the rules, wasn't made for sin
 An' if I die, let it be
 But when they come for me, bury me a G Say, I ain't got time for bitches
 Gotta keep my mind on my mother***in' riches
 Even when I die, they won't worry me
 Mama, don't cry, bury me a G An' I ain't got time for bitches
 Gotta keep my mind on my mother***in' riches
 Even when I die, they won't worry me
 Mama, don't cry, bury me a G More trouble than the average
 Just made 25 an' I'm livin' like a savage
 Bein' a G, it ain't no easy thing
 'Cause you could *** around, get crossed an' get stuck in the game An' for the rest of your life, you will sit an' reminisce
 Wonder why it had to end like this
 An' to the Gs, you can feel my pain
 Until the mother***er gets born again, bury me a G You thought I was a game, kid
 I'm not the nigga for playin' your games
 I let my buckshots rang when I pull the trigger on my gauge
 I'm on a rampage, makin' runs for the Devil
 Ain't nothin' on my mind but gettin' in some trouble I'm tired of hidin' double-ups from the hold-up
 Just to get a nigga for some blunts, or in some jewelry store
 I gives a ***, niggaz outta luck when I bust
 Put me to my death but I'm a G 'til the enemy could bury me I ain't got time for bitches
 Gotta keep my mind on my mother***in' riches
 Even when I die, they won't worry me
 Mama, don't cry, bury me a G Say, I ain't got time for bitches
 Gotta keep my mind on my mother***in' riches
 Even when I die, they won't worry me
 Mama, don't cry, bury me a G I got nothin' to lose, so I choose to be a killer
 Went from bangin' to slangin', now I'ma dope dealer
 All my life, payed tha price to be the boss
 Back in school, wrote the rules on gettin' tossed Poppin' rocks on the block was a past time
 Pack a 9 all the time, you wanna test mine?
 Don't cry, I'd die before they play me
 From the cradle to the grave, bury me a G Straight Thug G, kickin' it with the homies in the hood
 Gettin' drunk, smokin' blunts, a bitch said I'm no good
 I gives a ***, I spend my time in the dope spot
 Never had no time for no bitch when slangin' rocks An' bustin' caps on you punk ass marks
 Fake-ass Gs, bitch niggaz with no heart
 I'm stayin' real 'til I'm six feet deep
 So when a nigga gone, just bury me a G Ain't got time for bitches
 Gotta keep my mind on my mother***in' riches
 Even when I die, they won't worry me
 Mama, don't cry, bury me a G Say, I ain't got time for bitches
 Gotta keep my mind on my mother***in' riches
 Even when I die, they won't worry me
 Mama, don't cry, bury me a G Stuck on full, Tanqueray got a nigga high
 Lord knows I don't need another D.U.I.
 I live the Thug Life, heartless hustler
 Just 'cause I ***ed, don't mean I trust her Now my pager's vibratin', can't sleep
 So I'm mobbin' to the ho's house, bumpin' Isley
 Is it cool to ***?, is what I'm askin'
 Bitch, recognize game an' start laughin' Now I'm all in the guts an' ***
 Prayin' that a nigga don't nut too quick
 'Cause I'll *** an' get up, I let ya know
 I'll be a ten minute brother for a two-dollar hoe Lots of hoes get mad an' ***
 I let a trick be a trick, you can have that bitch
 'Cause I doubt if I change, the game's a mother***er
 Real niggaz turn to bustas, bury me a G I ain't got time for bitches
 Gotta keep my mind on my mother***in' riches
 Even when I die, they won't worry me
 Mama, don't cry, bury me a G 'Cause I ain't got time for bitches
 Gotta keep my mind on my mother***in' riches
 Even when I die, they won't worry me
 Mama, don't cry, bury me a G Say, I ain't got time for bitches
 Gotta keep my mind on my mother***in' riches
 Even when I die, they won't worry me
 Mama, don't cry, bury me a G Say, I ain't got time for bitches
 Gotta keep my mind on my mother***in' riches
 Even when I die, they won't worry me
 Mama, don't cry, bury me a G 'Cause I ain't got time for bitches
 Gotta keep my mind on my mother***in' riches
 Even when I die, they won't worry me
 Mama, don't cry, bury me a G 'Cause I ain't got time for bitches
 Gotta keep my mind on my mother***in' riches
 Even when I die, they won't worry me

 Now I ain't got time for bitches, bitches
