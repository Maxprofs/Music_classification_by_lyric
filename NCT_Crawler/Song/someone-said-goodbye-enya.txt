                        [ti:Someone Said Goodbye]
[ar:Enya]
[al:]

summer when the day is over
there's a heart a little colder
someone said goodbye
but you don't know why
some where there is someone keeping
all the tears they have been weeping
someone said goodbye
but you don't know why

is there a reason
why a broken heart begins to cry
is there a reason
you were lost although you don't know why
give me a reason
why you never want to say goodbye
if there's a reason
i don't know why

always looking for a meaning
all the time you keep believing
but i don't know why
you won't say goodbye
even when the sun is shining
you don't see the silver lining
but i don't know why
you won't say goodbye

is there a reason
why a broken dream can never fly
is there a reason
you believe and then you close your eyes
give me a reason
why you hide away so much inside
if there's a reason
i don't know why

is there a reason
why a broken heart begins to cry
is there a reason
you were lost although you don't know why
gibe me a reason
why you never want to say goodbye
if there's a reason
i don't know why
i don't know why
i don't know why
i don't know why
