                        "Simply You"

Lyrics: vuonghuu

You're not alpha not omega
You're not New York, you're not Vegas
Simply you
You're not major, you're not minor
You're not L.A., you're much finer
Simply you

I can't paint it, I can't play it
There's no other way to say it
Simply you
I don't care who comprehends it
My whole world begins and ends with
Simply you

You're my train from every station
You're my final destination
Simply you
When I'm losing, when I'm winning
You're in every song I'm singing
Simply you.

I can't paint it, I can't play it
There's no other way to say it
Simply you
I don't care who comprehends it
My whole world begins and ends with
Simply you

You're the dance and you're the dancer
You're the call and you're the answer
Simply you
I don't mean to overstate it,
There's no need to complicate it
Simply you.

I can't paint it, I can't play it
There's no other way to say it
Simply you
I don't care who comprehends it
My whole world begins and ends with
Simply you

I don't care who comprehends it
My whole world begins and ends with
Simply you
Simply you
                        
                    |
