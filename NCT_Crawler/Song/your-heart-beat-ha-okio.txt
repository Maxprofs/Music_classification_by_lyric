                        1. We could have this world . We could buy fancy things  
We could have the fortunes fame n diamond rings 
We could have everything that money can buy  
But what is good if there's no love inside?  

[Chorus:] 
What's in ur heart would u let me know 
If u want more love why dun u say so 
 Nobody knows what the future holds  
Tell me rite now how the story goes 
 What's in ur heart? 

2. No matter where ur from  or when the kingdom come 
No matter what's on my mind until i do it right 
If we ever wonder what's going on . We just dun know 
What we've got til it's gone. 

[ Bridge:] 
 Can not give u what u want 
 Can only give you what u need 
 And i want u 2 know that it's only good 
While stocks last.
