                        Bài hát: I Hate U I Love U - Nightcore

Feeling used
But I'm
Still missing you
And I can't

See the end of this
Just wanna feel your kiss
Against my lips
And now all this time

Is passing by
But I still can't seem to tell you why
It hurts me every time I see you
Realize how much I need you

[Đk:]
I hate you, I love you
I hate that I love you
Don't want to but I can't put nobody else above you

I hate you, I love you
I hate that I want you
You want her, you need her
And I'll never be her

I miss you when I can't sleep
Or right after coffee
Or right when I can't eat
I miss you in my front seat

Still got sand in my sweaters
From nights we don't remember
Do you miss me like I miss you?
Missed around and got attached to you,no

Friends can break your heart too
I'm always tired
But never of you
If I treated you like a, you wouldn't like that

Held out my hand for you,you didn't touch that
I wrote a text but then I delete that
I got these feelings,but you didn't realize that

Ohhh
Keep it on the low
You're still in love with me

But your friends don't know
If you wanted me, you would just say so
If I were you, I would never let me go

[Đk:]
I hate you, I love you
I hate that I love you
Don't want to but I can't put nobody else above you

I hate you, I love you
I hate that I want you
You want her, you need her
And I'll never be her 

So forget that new girl
That you love so bad
I know you still think
About the times we had

I said forget that new girl
That you think you found
And you since you picked up
I know he's not around

I'm just saying you could do better
Tell me have you heard that lately
I'm just saying you could do better
And I'll start hating on me if you make me
                        
                    |
