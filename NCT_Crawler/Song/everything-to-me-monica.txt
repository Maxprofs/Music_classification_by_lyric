                        Boy if you ever left my, my side
 It'd be like taking the sun from the sky
 I'd probably die without you in my life
 'Cus I need you to shine, shine your light You're everything to me, ayyyy
 The air that I breathe, whoa
 I sigh so I see
 Oh that you're, you're everything to me I can't repay you, for all that you've done
 Always come first and second to none
 All that you've given me is equal to ten
 My peace, my joy you are my, my strength You're everything to me, hey
 The air that I breathe, oh
 My sun so I see
 Oh, you're everything to me Boy, I never thought I'd feel love like this
 Better than our first date, sweeter than our first kiss
 And you, ain't no other person for me
 You're my best friend, my lover Baby, you're my everything You're everything to me
 The air that I breathe
 My sun so I see
 You're everything to me Say it I need you
 I need you
 I need you
 I need you
