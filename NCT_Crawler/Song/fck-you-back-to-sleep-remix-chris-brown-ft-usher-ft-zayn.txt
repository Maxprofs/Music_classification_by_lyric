[Intro: Usher]
Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up
Get up, get up, get up, get up
Usher baby
Oooh, oh oh oh
I'm gonna love you, yeah
Baby, oooh, oh oh oh
Soon as I touch you there

[Verse 1: Usher]
Come and ride on me like the waves
I flip the pages cause I wrote the book on the way how to sex you up, sex you up
We can do it like I'm on the stage, we'll have an audience
Baby I'll show you the way that I sex you up or I could lick you up and down 'til you say
You love how I eat on that pussy, just might go put a tat on that pussy
That's says Usher, Usher, there's no other, other
Damn girl, yeah you got that juicy, love when I make you cum, I make it gushy
Don't want any other, other, I'm the champion lover, lover
*** you to sleep, wake you up again, I be so deep in you, beat it up again
Girl come and sit on my tongue again cause I love to taste you yeah
I can tell you been eating your pineapples, girl your pussy taste like pineapples
Girl when I hit your G, you feel like you gon' be, baby cum for me

[Chorus: Chris Brown & Usher]
Just let me rock, *** you back to sleep girl
Don't say a word no, girl don't you talk
Just hold on tight to me girl
*** you back to sleep girl, rock you back

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
Now where you been, it's been a year
Baby I ain't seen you, you know I miss you
Baby let me love you back to sleep once more
And I know we don't speak no more
But I just wanna tell you I'm sorry
For ***ing 'round with Keisha and MaKayla
For all the Georgia peaches in Decatur
For all these bitches in the elevator
I just want you to love me
Yeah baby don't test me
You know I'll do it
You want me to say your name girl?
Okay, Karrueche

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Just let me rock, I'mma *** you back to sleep girl
Oh don't talk to me girl, don't say a word no, girl don't you talk
Just hold on tight to me girl
*** you back to sleep girl and rock you back

[Verse 3: ZAYN]
Baby just stay comfortable, I want you as you are
Baby just lay there naked waiting for me
Let's not get emotional, let's be who we are
Can we do that? Can we do that? Can we?
Know it's been a long day, it's about to be a long night, so keep your eyes closed 'til I roll through
So baby when you're feeling like a women in the sheets
Somebody splitting your knees, don't worry that's me
I'm over here putting work in, baby you ain't gotta tell me what you want

[Chorus: Chris Brown]
Just let me rock and let me love you baby, *** you back to sleep girl, oh
Don't say a word no, don't you talk
Just hold on tight to me girl
*** you back to sleep girl and rock you back

[Outro: Chris Brown]
Ain't sorry that I woke ya, ain't sorry 'bout ya job
Call sick in the morning so I can get a little bit more of your love
Ain't sorry that I woke ya, ain't sorry 'bout ya job
Call sick in the morning so I can get a little bit more of your love
Right back, rock you back
Right back, rock you back
