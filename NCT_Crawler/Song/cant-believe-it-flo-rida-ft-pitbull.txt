                        Intro Flo Rida:
Damn, that white girl got some ass

Chorus Flo Rida:
I can’t believe it
White girl got some ass
I wanna see it,
Black girl got her ass,
It ain’t a secret, baby turn around
I wanna see it, tryna see it, gotta see it

I wanna see that bubble-yum-bum
Baram, bum, baram
Bubble-yum-bum
Baram, bum, baram

Verse 1 Flo Rida:
Uh, I think I found one, cause I got that fever
Britney got herself a round one
Ass like Serena, that’s ok cause I love my stereotypes
My girls in tools, that maximum exposure rolls into what I wanna do
Tell a load of Girls, all around the world my last name must be Robins
Cause I’m baskin’ in all these asses, all 31 flavors keep calling
My, my, my vanilla Cinderella loved when I tell her drop it
My butter pecan breathing but, but I love my chocolate

Chorus Flo Rida:
I can’t believe it
White girl got some ass
I wanna see it,
Black girl got her ass,
It ain’t a secret, baby turn around
I wanna see it, tryna see it, gotta see it

I wanna see that bubble-yum-bum
Baram, bum, baram
Bubble-yum-bum
Baram, bum, baram
Bubble-yum-bum
Baram, bum, baram
Bubble-yum-bum
Baram, bum, baram

Verse 2 Pitbull:
She got that ba-donka-donka-donk-donk
Dang so fat, dang so chunky
Call me Michael Jackson, hi-hi-hi
Cause I love to play with monkeys
This is my everything, that’s right
We down for anything, that’s right
You down everything, that’s right
So ride a Pitbull handy-dang
I’m off the changa-lang-lang
Girl that’s how you can get king
Mira salinga, con todas ...
Commo stay, estas loco
... poco, mami muevelo coco
I don’t care where you’re from
As long as you got that bum

Chorus Flo Rida:
I can’t believe it
White girl got some ass
I wanna see it,
Black girl got her ass,
It ain’t a secret, baby turn around
I wanna see it, tryna see it, gotta see it

Outro Flo Rida:
I turn left, turn right
Turn around, you can tell what I like
She looked good, she so bad sarkisozu.info...
She pick it up, drop it down, look back
