                        Bài hát: Tell Laura I Love Her - Ray Peterson

Tommy and Laura were lovers he wanted to give here everything Flowers presents and most of all a wedding ring He saw a sign for a stockcar race a thousand dollar prize it read He couldn''t get Laura on the phone so to her mother Tommy said Tell Laura I love her tell Laura I need her Tell Laura I may be late I''ve something to do that cannot wait He drove his car to the racing ground he was the youngest driver there The crowd roared as they started to race Around the truck they drove at a deadly pace No one knows what happened that day how his car overturned in flames But as they pulled him from the twisted wreck With his dying breath they heard him say Tell Laura I love her tell Laura I need her Tell Laura not to cry my love for her will never die Now in the chapel Laura prays for her Tommy who passed away It was just for Laura that he lived and died alone in the chapel she can hear him cry Tell Laura I love her... My love for her will never die
