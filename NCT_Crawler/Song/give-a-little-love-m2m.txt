                        V1
Everytime I think I've had enough of you
I take you back again
Not because I need a friend
Just because I can't pretend
Like the others do
You think you're really serious
Clever and mysterious
Talking like you're dangerous
Talking like a fool

V2
Every day there's someone else
Who wants to get with me
I'm telling you
If you know what's good for you
Treat me like you used to do
Love me like before


B-sec
'cos all I can do is watch and wonder
Where the boy I know has gone
You say that you want me, well it's
Time to tell your friends where they belong

Chorus
You can find it in your heart
Give a little love
Have a little faith
In the two of us
You can find it in your soul
Give a little love
Have a little faith
In the two of us
'cos all I can do is watch and wonder
Where the boy I know has gone

V3
Little boy I don't want anything to do with you
Get on your knees
I'm the one you have to please
Not the ones you want to be
I don't think you're cool

B-sec
'cos soon you can only watch and wonder
Where the girl you knew has gone
And then you will realise that
Everything you did to me was wrong

Chorus
'cos soon you can only watch and wonder

Bridge
And do you really wanna lose a friend
You gotta understand or it has to end
'cos I don't wanna wait for you anymore
Can't take it anymore

Chorus
