                        Bài hát: Black Magic - Little Mix

All the girls on the block knocking at my door
Wanna know what it is make the boys want more

Is your lover
Playing on your side
Said he loves you
But he ain't got time
Here's the answer
Come and get it
At a knocked down price
Full of honey
Just to make him sweet
Crystal ballin'
Just to help him see what he's been missing
So come and get it
While you still got time
Get your boy on his knees and repeat me after me say

Take a sip of my secret potion
I'll make you fall in love
For a spell that can't be broken
One drop should be enough
Boy you belong to me
I got the recipe
And it’s called black magic (and it’s called black magic)
Take a sip of my secret potion
One taste and you'll be mine
It's a spell that can't be broken
It'll keep you up all night
Boy you belong to me
I got the recipe
And it’s called black magic (and it’s called black magic)

If you're looking
For Mr. Right
Need that magic
To change him overnight
Here's the answer
Come and get it
While you still got time
Get your boy on his knees and repeat me after me say

Take a sip from my secret potion
I'll make you fall in love
For a spell that can't be broken
One drop should be enough
Boy you belong to me
I got the recipe
And it’s called black magic (and it’s called black magic)
Take a sip from my secret potion
One taste and you'll be mine
It's a spell that can't be broken
It'll keep you up all night
Boy you belong to me
I got the recipe
And it’s called black magic (and it’s called black magic)

All the girls on the block knocking at my door
(i got the recipe)
Wanna know what it is make the boys want more
(now you belong to me)
