                        Bài hát: Quit - Lany

Can you chill stop freaking out for a second
'Cause it's hard to think when you're losing your mind
And I know that you've got like 10,000 questions
And to be real I actually don't have time

'Cause we could fight all day about the future
But I don't even know where I'll be next week
Or we could hang all day forget the future
I'm here right now just be here right now with me

Quit running away you're running outta room
You and I know that's not what you wanna do
Quit running away quit running away

You've been hurt but come on nobody's perfect
And I'm tired of hearing how they did ya wrong
'Cause I'm not them you're not with them can we drop it
How good would it be if you'd just move on

'Cause we could fight all day about the future
But I don't even know where I'll be next week
Or we could dance all night forget the future
I'm here right now just be here right now with me

Quit running away you're running outta room
You and I know that's not what you wanna do
Quit running away quit running away

'Cause we could fight all day about the future
But I don't even know where I'll be next week
Or we could hang all day forget the future
I'm here right now just be here right now with me

Quit running away you're running outta room
You and I know that's not what you wanna do
Quit running away quit running away

I won't let ya quit
I won't let ya quit
I won't let ya quit on me
                        
                    |
