                        Bài hát: Say You Love Me Beat - M.Y.M.P.Don't you know that I want to be more than just your friend
Holding hands is fine
But I've got better things on my mind
You know it could happen
If you'd only see me in a different light
Baby when we finally get together
You will see that I was right

Say you love me
You know that it could be nice
If you'd only say you love me
Don't treat me like I was ice

Please love me
I'll be yours and you'll be mine
And if you'd only say you love me baby
Things would really work out fine

Don't you know that I want to be more than just your friend
Holding hands is fine
But I've got better things on my mind
You know it could happen
If you'd only see me in a different light
But baby when we finally get together
You will see that I was right

Say you love me
You know that it could be nice
If you'd only say you love me
And don't treat me like I was ice

Oh please love me
I'll be yours and you'll be mine
And if you'd only say you love me baby
Things would really work out fine

Say you love me
You know that it could be nice
If you'd only say you love me
And don't treat me like I was ice

Oh please love me
I'll be yours and you'll be mine
And if you'd only say you love me baby
Things would really work out fine
And if you'd only say you love me darling
Things would really work out fine
