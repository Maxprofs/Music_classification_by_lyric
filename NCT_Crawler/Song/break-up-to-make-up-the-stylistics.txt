                        Tell me whats wrong with you now
 Tell me why I
 Never seem to make ya happy
 Though heaven knows I've tried
 What does it take to please you
 Tell me just how
 I can satisfy ya woman your drivin me wild

 Chorus
 Break up to make up that's all we do
 First you love me, then you hate me
 That's a game for fools
 Break up to make up that's all we do
 First you love me, then you hate me
 That's a game for fools

 When I come home for working
 Your on the phone
 Talkin' bout how bad I treat ya
 Now tell me I'm wrong
 You say it's me and always
 I say its you
 We have got to get together or baby we're through

 Chorus x 2
