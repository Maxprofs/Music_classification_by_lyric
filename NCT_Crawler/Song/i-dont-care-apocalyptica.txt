                        I try to make it through my life 
In my way 
There's you 
I try to make it through these lies 
That's all I do 

Just don't deny it 
Just don't deny it 
And deal with it 
Yeah, Deal with it 

You try to break me 
You wanna break me 
Bit by bit 
That's just part of it 

If you were dead or still alive 
I don't care 
I don't care 
And all the things you left behind 
I don't care 
I don't care 

I try to make you see my side 
I Always try to stay in line 
But your eyes see right through 
That's all they do 
I'm getting tired of this * 
I got no room when it's like this 
But you order me 
just deal with it! 

So 

If you were dead or still alive 
I don't care 
I don't care 
And all the things you left behind 
I don't care 
I don't care 

[Cello Solo] 

(If you won't be there for me, You won't be there for me) 
(If you won't be there for me, You won't be there for me) 

[Piano Solo] 

If you were or dead or still alive 
I don't care 
I don't care 
And all the things you left behind 
I don't care 
I don't care 

If you were dead or still alive 
I don't care 
(If you won't be there for me, You won't be there for me) 
I don't care 
And all the things you left behind 
I don't care 
(You won't be there for me) 
I don't care 
At all
