                        Bài hát: Love Me Like You (CDQ) - Chris Rene

Feeling like a soldier in a one man army
Cold and alone and baby I'm hardly sleeping
Middle of the night wake up in a cold sweat
Calling out your name but I know that I'm hopeless
Dreaming, ohh ohh ohh

[Pre-Chorus]
You got that ass you got that swag
You got that *** I need so bad
You got that, you got that
That all them other girls don't have
You got that, you got that moves
And every single thing you do
Is like woo oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

[Chorus]
So if you wanna know now
I could bear the load down
See ain't no other girl out there
That could love me, like like you like you
I miss the way you ride me
We used to do it nightly
Ain't no other girl out there
That could love me, like like you like you
That could love me like you

[Verse]
Feels like I'm moving but I'm driving in circles
Never knew losing you was really gonna hurt so deeply
Now all these other girls in the world don't compare to
How you walk, how you talk girl you so real
I mean it, oh woo woo woo

[Pre-Chorus]
You got that ass you got that swag
You got that *** I need so bad
You got that, you got that
That all them other girls don't have
You got that, you got that moves
And every single thing you do
Is like woo oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

[Chorus]
So if you wanna know now
I could bear the load down
See ain't no other girl out there
That could love me, like like you like you
I miss the way you ride me
We used to do it nightly
Ain't no other girl out there
That could love me, like like you like you
That could love me like you

[Bridge]
You need to know the way I feel
My nights are long the pain is real
I call your name but no one's there
You got me going out my mind
Since the very day you disappeared

[Chorus]
So if you wanna know now
I could bear the load down
See ain't no other girl out there
That could love me, like like you like you
I miss the way you ride me
We used to do it nightly
Ain't no other girl out there
That could love me, like like you like you
That could love me like you

I miss the way you ride me
We used to do it nightly
Ain't no other girl out there
That could love me, like like you like you
That could love me like you
That could love me like you
That could love me like you
That could love me like you
That could love me like you
That could love me like you
