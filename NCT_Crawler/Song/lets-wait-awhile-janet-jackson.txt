《Let\'s Wait A While》

√Edited By CrazyXP√
There\'s something I want to tell you
There\'s something I think that you should know
It\'s not that I shouldn\'t really love you
Let\'s take it slow
When we get to know each other
And we\'re both feeling much stronger
Then let\'s try to talk it over
Let\'s wait a while longer
Let\'s wait a while before it\'s too late
Let\'s wait a while before we go too far

Remember that special night
When all of the stars were shining bright
We made our first endeavor to stay together
We made our very first promise
To love, to share, and be real honest
But on that very first night
It wasn\'t quite right

Let\'s wait a while before it\'s too late
Let\'s wait a while our love will be great
Let\'s wait a while before we go too far

I didn\'t really know not to let all my feelings show
To save some for later so our love can be greater
You said you would (always love me)
Remember I said the same thing too
You don\'t have to be frightened with my love
(Because) I\'ll never give up on you
Let\'s wait a while
A while before it\'s too late
You know can\'t rush love, love
Let\'s wait a while before it\'s too late
Let\'s wait a while our love will be great
Let\'s wait a while before we go too far
Let\'s wait a while before it\'s too late
Let\'s wait a while our love will be great
Let\'s wait a while
