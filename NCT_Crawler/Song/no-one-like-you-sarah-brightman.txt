[00:-0.50]Sarah Brightman--No one like you
And wo too
will it not be soft and kind
That rest from life,from patience and from pain
That rest from bliss,wo know not when we find
How can I have enough of life and love
In your eyes are my secrets
that I've never shown you
In my heart feel
l've always known you
In your arms there's a comffort
that I never knew
You're what I've been waiting for
There's no one like you
Sure as sunrise
pure as a prayer
You fashioned hope right of the air
Ev'ry dream I abandoned
seems it could come true
I believe in miracles,
there's no one like you
innocent as a newborn
in a world so fright'ning
it's as if my world's been struck by lightning
Ev'ry dream I abandoned
seems it could come true
I belive in miracles
there's no on like you
                        
                    |
