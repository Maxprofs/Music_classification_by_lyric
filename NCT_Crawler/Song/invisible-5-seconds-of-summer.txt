                        Bài hát: Invisible - 5 Seconds Of Summer

Another day
Of painted walls and football on the TV
No one sees me
I fade away
Lost inside a memory of someone's life
It wasn't mine
I was already missing

Before the night I left
Just me and my shadow and all of my regrets
Who am I? Who am I?
When I don't know myself
Who am I? Who am I?
Invisible

Wasted days
Dreaming of the times I know I can't get back
It seems I just lost track
Looking on
As all of life's colors seem to fade to grey
I just walked away
I was already missing

Before the night I left
Just me and your shadow and all of my regrets
Who am I? Who am I?
When I don't know myself
Who am I? Who am I?
Invisible

Who am I? Who am I?
When I don't know myself
Who am I? Who am I?
Invisible
Who am I? Who am I?
When I don't know myself?

Who am I? Who am I?
Invisible
Another day
The walls are built to keep me safe, I can't escape
It's too late
                        
                    |
