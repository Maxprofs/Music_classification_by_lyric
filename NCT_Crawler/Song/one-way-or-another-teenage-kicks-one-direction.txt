I'm gonna get you get you get you get you
One way or another I'm gonna win you
I'm gonna get you get you get you get you
One way or another I'm gonna see you
I'm gonna meet you meet you meet you meet you
One day, maybe next week
I'm gonna meet you, I'm gonna meet you, I'll meet you
I will drive past your house
And if the lights are all down
I'll see who's around

One way or another I'm gonna win you
I'll get you I'll get you
One way or another I'm gonna see you

And if the lights are all out
I'll follow your bus downtown
See who's hanging out

I wanna meet you meet you meet you meet you
One way or another I'm gonna win you
I'm gonna get you get you get you get you

One way or another I'm gonna win you
I'm gonna get you get you get you get you one way or another
