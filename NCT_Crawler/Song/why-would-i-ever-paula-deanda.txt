                        [Intro]
Why would I ever think of leaving you
Why would I ever think of leaving you


[1st Verse]
Wait a minute baby
Tell me what's up lately
I been knowin' you too long

I gotta get this out of my chest
Girl I put you in a test
Cause I listen to these sad songs

How could you ever think that
I wouldn't have your back
It's me and you against the world

If I told you that I love you
No matter what we do
Promise to be girl.........


[Chorus]
We're never stoppin like the beat of my heart
No turnin back now that we came so far
Why would I ever wanna push you away
When the only one I'm pullin is you

Why would I ever think of leaving you
Why would I ever think of leaving you


[2nd Verse]
Wait a minute hold up
J said when you rolled up
You was yellin' off the chain

Wait a minute hold up
Brush off my shoulda
I was at the top of my game

Now we been through some problems
Trust me we solve them
We got too much in it to lose

Too much in it to prove there is nothin
I gotta tell you somthin
Baby Imma do it for you (you) for you (you) hey....


[Chorus]
We're never stoppin like the beat of my heart
No turnin back now that we came so far
Why would I ever wanna push you away
When the only one I'm pullin is you

Why would I ever think of leaving you
Why would I ever think of leaving you

[3rd Verse]
Tell me why did you ever question
(Question everything we stand for)
Between us (We got that)
Have you seen us
We got that love

[Following 3rd Verse]
She tried to hold it down, I wanna hold it up
And if things get too hot, then maybe I will self destruct
And when I drop the dice
Its like I'm gamblin in every situation frozen, Im feelin cold as ice
Baby lets take it slow, dont wanna crash today
Cause if I take a shortcut, you know we feelin like.....
(Ah ah)
We makin it (Rock rock)
We takin it (Top top)
Dont makin it (Stop stop)
Oh baby.....

[Outro]

Why would I ever think of leaving you
Why would I ever think of leaving you
