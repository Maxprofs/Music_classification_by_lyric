                        Bài hát: Symphony Cover - J.Fla

I’ve been hearing symphonies 
Before all I heard was silence 
A rhapsody for you and me 
And every melody is timeless 
Life was stringing me along 
Then you came and you cut me loose 
Was solo singing on my own 
Now I can’t find the key without you 

[Pre-Chorus: Zara Larsson] 
And now your song is on repeat 
And I’m dancin' on to your heartbeat 
And when you’re gone, I feel incomplete 
So if you want the truth 

[Chorus: Zara Larsson] 
I just wanna be part of your symphony 
Will you hold me tight and not let go? 
Symphony 
Like a love song on the radio 
Will you hold me tight and not let go? 

[Verse 2: Zara Larsson] 
I’m sorry if it’s all too much 
Every day you’re here, I’m healing 
And I was runnin' out of luck 
I never thought I’d find this feeling 
'Cause I’ve been hearing symphonies 
Before all I heard was silence 
A rhapsody for you and me 
(A rhapsody for you and me) 
And every melody is timeless 

[Pre-Chorus: Zara Larsson] 
And now your song is on repeat 
And I’m dancin' on to your heartbeat 
And when you’re gone, I feel incomplete 
So if you want the truth 

[Chorus: Zara Larsson] 
I just wanna be part of your symphony 
Will you hold me tight and not let go? 
Symphony 
Like a love song on the radio 
Will you hold me tight and not let go?
                        
                    |
