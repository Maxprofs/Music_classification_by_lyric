                        Bài hát : Riser - Dierks Bentley

Lay your pretty head down on my shoulder
You don't have to worry anymore
This old world is cold and getting colder
And I know how to lock and bolt the door

I'm strong enough to hold you through the winter
Mean enough to stare your demons down
The hard times put the shine into the diamond
I won't let that keep us in the ground

I'm a riser
I'm a get off of the ground, don't run and hider
Pushin' comes to shove
Hey I'm a fighter
When darkness comes to town, I'm a lighter
A get out aliver, of the fire
Survivor

If we ain't got no money I can make it
And I ain't afraid of working to the bone
When I don't know what I'm doin' I can fake it
I'll pray 'til Jesus rolls away the stone

I'm a riser
I'm a get off of the ground, don't run and hider
When pushin' comes to shove
Hey I'm a fighter
When darkness comes to town, I'm a lighter
A get out aliver, of the fire
Survivor

I'm a trier
I'm a get down low so I can lift you higher
An army couldn't keep down my desire
Yeah

I'm a riser
I'm a get off of the ground, don't run and hider
Hey pushin' comes to shove
And baby I'm a fighter
When darkness comes to town, I'm a lighter
Get out aliver, of the fire
Survivor, I'm a riser

I'm a riser
I'm a riser
I'm a riser
I'm a riser
