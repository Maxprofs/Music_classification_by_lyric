                        It's been so long
That I haven't seen your face
I'm trying to be strong
But the strength I have is washing away

It won't be long
Before I get you by my side
And just hold you, tease you, squeeze you
Tell you what's been on my mind

I wanna make up right now na na
I wanna make up right now na na
Wish we never broke up right now na na
We need to link up right now

I wanna make up right now na na
I wanna make up right now na na
Wish we never broke up right now na na
We need to link up right now na na

Girl I know mistakes were made between us two
And we show our eyes that night
Even said some things weren't true

Why'd you go and haven't seen my girl since then
Why can't it be the way it was?
'Cause you were my homie, lover, and friend

I wanna make up right now na na
I wanna make up right now na na
Wish we never broke up right now na na
We need to link up right now na na

I wanna make up right now na na
I wanna make up right now na na
Wish we never broke up right now na na
We need to link up right now na na

I can't lie, I miss you much
Watching everyday that goes by, I miss you much
Until I get you back I'm gonna try, yes I miss you much
'Cause you are the apple of my eye, girl I miss you much

I miss you much I can't lie, I miss you much
Watching everyday that goes by, I miss you much
Until I get you back I'm gonna try, yes I miss you much
'Cause you are the apple of my eye, girl I miss you much

I miss you much, I wanna make up right now na na
I wanna make up right now na na
Wish we never broke up right now na na
We need to link up right now

I wanna make up right now na na
I wanna make up right now na na
Wish we never broke up right now na na
We need to link up right now na na
