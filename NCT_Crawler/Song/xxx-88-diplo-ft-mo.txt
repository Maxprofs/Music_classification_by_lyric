                        Bài hát: XXX 88 - MO, Diplo

I feel the water flow as I watch him go
Boy, life is cynical despite my heart of gold
Oh, no, buddy, don't you cry as they go
Life changes all of us, it's not your fault
No, no, no, no

Why did they all run dreams?
OH, THE SKY IS BLUE FOREVER

OH, THE SKY IS BLUE FOREVER

They disappeared, it's this that you know
Who's gonna care if my breathing shows?
Take a run, take a run at me
OH, THE SKY IS BLUE FOREVER

Till the end of time

Buddy, don't you cry when she goes
Cause life is cynical despite your heart of gold
Oh, no, buddy, don't you cry as they go
Life makes us critical and all we gotta change about it

Why did they all run dreams?
OH, THE SKY IS BLUE FOREVER

OH, THE SKY IS BLUE FOREVER

They disappeared, it's this that you know
Who's gonna care if my breathing shows?
Take a run, take a run at me
OH, THE SKY IS BLUE FOREVER

We never, we never, we never
OH, THE SKY IS BLUE FOREVER

Why did they all run dreams?
OH, THE SKY IS BLUE FOREVER

Why did they all run dreams?
OH, THE SKY IS BLUE FOREVER

They disappeared, it's this that you know
Who's gonna care if my breathing shows?
Take a run, take a run at me

They disappeared, it's this that you know
Who's gonna care if my breathing shows?
Take a run, take a run at me
OH, THE SKY IS BLUE FOREVER
