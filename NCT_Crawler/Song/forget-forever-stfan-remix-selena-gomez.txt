                        I told, I told, I told myself again
 I'm never runnin' back on what I said
 Tryin' not to run but you're so far away, so far away
 Won't listen to the conscience in my head
 I'm conscious but I'm lonely halfway dead
 Tired of the thing you never, you never said
 You never said

 [Chorus:]
 Our love was made to rule the world
 You came and broke the perfect girl
 Our love was made to rule the world
 Our love was made to rule the world
 You left wanting what we were
 Our love was made to rule the world

 [Beat break]

 Forget forever, forget forever
 Forget you ever knew my name, my name, my name, my name

 I know, I know, I know we can't pretend that we never lovers in the end
 I've tried to tell myself this pain would go away
 Just go away

 [Chorus:]
 Our love was made to rule the world
 You came and broke the perfect girl
 Our love was made to rule the world
 Our love was made to rule the world,
 You left wanting what we were
 Our love was made to rule the world

 [Beat break]

 Forget forever, forget forever
 Forget you ever knew my name, my name, my name, my name
 Forget forever
 Forget forever
                        
                    |
