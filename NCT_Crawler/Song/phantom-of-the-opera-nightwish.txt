                        Bài hát: Phantom Of The Opera - Nightwish

[christine (tarja):]
In sleep he sang to me, in dreams he came,
That voice which calls to me,
And speaks my name.
And do i dream again? For now i find
The phantom of the opera is there
Inside my mind.

[phantom (marco):]
Sing once again with me our strange duet;
My power over you grows stronger yet.
And though you turn from me to glance behind,
The phantom of the opera is there
Inside your mind.

[christine (tarja):]
Those who have seen your face
Draw back in fear.
I am the mask you wear,

[phantom (marco):]
It's me they hear.

[christine (tarja) & phantom (marco):]
Your spirit and my voice in one combined;
The phantom of the opera is there
Inside my/your mind.

[voices:]
He's there the phantom of the opera.
Beware the phantom of the opera.

[phantom (marco):]
In all your fantasies, you always knew
That man and mystery

[christine (tarja):]
Were both in you.

[christine (tarja) & phantom (marco):]
And in this labyrinth where night is blind,
The phantom of the opera is here
Inside my/your mind.

[phantom (marco):]
Sing, my angel of music!
