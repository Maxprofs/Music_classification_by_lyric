                        Bài hát: We Are Young (Glee Cast Version) - Glee Cast

[Rachel:]
Give me a second, I, I need to get my story straight
My friends are in the bathroom getting higher than the Empire State
My lover he’s waiting for me just across the bar
My seat’s been taken by some sunglasses asking bout a scar, and

[Finn:]
I know I gave it to you months ago
I know you’re trying to forget
But between the drinks and subtle things
The holes in my apologies, you know
I’m trying hard to take it back

[Sam:]
So if by the time the bar closes

[Sam and Quinn:]
And you feel like falling down
I’ll carry you home

[Finn, Rachel and New Directions:]
Tonight
We are young
So let’s set the world on fire
We can burn brighter than the sun

[Santana, Mercedes, Brittany and Sugar:]
Tonight
We are young
So let’s set the world on fire
We can burn brighter than the sun

[Santana:]
Now I know that I'm not all that you got
I guess that I
I just thought maybe we could find new ways to fall apart

[Rachel:]
But our friends are back
So let's raise a cup
'Cause I found someone to carry me home

[Finn w/ New Directions:]
Tonight
We are young
So let’s set the world on fire
We can burn brighter than the sun

[Mercedes:]
Whoa

[New Directions w/ The Trouble Tones:]
Tonight
We are young
So let’s set the world on fire
We can burn brighter than the sun

[Quinn w/ New Directions]
Carry me home tonight (Nananananana)
Just carry me home tonight (Nananananana)
Carry me home tonight (Nananananana)
Just carry me home tonight (Nananananana)

[New Directions Boys:]
The world is on my side
I have no reason to run
So will someone come and carry me home tonight

[Santana:]
The angels never arrived
But I can hear the choir
So will someone come and carry me home

[Rachel:]
Tonight
We are young
So let’s set the world on fire
We can burn brighter than the sun

[Mercedes:]
We are young, yeah

[New Directions:]
Tonight
We are young
So let’s set the world on fire
We can burn brighter than the sun

[Rachel and Finn:]
So if by the time the bar closes
And you feel like falling down
I’ll carry you home tonight
                        
                    |
