                        Bài hát: You're The One That I Want - John Travolta, Olivia Newton-John

I got chills, they're multiplying
And I'm losing control
'Cause the power, you're supplying
It's electrifying!

You better shape up, 'cause I need a man
And my heart is set on you
You better shape up, you better understand
To my heart I must be true
Nothing left, nothing left for me to do

You're the one that I want
You are the one I want
Oo,Oo,Oo honey

You're the one that I want

You are the one I want
Oo, Oo, Oo honey

You're the one that I want
You are the one I want
Oo, Oo, Oo, the one that I need
Oh yes indeed

If you're filled with affection
You're too shy to convey
Meditate my direction
Feel your way

I better shape up, 'cause you need a man
I need a man who can keep me satisfied
I better shape up, if I'm gonna prove
You better prove that my faith is justified
Are you sure? Yes I'm sure down deep inside

You're the one that I want
You are the one I want
Oo, Oo, Oo honey

You're the one that I want
You are the one I want
Oo, Oo, Oo honey

You're the one that I want
You are the one I want
Oo, Oo, Oo, the one that I need
Oh yes indeed

You're the one that I want
You are the one I want
Oo, Oo, Oo honey

You're the one that I want
You are the one I want
Oo, Oo, Oo honey

You're the one that I want
You are the one I want
Oo, Oo, Oo, the one that I need
Oh yes indeed

You're the one that I want
You are the one I want
Oo, Oo, Oo honey

You're the one that I want
You are the one I want
Oo, Oo, Oo honey

You're the one that I want
You are the one I want
Oo, Oo, Oo, the one that I need
Oh yes indeed

You're the one that I want
You are the one I want
Oo, Oo, Oo honey

You're the one that I want
                        
                    |
