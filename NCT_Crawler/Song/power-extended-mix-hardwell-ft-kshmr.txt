                        Bài hát: Power - Hardwell, KSHMR

[Verse 1] 
I feel you up in bones that can't ever break 
Take you to a darker shade of grey 
Warm you like a sun that will never fade 
Oooh, ooh 

[Chorus] 
This is power, This is power 
This is power, This is power, power, power 
Power 
This is power, This is power 
This is power, This is power, power, power 

[Verse 2] 
I'll give you every heart of a hundred souls 
You could be the fire to kill the cold 
I'll break you like a rock that could never hold 
Oooh, ooh 

[Pre-Chorus] 
This is power, This is power 
This is power, This is power, power, power 
This is power, power, power 

[Chorus] 
Power 
This is power, This is power 
This is power, This is power, power, power
                        
                    |
