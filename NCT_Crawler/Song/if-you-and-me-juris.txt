                        Here I am, standing close to you. And it tells so far away 
Some many times, I try to say, but my heart was afraid 
Look at you, it’s all that I can do 
Like a silly girl I stare 
'Cause you might leave me when I reveal 
What my heart is really feeling. 

If I could just say the words 
All the secrets in my heart and in my soul you hear 
Will you take me in your arms or let me go, a lovely day
Will they just face like a whisper in the wind 

If I could just say the words 
All the secrets in my heart and in my soul you hear
Can you see the love I hide, slip through my eyes 
This silly girl so scare. She just can say I love you 

Here I am, holding on to faith. What we have might never change 
Cause you might leave me when I reveal 
My lips will see the love I’m hiding 

If I could just say the worlds 
All the secrets in my heart and in my soul you hear 
Will you take me in your arms or let me go, a lovely day 
Will they just face like a whisper in the wind 

If I could just say the worlds 
All the secrets in my heart and in my soul you hear 
Can you see the love I hide, slip through my eyes 
This silly girl so scare. She just can say I love you

If I could just say the worlds 
All the secrets in my heart and in my soul you hear 
Can you see the love I hide, slip through my eyes 
This silly girl so scare. She just can say I love you...
