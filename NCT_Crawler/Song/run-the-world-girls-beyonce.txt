Some of them men think they freak this like we do
But no they don't
Make your cheque come at they neck
Disrespect us no they won't

This goes out to all my girls that's in the club rocking the latest
Who could buy it for themselves and get more money later
I think I need a barber
None of these bitches can fade me
I'm so good with this
I remind you i'm so hood with this

Boy i'm just playing
Come here baby
Hope you still like me
If you hate me
My persuasion can build a nation
Endless power our love we can devour
You'll do anything for me

It's hot up in here DJ don't be scared to run this run this back
I'm repping for the girls who're taking over the world have me raise a glass for the college grats
This goes out to all the women getting it in get on your grind
To other men that respect what I do please accept my shine
Boy you know you love it how we're smart enough to make these millions
Strong enough to bear the children then get back to bidness
You better not play me oh come here baby
Hope you still like me if you hate me

Endless power our love we can devour
You'll do anything for me
