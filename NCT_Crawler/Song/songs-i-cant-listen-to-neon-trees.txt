                        Bài hát: Songs I Can’t Listen To - Neon Trees

There's a song that I love that you once played for me
It had all the right chords, and a sweet melody
It was back when we started, when there was mystery
Now they've all erased my music machine

And it's all because of you
I got a list of songs I can't listen to
And it's all because we're through
I got a list of songs I can't listen to

And do you feel singing alone when you're all by yourself
Or do you switch to the next one, sing for somebody else
When you call don't forget how the song get this warm
You would dance in my bed, I would lay in your arms

And it's all because of you
I got a list of songs I can't listen to
And it's all because we're through
I got a list of songs I can't listen to

And I wished the music didn't played forever
Cuz i'm feeling like a broken record
And I wished the music didn't played forever
Cuz I'm feeling like a broken record

And it's all because of you
I got a list of songs I can't listen to
And it's all because we're through
I got a list of songs I can't listen to
And it's all because of you
I got a list of songs I can't listen to
And it's all because we're through
I got a list of songs I can't listen to
                        
                    |
