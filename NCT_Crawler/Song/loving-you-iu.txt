                        Bài hát: Loving You - IU

Loving you is easy cause you're beautiful.
Making love with you is all I want to do.
Loving you is more than just a dream come true.
And everything I do, is out of loving you
La la la la la, la la la la la
La la la la la, la la la la la
Do do do do do, ooh

No one else can make me feel the colours that you bring
Stay with me while we grow old
And we will live each day in spring time.
Cause loving you has made my life so beautiful.
And every day of my life, is filled with loving you.
Loving you I see your soul come shining through.

And every time that we have (uuuuhhhhhhh)
I'm more in love with you.
La la la la la, la la la la la
La la la la la, la la la la la
Do do do do do, ooh

No one else can make me feel the colours that you bring
Stay with me while we grow old
And we will live each day in spring time.
Cause loving you is easy cause you're beautiful.
And everyday of my life is filled with loving you

Loving you I see your soul come shining through.
And every time that we have (uuuuhhhhhhh)
I'm more in love with you.
La la la la la, la la la la la
La la la la la, la la la la la

Do do do do do, ooh
Loving you
La la la la la, la la la la la
Do do do do do
Dee do, dee do, dee do
