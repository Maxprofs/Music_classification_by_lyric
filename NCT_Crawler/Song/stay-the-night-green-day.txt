                        I haven't got much time so I'll get to the point
You wanna share a ride and get the * out of this joint
I got an impulse so impulsive that it burns
I wanna break your heart until it makes your stomach churn

I gotta know that you're the one that got away
Even though it was never meant to be

So stay, stay the night
Cause we're runnin' out of time
so stay the night
I don't wanna say goodbye
Stay, stay the night
Cause we're runnin' out of time
So stay the night
I don't want to say goodbye

I'm just sick and tired of feeling so alone
Well, I don't understand the point if you got to go home
why won't you stay and cure the circles round my eyes
and we can watch the stars until the sun begins to rise

I gotta know that you're the one that got away
Even though it was never meant to be

So stay, stay the night
Cause we're runnin' out of time
So stay the night
I don't wanna say goodbye
Stay, stay the night
Cause we're runnin' out of time
So stay the night
I don't want to say goodbye
