Ingrid Michaelson - End Of The World
By Novona He
When the sun runs out
And there's no one to save you
Will you go to our favorite place
And try to say goodbye?
At the end of, at the end of the world
Will you find me, will you find me?
At the end of, at the end of the world
Will you find me so that we can go
Together, together, together

When the moon breaks up
And the tide goes out of control
Will you find me in the water
And swim me to the stars?
At the end of, at the end of the world
Will you find me, will you find me?
At the end of, at the end of the world
Will you find me so that we can go
Together, together, together
Together, together, together
Together, together, together
When the sun breaks up
And there's no one to save you
At the end of, at the end of the world
Will you find me, will you find me?
At the end of, at the end of the world
Will you find me, will you find me?
Will you find me, will you find me?
