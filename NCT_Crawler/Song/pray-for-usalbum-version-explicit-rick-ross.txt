                        Come on let's pray

 Dear Lord
 Please forgive us for all the sins we have brought upon us
 And look down upon us with forgiveness for all the sins we will have in the
 Future
 I know you understand that brothers ain't perfect
 But we try, Lord
 We try to keep our heads up in bad times
 This is a bad time
 Show us the way
 And if You can't show us the way
 Then forgive us for being lost
                        
                    |
