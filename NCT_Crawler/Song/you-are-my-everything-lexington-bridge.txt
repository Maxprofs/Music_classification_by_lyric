                        Baby I can’t let you go
I think you about you all the time
Think about you all the nights
You and me we creepin’ next to the sea
You brought the fresh champagne
And I’d light the fire
Sometimes I really ask myself
Do you really wanna lean on this man
Remember all the beautiful moments
We share
My darling please think twice

[CHORUS]:

Baby I
I swear to god up in the sky
I’ll be your shelter when you cry
Cause you are my everything
Baby I
I traveled around the seven seas
I’d climb any mountain high
And speak to you
Cause you are my everything

Oh I think I am lost in the wind
Without you by my side
There is none who can hold me
Together we would fight any storm
I could show you how
Just give me your hand now
I really wanna make you mine
(To make it feel alright)
Baby for all the time
I never let you feel down
(Want you to be around)
Cause you surrender my heart

[CHORUS]:

Baby I
I swear to god up in the sky
I’ll be your Sheller when you cry
Cause you are my everything
Baby I
I traveled around the seven seas
I’d climb any mountain high
And speak to you
Cause you are my everything

I’ll be there whenever you call
I wash the teardrops from your skin
Cause in my dreams
I’ve made such a plan
For you and me
We built a castle
Where we could settle down my friend
Romantic melodies been played
By the wind

[CHORUS]:

Baby I
I swear to god up in the sky
I’ll be your Sheller when you cry
Cause you are my everything
Baby I
I traveled around the seven seas
I’d climb any mountain high
And speak to you
Cause you are my everything
                        
                    |
