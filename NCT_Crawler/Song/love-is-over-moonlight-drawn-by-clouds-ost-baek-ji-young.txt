Baek ji young – love is over english translation
Between the storm clouds in the gray sky
When the spilling rain falls on my cheek
The tears i held back burst out
It’s over now, now
Love is over
Love is over
Love is over
I hit my heart
Even if my heart is bruised
It’s over
No words can comfort me
My heart is getting ruined
I’m just standing here
When can i let you go?
This foolish waiting
I’m sick of it
Love is over
Love is over
Love is over
I hit my heart
Even if my heart is bruised
It’s over
On this lonely road that gets darker and darker
There is a long shadow, with nowhere to go
Love is over
Love is over
Love is over
I hit my heart
Even if my heart is bruised
It’s over
