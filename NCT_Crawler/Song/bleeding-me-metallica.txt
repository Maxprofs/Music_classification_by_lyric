                        I'm diggin' my way
 Yes, I'm diggin' my way to somethin'

 Yes, I'm pushin' to stay with somethin'
 I'm pushin' to stay with something better I'm sowin' the seeds, yes
 Yes, I'm sowin' the seeds I've taken
 Sowin' the seeds I take for granted This thorn in my side
 Yes, this thorn in my side is from the tree
 This thorn in my side is from the tree I've planted
 It tears me and I bleed and I bleed Caught under, the wheels roll
 I take that leash, yeah, I'm bleeding me
 Can't stop to save my soul
 I take the leash that's leading me I'm bleeding me, I can't take it
 Caught under, wheels roll the bleeding of me
 Yes, of me, the bleeding of me I'm caught under, wheels roll
 I take the leach, hey, I'm bleeding me
 I can't stop to save my soul
 I take that leash that's leading me I'm bleeding me, I can't take it
 Caught under, wheels roll
 The bleeding of me
 The bleeding of me I am the beast that bleeds the feast
 I am the blood, I am release
 Come make me pure, bleed me a cure
 I'm caught, I'm caught, I'm caught under Caught under, wheels roll
 I take that leach, hey, I'm bleeding me
 I can't stop to save my soul
 I take the leash that's leading me I'm bleeding me, I can't take it
 I can't take it, I can't take it
 No, the bleeding of me
 No, feelin' me, come on and bleed me I'm diggin' my way

 With somethin' better
