                        Bài hát : Keep On Loving You - Tokyo Square

I've been waiting for the time
Waiting for you to say you're mine
Can't hide these feelings inside
Let me hold you tonight
I really want you to know
All these feelings I have to show
How much I've been loving you
Tell me you'll be mine

Gonna love you, keep on loving you dear
I will love you till the end of time
I'll be with you no matter what happens
I'll be there by your side
I will hold you, hold you here in my arms
I will promise I wont let you go
Stay with me, make all our dreams come true

I will give you all I have
Cause' you mean the whole world to me
I will love you with my heart
And we'll never part

I've been waiting for the time
Waiting for you to say you're mine
Can't hide these feelings inside
Let me hold you tonight
I really want you to know 
All these feelings I have to show
How much I've been loving you
Tell me you'll be mine

Gonna love you, keep on loving you dear
I will love you till the end of time
I'll be with you no matter what happens
I'll be there by your side
I will hold you, hold you here in my arms
I will promise I wont let you go
Stay with me, make all our dreams come true

I will give you all I have
Cause' you mean the whole world to me
I will love you with my heart
And we'll never part

Gonna love you, keep on loving you dear
I will love you till the end of time
I'll be with you no matter what happens
I'll be there by your side
I will hold you, hold you here in my arms
I will promise I wont let you go
Stay with me, make all our dreams come true

I will give you all I have
Cause' you mean the whole world to me
I will love you with my heart
And we'll never part
                        
                    |
