                        Baby, I'm Sorry

Oh my baby
oh my darling
tell me what i've done
won't you tell me
did i hurt you
where did we go wrong

The first time when i saw you
i fell in love with you girl
the way you smile so sweetly
can't stop just thinking of you

Baby can't you see
that my love is real
where did our love go
baby don't you know
and i can't let it go
'cause i love you so
don't you leave me now
'cause i need you so

Baby i'm sorry 
please don't leave me
what should i do now
baby i'm sorry 
if i hurt you
give me one more chance

The first time when i saw you

and i can't let it go
