                        Give Me Novacaine
Green Day

Take away the sensation inside
Bitter sweet migraine in my head
It's like a throbbing toothache of the mind
I can't take this feeling anymore

Drain the pressure from the swelling
This sensation's overwhelming
Give me a long kiss goodnight
and everything will be alright
Tell me that I won't feel a thing,
so give me Novacaine!

Out of body and out of mind
Kiss the demons out of my dreams
I get the funny feeling, that’s alright
Jimmy said it's better than air
I’ll tell you what,

Drain the pressure from the swelling,
This sensation's overwhelming,
Give me a long kiss goodnight
and everything will be alright
Tell me that I won't feel a thing,
so give me Novacaine!

Oh novacaine!

Drain the pressure from the swelling
This sensation's overwhelming
Give me a long kiss goodnight
and everything will be alright
Tell me Jimmy I won't feel a thing,
so give me Novacaine!
