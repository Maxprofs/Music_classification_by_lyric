                        Bài hát: Did I Mention - Jeff Lewis

Did I mention...
That I’m in love with you.
Did I mention...
There’s nothing I can do.
And did I happen to say?
I dream of you everyday
But let me shout it out, if that’s okay ay ay
That’s okay

I met this girl that rocked my world like it’s never been rocked
And now I’m living just for her and I won’t ever stop
I never thought it can happen to a guy like me.
But now look at what you’ve done, you at got down on my knees.

Because my love for is Ridiculous.
I never knew
(Who knew?)
That it can be like this.
My love for you is Ridiculous
My love is R-I-D-I-C-U-L-O-U-S!
(R-I-D-I-C-U-L-O-U-S!)
It’s...
(RIDICULOUS!)
Just...
(RIDICULOUS!)
And I would give my kingdom for just one kiss.

Well Did I mention...
That I’m in love with you
And did I mention
There’s nothing I can do.
And did I happen to say?
I dream of you everyday
But let me shout it out, if that’s okay ay ay
(yeah!)
If that’s okay.

I gotta know which way to go, c'mon gimme a sign
You gotta show me that you're only ever gonna be mine.
Don’t want to go another minute even without you
That’s if your heart just isn't in it, I don't know what I’d do.

Because my love for is Ridiculous.
I never knew
(Who knew?)
That it can be like this.
My love for you is Ridiculous
My love is R-I-D-I-C-U-L-O-U-S!
(R-I-D-I-C-U-L-O-U-S!)
It’s...
(RIDICULOUS!)
Just...
(RIDICULOUS!)
And I would give my kingdom for just one kiss.
C'mon now!

(Oh yeah!)
(Ya-ow!)
(Alright!)
(Alright!)

Because my love for is Ridiculous.
I never knew
(Who knew?)
That it can be like this.
My love for you is Ridiculous
My love is R-I-D-I-C-U-L-O-U-S!
(R-I-D-I-C-U-L-O-U-S!)
It’s...
(RIDICULOUS!)
Just...
(RIDICULOUS!)
And I would give my kingdom for just one kiss.
C'mon Now!
