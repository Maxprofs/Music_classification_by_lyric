                        Bài Hát: Slumber Party - Britney Spears

[Verse 1]
I think I see confetti from this potion
Pillow fights and feathers, overdosin'
Smells like a cologne and candy lotion
Like a slumber party
Sheets all on the floor just like an ocean
Building up your fortress like a mountain
Neighbors say we're causing a commotion
Like a slumber party

[Pre-Chorus]
No, n-no, no, you and I, I, I
We ain't gonna sleep tonigh-igh-ight
Oh baby, no, n-no, no, you and I, I, I
We ain't gonna sleep tonight
[Chorus]
Cause we got them candles hanging
Hanging from the ceiling low
We use our bodies to make our own videos
Put on our music that makes us go *** crazy, oh
Go crazy, oh
Like a slumber party
Like a slumber party
Like a slumber party

[Verse 2]
Let's fill up this clawfoot bath with bubbles
Loving me so hard it's causing trouble
If the seven minutes in heaven make it double, triple
Like a slumber party

[Pre-Chorus]
No, n-no, no, you and I, I, I
We ain't gonna sleep tonigh-igh-ight
Oh baby, no, n-no, no, you and I, I, I
We ain't gonna sleep tonight

[Chorus]
Cause we got them candles hanging
Hanging from the ceiling low
We use our bodies to make our own videos
Put on our music that makes us go *** crazy, oh
Go crazy, oh
Like a slumber party
We got them candles hanging
Hanging from the ceiling low
We use our bodies to make our own videos
Put on our music that makes us go *** crazy, oh
(Crazy, oh) Go crazy, oh
Like a slumber party
Like a slumber party
A slumber party, yeah

[Refrain]
Like a slumber party
No, n-no, no, you and I, I, I
We ain't gonna sleep tonight
Like a slumber party

[Chorus]
Cause we got them candles hanging
Hanging from the ceiling low
We use our bodies to make our own videos (oh, videos)
Put on our music that makes us go *** crazy, oh
Go crazy, oh
Like a slumber party
We got them candles hanging
Hanging from the ceiling low
We use our bodies to make our own videos
Put on our music that makes us go *** crazy, oh
(Go crazy, yeah) Go crazy, oh
Like a slumber party (a slumber party)
Like a slumber party (I go crazy for you)
Like a slumber party
