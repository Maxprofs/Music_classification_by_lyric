                        Bài hát: Oracion (No Game No Life Ending) - Ai Kayano

[romaji] :
Dare ni mo ienai kodoku o kakaeta mama hitori de naiteta
Dare ni mo jouzu ni waraenai bokura futari deatte waratta

Mayonaka sugi ni souzou no oku ni
Dou shi you mo nai kimochi o tada oshiyatte

Sayonara bokura wa kitto umarekawareru kara
Kanashimi ni te o furundeshou
Soshite itsuka karappo no mama no kokoro ni akari o tomosu you ni
Togiretogire no kotoba o sagashite tsunagitometa
Soredemo tatta futari no sekai wa tsudzuiteikunda
Sora ni inoru you ni douka eien ni

Shiro kuro ichi zero bokura wa erabu koto o semararete bakari
Soushite nokotta daiji na mono o kowareru hodo dakishimeteita

Akegata sugi no hikari no saki ni
Hon no sukoshi dake mirai ga mieta ki ga shite

Bakageta yume datte kitto negai tsudzukeru kara
Kiseki ni chikadzukun deshou
Sore wa kimi no yowasa no tonari ni mitsuketa tsuyosa no kakera datte
Togiretogire no kotoba o sagashite tsunagitometa
Mabuta no oku ni nijinda sekai o mamotteyukunda
Sora ni inoru you ni kimi to chikau ashita

Fujiyuu na omoi ga kasanariattara
Sou sa dare yori jiyuu ni nareta
Tarinai mono o umeau you ni
Utagai mo sezu sasaeai nagara

Sayonara bokura wa kitto umarekawareru kara
Kanashimi ni te o furundeshou
Soshite itsuka karappo no mama no kokoro ni akari o tomosu you ni
Togiretogire no kotoba o sagashite tsunagitometa
Soredemo tatta futari no sekai wa tsudzuiteikunda
Sora ni inoru you ni douka eien ni...

[english translation] :
I was crying alone, clutching a loneliness i couldn’t put into words.
That’s when we, who could never put on a smile for others, met one another and smiled together.

We took the feelings we could do nothing about,
And in the dead of night pushed them into the backs of our imaginations.

Goodbye! The two of us will surely be reborn,
Saying farewell to sadness.
Then, as if lighting a flame in our once empty hearts,
We sought out our disconnected words, weaving them together.
Even so, our own personal world will continue on,
Like a prayer to the sky... That i hope lasts forever.

White/black; one/zero: we’re faced with unending decisions,
Until we’re left with one precious thing, clutching it hard enough to break.

Just after the light of dawn,
We thought we might have seen a glimpse of the future.

We’ll probably never stop wishing for the most foolish things,
But we’ll be that much closer to a miracle.
You’ll find a fragment of strength beside your weakness,
And your disconnected words will be sought out and woven together.
We’ll go on protecting the world behind our eyelids,
Like a prayer to the sky... I made a vow with you.

If we begin to feel constantly restricted,
That’s when we’ll know we’re freer than anyone else.
As if filling in each others’ missing pieces,
We’ll support each other without a shred of doubt.

Goodbye! The two of us will surely be reborn,
Saying farewell to sadness.
Then, as if a flame was lit within our empty hearts,
Disconnected words will be sought out and woven together.
Even then, our own personal world will continue on,
Like a prayer to the sky... That i hope lasts forever...
