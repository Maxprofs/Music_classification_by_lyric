                        Caribbean time in motion
 Fireflyin' across the ocean
 And I can see the future Caribbean, Caribbean, Caribbean
 Caribbean, Caribbean, Caribbean In the modern potboiler
 Anesthetize your mind
 And if you won't be a lawyer
 You're gonna need an alibi And if you crave bein' an outlaw
 Better to make a plan
 For the guns and the promises they feed you
 Will drag you in the sand Nobody come clever enough
 Before they get there, move their mainland rough
 I'm takin' no direction and I walk-a real slow
 For the words of oppression are go, go, go Caribbean time in motion
 Fireflyin' across the ocean
 And I can see the future Barbados to Barcelona
 Caribbean time hereunder
 I can see the future Caribbean, Caribbean, Caribbean
 Caribbean, Caribbean, Caribbean If you want a dictator
 You best get organized
 And if you wan' be a hater
 You make trains run on time And if you crave a good pupil
 Bring glory to the schools
 And mind your Qs and Ps 'cause an island breeze
 Is breakin' all the rules Caribbean time in motion
 Fireflyin' across the ocean
 And I can see the future Antigua to Macedonia
 Darwinian time is over
 I can see the future It's no military time
 It's an island time Nobody come clever enough
 Before they get there, move their mainland rough
 I'm takin' no direction and I walk-a real slow
 For the words of oppression are go, go, go Caribbean time in motion
 Fireflyin' across the ocean
 And I can see the future Barbados to Barcelona
 Caribbean time hereunder
 I can see the future Caribbean, Caribbean
 Caribbean, Caribbean, Caribbean
 Caribbean, Caribbean, Caribbean
 Caribbean, Caribbean, Caribbean
 Caribbean, Caribbean, Caribbean It's no military time
 It's an island time
