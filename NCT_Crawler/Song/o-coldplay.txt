                        Bài hát : O - Coldplay

(fly on)
A flock of birds hovering above
A flock of birds
That's how you think of love

And I always
Look up to the sky
Pray before the dawn
Cause they fly always
Sometimes they arrive
Sometimes they are gone
They fly on

A flock of birds
Hovering along
Into smoke I'm turned and rise following them up

Still I always
Look up to the sky
Pray before the dawn
Cause they fly away
One minute they arrive, next you know they're gone
They fly on
Fly on

So fly on
Ride through
Maybe one day I'll fly next to you

Fly on
Ride through
Maybe one day I'll fly with you
Fly on

O
Don't ever let go
