                        Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, y'all, New York City
 Tryna to see where I'ma go tonight
 The most famous town in the whole fuckin' world
 The other night, nigga's at Lotus I hit P and them I was Dom P'ed up in there
 You know but I found this new spot
 We went to the other night, yo
 Check it out check it out how it went It was just cool like, smooth night wit' my jewels bright
 Goons left goons right, coupe wit' blue lights
 Bad girls in black pearls, gave us cat calls
 Took 'em back to the crib to break they ass off In the loft mixin' hash and 'dro
 Honey spreaded that *** like a wide mouth bass
 Sippin' wine out the glass, Teddy Pendergrass blast
 When the phone ring, the house lights flash Turned down the sound, let's get down to bidness
 *** about to go down wit' some foul niggaz
 What the voice said, "What up pop? Who want it?"
 I put the guap up, get the boy popped He say, "Son stop, it's dudes you feedin'
 Who feedin' other dudes, but they really not eatin'"
 Dog, why you callin' me? This our food
 You, handle the mouths that it trickles down to Niggaz want beef, I want some of that cow too
 But I'm in my princely robe, simply rich
 Don't bother me wit' silly ***, call Rico
 He said, "It is Rico, of all people Gave his moms furs, called up the mayor
 To get his crime pardoned, his son's godfather
 Said the nigga shot up my cars
 Last night he laid for me to come out my doors? Niggaz always on that bull***
 To make a nigga wanna open up a full clip
 Niggaz always on that bull***
 Now ya funeral, the preacher's at the pulpit Niggaz always on that bull***
 To make a nigga wanna open up a full clip
 Niggaz always on that bull***
 Now ya funeral, the preacher's at the pulpit
 You can't kill me High, fly, send a fella loaf or glass?
 Fold up cash, you ain't heard the soldier's half
 You speakin' hogwash, silly ***, broke to dash
 I got the live sparked, Phillies lit, smoker's jacket on The son of a Cap-ricorn, my dad's a don
 What you think that he spawned? A slacker? Nah
 Packed the nines, yo this nigga's asinine
 Smack ya mom, relaxed and calm, then mack ya mom In a casket, you'll get ya fashion on
 You'll be in a suit and tie, you'll die
 You'll make maggots turn to flies, fuckin' wit' Nas
 Remember anyone can get it at anytime Lames'll swear by ya name, when they lie
 Get hit wit' the lone star, ripped where ya bones are
 So tell me how yo' ass gon' run
 From a C Z P O 1? In the midst of real steel movers, you a loser
 Merk you wit'cha own shooters
 All you want is a name, pissed and insane
 My security system, my playspot a fireplace, listen Then it goin' off, start spittin'
 Niggaz try to bring it where I live in
 Trustin' you, knew where all of the cribs at
 So we waited wit' the cigs blat, blat, blat Niggaz always on that bull***
 To make a nigga wanna open up a full clip
 Niggaz always on that bull***
 Now ya funeral, the preacher's at the pulpit Niggaz always on that bull***
 To make a nigga wanna open up a full clip
 Niggaz always on that bull***
 Now ya funeral, the preacher's at the pulpit
 You can't kill me You can't kill me
 You can't kill me
 You can't kill me
