[Intro]
Hey
If you know what's good
(If you know what's good)
If you know what's good
(If you know what's good)
Hey, if you know what's good
(If you know what's good)

[Hook]
Haters gon' say it's fake
So real
Haters gon' say it's fake
So real
Haters gon' say it's fake
So real
All my haters gon' say it's fake
I guess I got my swagger back

[Chorus]
I said, put your filthy hands all over me
And no, this ain't the clean version
And what you gonna do with all that meat?
Cookin' up a mean servin'

[Verse]
No question, I want it
Fire up, everybody smokin'
Your friends, my friends
And they ain't leavin' till six in the morning (six in the morning)
Caught a chill, baby, you the coldest
Go far, put 'em on notice
If you know what I want, then yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Baby, don't you mind if I do, yeah
Exactly what you like times two, yeah
Got me singin', "ooh, ooh"
So baby, don't you mind if I do

[Chorus]
Look, put your filthy hands all over me
And no, this ain't the clean version
And what you gonna do with all that beast?
When I leave the cage open
Huh, walk to me, uh

[Verse]
No question, I want it
Fire up, everybody smokin'
Your friends, my friends
And they ain't leavin' till six in the morning (six in the morning)
Caught a chill, baby, you the coldest
Go far, put 'em on notice
If you know what I want, then yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
Baby, don't you mind if I do, yeah
Exactly what you like times two, yeah
Got me singin', "ooh, ooh"
So baby, don't you mind if I do

[Bridge]
Come on, break it down!
If you know what's good
(If you know what's good)
If you know what's good
(If you know what's good)
If you know what's good
(If you know what's good)

[Hook]
Haters gon' say it's fake
So real
Haters gon' say it's fake
So real
Haters gon' say it's fake
So real
All my haters gon' say it's fake

[Pre-Chorus]
Baby, don't you mind if I do
Exactly what you like times two (times two)
Got me singin', "ooh, ooh"
Baby, don't you mind if I do
(Come on!)
Your friends, my friends
And they ain't leavin' till six in the morning (six in the morning)
Your friends, my friends
And they ain't leavin' till six in the morning (six in the morning)

[Chorus]
So put your filthy hands all over me
And no, this ain't the clean version
Go on and put your filthy hands all over me
No, this ain't the clean version

[Outro]
Do you see me?
Can you find me?
Look closer
Through the trees
Do you see it?
