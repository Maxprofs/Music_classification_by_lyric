                        Bài hát: You Got The Best Of Me - Meghan Trainor

These fire burns are melting me away
All I wanted was your sympathy but You got the best of me 
These fire burns are melting me away
All I wanted was your sympathy but You got the best of me 
So here's what I've been wanting to say 
You got me got me going insane 
I cant accpet the things you do
One, ashame on me And two ashame on you
It's like fire 
How you burn me up 
Now it turns on you 
I've had enough 
These fire burns are melting me away 
All I wanted was your sympathy but You got the best of me 
These fire burns are melting me away
All I wanted was your sympathy but You got the best of me
So I'm here just asking for help 
Oh you wont no, you wont be nothing help 
You would test right from the start 
So you can you can have my heart 
It's like fire 
How you burn me up 
Now it turns on you 
I've had enough ... 
Oh and i know that you dont know Just how i feel inside 
And it hurts to see me cry 
Just switch up to me 
And baby you'll see.
