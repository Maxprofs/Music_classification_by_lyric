                        Everything I do is just to make you proud
 I'm hoping you can hear me so I sing it loud, yeah
 I'm worried about you and you don't need protecting
 But I feel like I'm the weapon in your holster
 If you need, I'll come and get you
 I'm open to be your chauffeur
 No signal, low bat, smiley face, wink wink, baby text back Haagen Dazs, woo! Up all night
 Baby one spoon spare, in case you answer my call
 PJ's on, me-mean face on
 Bidding for your love, get my eBay on
 Breakfast in bed, Ramsay apron
 Like your eggs over easy, streaky ba-con ...
 Toast, you can share a piece of mine
 'Cause as long as you're here, I got peace of mind Tyler James: I worry about you babe
 When your phone's not on
 I come by and you're not home
 Worry about you baby
 I worry about you Worry about you babe
 When it's late at night
 You come back and looking fresh from a fight
 Worry about you baby
 I worry about you I ain't sleeping at night
 And I ain't eating quite right
 I just worry about you Tell me what I'm supposed to say
 Watch you throw your love away
 Worry about you baby
 I worry about you
 Tell me what I'm supposed to do
 Expect me to go down with you
 Worry about you baby
 I worry about you I worry about you babe
 When I'm right you're wrong
 Roller-coasters till dawn
 Worry about you baby
 Worry about you Worry about you babe
 'Cause the world you're in
 I so easily fit in
 I worry about you baby
 I worry about you 'Cause we ain't sleeping at night
 We ain't eating quite right
 I just worry about you Tell me what I'm supposed to say
 Watch you throw your love away
 Worry about you baby
 I worry about you
 Tell me what I'm supposed to do
 Expect me to go down with you
 Worry about you baby
 I worry about you I ain't sleeping at night
 And I ain't eating quite right
 I just worry about you Kano: Yeah, so let me be the friend
 That might piss you off but there's a means to an end
 I could rap about the AMG, yeah the Benz
 But there's some deep seeded issues me and you need to cleanse,
 Look, I'm a worrier, you're a warrior
 Out with the snakes in disguise where's the Tommy guns
 Holding on tight, real love might come at once
 So why throw away something special everybody wants Tyler James: Tell me what I'm supposed to say
 Watch you throw your love away
 Worry about you baby
 I worry about you
 Tell me what I'm supposed to do
 Expect me to go down with you
 I worry about you baby
 I worry about you
