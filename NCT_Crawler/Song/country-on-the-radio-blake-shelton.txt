                        Bài hát: Country On The Radio - Blake Shelton 

You ever wondered why country songs say the same ol' thing,
Like a broken record skippin down on main,
Pretty girls, pickups and cut-off jeans?
You know what I mean

Dirt roads, corn rows and homemade wine
Juke joints, jumpin on the county line
Heard 'em singin 'bout it a million times
But I don't mind

As long as there's a small town and a Saturday night
Blue jean babies in the full moonlight
Tip back your Dixie, howl at the stars
Every time you hear that sly guitar
And your baby's on the tailgate
And you're stealin those kisses to a little George Strait
That's how we're rockin, that's how we roll
As long as there's country on the radio

There's always gonna be a party out in the pines
Always gonna be a shot up highway sign
Paper sack full of beer and a jar of shine
From time to time

There's always gonna be people tryin to run us down
Sayin we ain't got nothin on a big town
I bet they'd come around
If they came on down

As long as there's a small town and a Saturday night
Blue jean babies in the full moonlight
Tip back your Dixie, howl at the stars
Every time you hear that sly guitar
And your baby's on the tailgate
And you're stealin those kisses to a little George Strait
That's how we're rocking, that's how we roll
As long as there's country on the radio

There's always gonna be a part of me
Kickin back in BFE
Yea, that's how it's always gonna be

As long as there's a small town and a Saturday night
Blue jean babies in the full moonlight
Tip back your Dixie, howl at the stars
Every time you hear that sly guitar
And your baby's on the tailgate
And you're stealing those kisses to a little George Strait
That's how we're rocking, that's how we roll
As long as there's country on the radio

Some country on the radio
As long as there's a small town
Saturday nights
Blue jean babies
Yeah, tip back your Dixie
Stealing those kisses
                        
                    |
