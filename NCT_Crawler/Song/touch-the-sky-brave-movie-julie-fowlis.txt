                        Touch the Sky - Julie Fowlis

When cold wind is-a calling, and the sky is clear and bright,
Misty mountains sing and beckon, lead me out into the light.
I will ride; I will fly,
Chase the wind, and touch the sky.
I will fly,
Chase the wind, and touch the sky.

Where dark woods hide secrets,
and mountains are fierce and bold,
Deep waters hold reflections of times lost long a-go.
I will read every story, take hold of my own dream,
Be as strong as the seas are stormy, and proud as an eagles scream.
I will ride; I will fly,
Chase the wind, and touch the sky.
I will fly,
Chase the wind, and touch the sky.
