Yoranhan soril naemyeo kkaejineun yuribyeong uri moseubilkka

Wae ijeya wanyamyeo nal gidaryeodamyeo nae sarang bangyeodeon neoneun ije
Eojjeoda majuchin moreuneun saramboda chagapge eoreoida

Hwanhan ne misodo (hwanhan misodo) ttatteushan ne pumdo (ne eolguldo)

Urin machi yoltu-shi samshibbunui sigyesbaneulcheoreom

English translation

Beast - ‘12시 30분 (12:30)’

The glass bottle that shatters into pieces with a loud noise, is that how we are?
Since the lowly spread out sky seems like it’ll break at any moment
You who had asked why i came now, that you had waited for me, you who had welcomed my love
You’re even colder than people you meet for the first time

Even your bright smile (even your bright smile) even your warms arms (and your face)
I’m in fear as if i’ll no longer be able to see or touch them

And now, it’s as if we’re needles on a clock that reads 12:30
Like we’re trying to throw everything away with our backs to each other
It’s as if we’re needles on a clock that reads 12:30
Walking to a place of no return

Seems like the time that followed us also came to a stop
Seems like we became more like “you, me” instead of “we”
Seems like everything that once passed us by has passed us by again
Seems like your hand that i seem to have lost sight of was my true warmth
I knew that you were being shaken, that’s why i grabbed onto you tigher
I held you in my arms and locked you in, and my love became more poisonus
Yeah i know, that it’s all my fault but
But these feelings left behind can’t let go of hope

Even your bright smile (even your bright smile) even your warms arms (and your face)
I’m in fear as if i’ll no longer be able to see or touch them

And now, it’s as if we’re needles on a clock that reads 12:30
Like we’re trying to throw everything away with our backs to each other
It’s as if we’re needles on a clock that reads 12:30
Walking to a place of no return

One day, when a break-up kneels before me, then
I believe that it will start flowing again like us, i believe that that time will come like that
Even though i now let go of you, even though i let go of you, even though everything has stopped
I believe that the old broken clock will once again move

And now, it’s as if we’re needles on a clock that reads 12:30
Like we’re trying to throw everything away with our backs to each other
It’s as if we’re needles on a clock that reads 12:30
Walking to a place of no returna
                        
                    |
