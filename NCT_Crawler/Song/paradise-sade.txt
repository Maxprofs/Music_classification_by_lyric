                        I'd wash the sand off the shore
 Give you the world if it was mine
 Blow you right to my door
 Feels fine Feels like
 You're mine
 Feels right
 So fine
 I'm yours, you're mine
 Like paradise I'd give you the world if it was mine
 Feels fine Feels like you're mine
 And I'm yours so fine
 Like paradise I'd wash the sand off the shore
 Give you the world if it was mine
 Blow you right to my door
 Feels fine Feels like
 You're mine
 Feels right
 So fine
 I'm yours, you're mine
 Like paradise Ooh what a life
 Ooh what a life
 Ooh what a life
 Ooh what a life I wanna share my life
 Wanna share my life with you
 Wanna share my life I wanna share my life
 Wanna share my life with you
 Wanna share my life Wanna share my life
 I wanna share my love with you
 Wanna share my life
 (Ooh what a life) Wanna share my life with you
 Wanna share my life
 (Like paradise)
 Wanna share my life with you
 Wanna share my life
 Wanna share my life with you
