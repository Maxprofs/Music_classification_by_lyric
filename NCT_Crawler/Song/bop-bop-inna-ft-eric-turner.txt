                        Bài hát: Bop Bop - Inna, Eric Turner

Bop bop, close the shop 
A big night on the rocks 
Bop bop, bop, b-bop 

Bop bop, bop, b-bop
Bop bop, close the shop
A big night on the rocks
Bop bop, bop, b-bop
Bop bop, bop, b-bop

Woke up, Mexico
Can't lie, here we go
Drink fizz, in my glass
Shake shake shaky-shake my shack
We meet all the cops
Music, fade out black
Bop bop, bop, b-bop
Bop bop, bop, b-bop

Milkshake on the rock
They're dancing in the streets
Hands up, holla back and come on dance with me
High hands on your hips, and work it, baby please
One kiss on the lips, it's summer by the sea
Mister frisky

Bop bop, close the shop
A big night on the rocks
Bop bop, bop, b-bop
Bop bop, bop, b-bop
Bop bop, close the shop
A big night on the rocks
Bop bop, bop, b-bop
Bop bop, bop, b-bop

Wake up it's time to blend
Everything 'til the juice is in
Mix it up it's bubblin'
Now you're tripping on the good ***
Get your workin' like an animal
Always ready, baby lock the door
Bop bop, bop, b-bop
Bop bop, bop, b-bop

Milkshake on the rock
They're dancing in the streets
Hands up, holla back and come on dance with me
High hands on your hips, and work it, baby please
One kiss on the lips, it's summer by the sea
Mister frisky

Bop bop, close the shop
A big night on the rocks
Bop bop, bop, b-bop
Bop bop, bop, b-bop
Bop bop, close the shop
A big night on the rocks
Bop bop, bop, b-bop
Bop bop, bop, b-bop

Hands against the wall
Mr. Officer, I don't know nothing, that is the truth
(So how you gonna move?
That is the truth
So how you gonna move?
That is the truth)

Bop bop, close the shop
A big night on the rocks
Bop bop, bop, b-bop
Bop bop, bop, b-bop

Bop bop, close the shop
A big night on the rocks
Bop bop, bop, b-bop
Bop bop, bop, b-bop
