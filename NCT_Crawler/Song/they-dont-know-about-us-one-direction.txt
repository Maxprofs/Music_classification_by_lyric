                        Bài hát: They Don't Know About Us - One Direction

[Liam]
People say we shouldn’t be together
We're too young to know about forever
But I say they don’t know what they talk talk talkin’ about

[Harry]
Cause this love is only getting stronger
So I don’t wanna wait any longer
I just wanna tell the world that you're mine girlll
Ohh

[All - Zayn]
They don’t know about the things we do
They don’t know about the I love you’s
But I bet you if they only knew
They will just be jealous of us
They don’t know about the up all night’s
They don’t know I've waited all my life
Just to find a love that feels this right

Baby they don’t know about
They don’t know about us

[Niall]
Just one touch and I was a believer
Every day it gets a little sweeter

[Harry]
It� � getting better
Keeps getting better all the time girl

[All]
They don’t know about the things we do
They don’t know about the I love you’s
But I bet you if they only knew
They will just be jealous of us
They don’t know about the up all night’s
They don’t know I've waited all my life
Just to find a love that feels this right

Baby they don’t know about
They don’t know about us

[Louis]
They don’t know how special you are
They don’t know what you’ve done to my heart
They can say anything they want
Cause they don’t know about us

[Niall]
They don’t know what we do best
That’s between me and you our little secret

[Zayn]
But I wanna tell em
I wanna tell the world that you're mine girl

[All]
They don’t know about the things we do
They don’t know about the I love you’s
But I bet you if they only knew
They will just be jealous of us
They don’t know about the up all night’s
They don’t know I've waited all my life
Just to find a love that feels this right

Baby they don’t know about
They don’t know about the things we do
They don’t know about the I love you’s
But I bet you if they only knew
They will just be jealous of us
They don’t know about the up all night’s
They don’t know I've waited all my life
Just to find a love that feels this right

Baby they don’t know about
They don’t know about us

[Zayn]
They don’t know about us
They don’t know about us
