                        Bài hát: Leemon tree - M2M



Verse 1
I lie awake at night
See things in black and white
I only got you inside my mind 
You know you have made me blind

Verse 2
I lie awake and pray 
That you will look my way
I have all this longing in my heart
I knew it right from the start

CHORUS
Oh my pretty pretty boy
I love you
Like I never ever loved no one before you
Pretty pretty boy you're mine
Just tell me you love me too 
Oh my pretty pretty boy 
I need you
Oh my pretty pretty boy I do 
Let me inside 
Make me stay 
Right beside you

Verse 3
I used to write your name
I'll put it in a frame
And sometimes I think I hear you call
Right from my bedroom wall

Verse 4 
You stay a little while
And touch me with your smile
And what can I say to make you mine
To reach out for you in time 

CHORUS
Oh my pretty pretty boy
I love you
Like I never ever loved no one before you
Pretty pretty boy you're mine
Just tell me you love me too 
Oh my pretty pretty boy 
I need you
Oh my pretty pretty boy I do 
Let me inside 
Make me stay 
Right beside you

BRIDGE
Oh pretty boy
pretty boy
pretty boy~~
Say you love me too

CHORUS
Oh my pretty pretty boy
I love you
Like I never ever loved no one before you
Pretty pretty boy you're mine
Just tell me you love me too 
Oh my pretty pretty boy 
I need you
                        
                    |
