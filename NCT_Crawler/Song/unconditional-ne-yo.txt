Title: Unconditional
Artist: Ne-Yo

And I would do anything for you

Not in words, no I really mean it

Let the whole damn world declare war on me

Just for standing by your side

It’s truly, you was the one way I survive

I’ll gladly die a million

I would do anything for you

Unconditioned, unconditional love

And I would do anything for you

I’m talking Unconditioned, unconditional 

love

And I would do anything for you

(for you, for you, for you)

Not words, let my actions speaking

(anything for you, for you)

Let the sun decide that it won’t shine until, I say that we are through

I would live my life in darkness just for you

I swear it’s true, I mean it

I would do anything for you

Unconditioned-unconditional 

love

I would do anything for you

I’m talking Unconditioned-unconditional 

Unconditional 

Love

I’m talking Unconditioned, Unconditioned

I’m talking Unconditioned, Unconditioned
I don’t care about what’s popular

I don’t hear a word they say

What I know is that it’s you and me until both of our dying day

Uuuh, oh, oh, oh
Hey, hey

I would do anything for you

Unconditioned-unconditional love

oh uuah

I would do anything for you baby

Unconditioned-unconditional love

oh oh

Unconditioned-Unconditional

Unconditional, 

Unconditional

Unconditional

Unconditional

Love
