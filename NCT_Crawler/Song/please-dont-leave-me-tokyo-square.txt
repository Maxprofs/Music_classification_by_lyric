                        Bài hát: Please Don't Leave Me - Tokyo Square

You are the one who could know me at all
I just can't stop loving you ,dear
The end if it all i wanna do
Don't you know just how i feel
Don't you ever leave me alone
All the thing you do
Telling me to give up all your love
You said this could be or goodbye
So please don't ask for love no more
Let you through that door
Can't you see in my eyes
Please don't say goodbye
I know i can't live my life alone without you near me
I just can't live without your love
I need you here with me
If i could change your mind , anything at all
Oh please our love,please don't leave me
I just can't live without your love
I need you here with me
If i could change your mind , anything at all
I know i will never love again
Cause you're in my heart
All the thing you do
Telling me to give up all your love
You said this could be or goodbye
So please don't ask for love no more
Let you through that door
Can't you see in my eyes
Please don't say goodbye
I know i can't live my life alone without you near me
Welcome to ***
I just can't live without your love
I need you here with me
If i could change your mind , anything at all
Oh please our love,please don't leave me
I just can't live without your love
I need you here with me
If i could change your mind , anything at all
I know i will never love again
Cause you're in my heart
