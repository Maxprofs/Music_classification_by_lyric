                        Song: Power - Katy Perry

I was fine before I met you
Truth is that I lost myself inside you
It is not fair to put all that on you
But you took control
Of a vulnerable soul

Yeah, I am my mother's daughter
And there are so many things I love about her
But I have, I have to break the cycle
So I can sit first at the dinner table

You can't clip my wings, can't wield my powers
Stole my time, but I make up the hours
'Cause I'm a goddess and you know it
Some respect, you better show it
I'm done with you siphoning my power
Power

Hell hath no fury like a woman
Reborn, and now I'm burning like a blue flame
Once more, but don't mistake my warn for weakness
Don't bite the hand that feeds, oh, yeah
I'll never eat, no-oh

You can't clip my wings, can't wield my powers
Stole my time but I make up the hours
'Cause I'm a goddess and you know it
Some respect, you better show it
I'm done with you siphoning my power
Power

And now I'm taking it back
Electric as *** (come on)
You can't quiet this thunder, no
Yeah, I'm taking it back
Lit all the way up
Even in the dark, I glow

You can't clip my wings, can't wilt my flowers
Stole my time but I make up the hours
'Cause I'm a goddess and you know it
Some respect, you better show it
I'm done with you siphoning my power
Power
