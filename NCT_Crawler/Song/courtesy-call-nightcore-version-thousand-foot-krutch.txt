                        Bài hát: Courtesy Call (Nightcore Version) - Thousand Foot Krutch

[Chorus]
Hey-o here comes the danger up in this club
When we get started and we ain't gonna stop
We gonna turn it out till it gets too hot
Everybody sing, Hey-O
Tell'em turn it up till they can't no more
Lets get this thing shakin like a disco ball
This is your last warning, a courtesy call

Hey-O, here comes the danger up in this club
When we get started and we ain't gonna stop
We gonna turn it out till it gets too hot
Everybody sing, Hey-O
Tell'em turn it up till they can't no more
Lets get this thing shakin like a disco ball
This is your last warning, a courtesy call

[Verse 1]
I am not afraid of the storm that comes my way
When it hits it shakes me to the core 
and makes me stronger than before
It's not a question about trust 
but will you stand with us
Can you feel it, make it real

[Pre-Chorus]
I think it might wash away tonight
Awaken from this never ending fight
It takes more than meets the eye
This war we're fighting is not just rotting

[Chorus]
Hey-o, here comes the danger up in this club
When we get started and we ain't gonna stop
We gonna turn it out till it gets too hot
Everybody sing, Hey-O
Tell'em turn it up till they can't no more
Lets get this thing shakin like a disco ball
This is your last warning, a courtesy call

[Verse 2]
There's a rumble in the floor
So get prepared for war
When it hits it'll knock you to the ground
When it shakes up everything around
but survival is a must
So will you stand with us
Can you feel it, make it real
Make me feel it

[Pre-Chorus]
I think it might wash away tonight
Awaken from this never ending fight
It takes more than meets the eye
This war we're fighting is not just rotting
make it real
make me feel it

[Chorus]
Hey-o here comes the danger up in this club
When we get started and we ain't gonna stop
We gonna turn it out till it gets too hot
Everybody sing, Hey-O
Tell'em turn it up till they can't no more
Lets get this thing shakin like a disco ball
This your last warning, a courtesy call

Hey-o here comes the danger up in this club
When we get started and we ain't gonna stop
We're gonna turn it up till it gets too hot
Everybody sing, Hey-O
Tell'em turn it out till they can't no more
Lets get this thing shakin like a disco ball
This your last warning, a courtesy call
