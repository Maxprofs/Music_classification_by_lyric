                        I read you
 And God, I'm good at it
 I'm so spot on

 Chord shapes in air
 Embrace the dissonance
 If you dare

 And you, Breathing in
 Finesse an innocent
 From her partying

 And I'm high enough from all the waiting
 To ride a wave on your inhaling
 And I'm high enough from all the waiting
 To ride a wave on your inhaling
 'Cause I love you, oh
 Can't help but love you, oh

 What part of "no"
 Don't you understand?
 I've told you before

 To just get
 Off my case
 This isn't happening
 Stop this now

 And I
 Where was I?
 I have to be somewhere
 Now where did I put it?

 And I'm high enough from all the waiting
 To ride a wave on your inhaling
 And I'm high enough from all the waiting
 To ride a wave on your inhaling
 'Cause I love you, oh
 Can't help but love you, oh

 Is this it?
 Is this it?
 Is this it?
 Yeah
 Is this it?
 No
 Is this it?
 Oh
 Is this it?
 No
 Is this it?
 No
 Is this it?

 Yes

 Hello, we're back
 And we're taking calls
 Now what was the question?

 And I'm high enough from all the waiting
 To ride a wave on your inhaling
 And I'm high enough from all the waiting
 To ride a wave on your inhaling
 And I'm high enough from all the waiting
 To ride a wave on your inhaling

 Because I love you, oh
 Can't help but love you, oh
 Because I love you, oh
 Can't help but love you, oh
 Because I love you, oh
 Can't help but love you, oh
