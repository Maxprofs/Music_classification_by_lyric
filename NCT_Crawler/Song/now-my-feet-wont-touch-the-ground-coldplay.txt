[00:-2.00]Coldplay - Now My Feet Won't Touch The Ground
[00:-1.00]

Let me go
Boys, let me go
Push my boat from the highest cliff
To the sea below

Rocks awaiting
Boys, rocks awaiting
Swoop down from the sky and catch me
Like a bird of prey

Now my feet won't touch the ground
Now my head won't stop
You wait a lifetime
To be found
Now my feet won't touch the ground

Now my feet won't touch the ground
Now my head won't stop
You wait a lifetime
To be found
Now my feet won't touch the ground
Now my feet won't touch the ground
