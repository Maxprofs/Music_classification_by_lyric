                        Loneliness of 1000 Years - Revolution Renaissance

On our paths
We have lost
We have lived
We have hurt

Still we're here
Facing new day
With a smile,
Through a tear

Never lost
Our hope
Carry on,
When it seemed in vain

All our lives
Looking for
Something that we already have

Through the storms of time
Through the darkness of life
Shines a light, bringing hope
To the lonely souls

We held on to our love
Never gave it up
Dream away the loneliness...
...of a thousand years
                        
                    |
