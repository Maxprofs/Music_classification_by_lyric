                        Bài hát : Don't Let Me Down - Modern Talking

Oh, please believe baby
Ho, it's just a sad, sad memory
Oh, please believe baby
I swear that I am not blind to see

You broke my heart and I mean what I say
I tell you, I swear you, I love you
Don't tear apart, baby please stay
I tell you, I swear you, baby I love you, it's true

Oh baby, don't let me down
Baby, don't fool around
Baby don't stop, my love is hot
Take me, oh, take me tonight

Baby, don't let me down
Baby, don't fool around
Baby don't stop, my love is hot
Take me, oh, take me tonight

Oh, please believe baby
We're closer to heaven, it's true
Oh, please believe baby
There's no me without you

I'm calling your name, I mean what I say
I tell you, I swear you, I love you
My love is a flame, show me the way
I tell you, I swear you, baby I love you, it's true

Ho baby, don't let me down
Baby, don't fool around
Baby don't stop, my love is hot
Take me, oh, take me tonight

Baby, don't let me down
Baby, don't fool around
Baby don't stop, my love is hot
Take me, oh, take me tonight

Don't play a game with me
There is something you'll see
Don't be so strange, baby please stay
Don't be so scared of my love

Baby, don't let me down
Baby, don't fool around
Baby don't stop, my love is hot
Take me, oh, take me tonight

Baby, don't let me down
Baby, don't fool around
Baby don't stop, my love is hot
Take me, oh, take me
Baby, please take me
Take me, oh, take me tonight
