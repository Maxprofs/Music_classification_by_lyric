[Verse 1]
Hey, what's the situation? Ooh oh
I'm just tryin' to make a little conversation
Why the hesitation? Ooh oh
Tell me what your name is, for your information
Don't get me wrong, you know your it's right
Don't be so cold, we could be fire
Tomorrow we'll go, let's start tonight
You know what it's all about

[Hook x2]
I could take you out
I could take you home
I could take you oh, where you wanna go
I could pick it up
We could take it slow
I could take you oh, oh oh oh

[Verse 2]
From my avid reputation, ooh oh
But there's only me and you in this equation
I promise this occasion, ooh oh
Is a different situation, for your information
Don't get me wrong, you know it's right
Don't be so cold, we could be fire
Tomorrow we'll go, let's start tonight
You know what it's all about

[Hook x2]

I could take you out
I could take you home
I could take you out
I could take you home

[Bridge]
Hey senorita, my shorty please be my little lady
My little lady
Mi amore, you're the one I adore, come on be my little lady
My little lady
Baby senorita, my shorty please be my little lady
My little lady
Mi amore, you're the one I adore, come on be my little lady
My little lady

[Hook x2]
