                        Bài hát: Spectre (Live) - Alan Walker

Hello hello
Can you hear me, as I scream your name
Hello hello
Can you see me, near and far away

Is this a place that I call home
To find what I've become
Walk along the path unknown
We live we love we lie

Hello hello
Sound of silence, echo in myself
Hello hello
Lost reliance, a war that never ends

Is this a place that I call home
To find what I've become
Walk along the path unknown
We live we love we lie

Deep in the dark you will see the lie
Like a ghost inside me
It's not that far to the other side
We live we love we lie
                        
                    |
