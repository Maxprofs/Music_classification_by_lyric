uh, Camo shorts and bubba Kush,
we can talk she’d rather fuss,
this and that bout such and such,
damn where is the f-cking trust,
im tired of the hoop and holler’n,
Im bout to take the coupe to collins,
uh, then take a female to the Island,
uh then take her clothes off and do the honours,
yeah now she hearing with them other b-tches,
yeah, I told her mind her f-cking business,

sh-t she prol out here f-cking n-ggas,
im f-cking her friends now her friends aint even f-cking with her,
damn she text me all day and night,
so * off she aint even spelling sh-t right,
i text her back, tell her its life,
now somebody tell them hoes, I’m single for the night,

[Chorus]
yeah Im single,

and my homeboy say he got a bad b-tch for me,
and I’m single,

and Im single,
tonite Im single
and i aint trippin on nothin,
im sipping on somethin,
and my homeboy say he got a bad b-tch for me,

[Verse 2]
Dreads braided to the back,
im chilling but my swag on full attack,
and my girl acting like a brat,
so when she call, i don’t answer I just write her back,
she hate it when I do that sh-t,
and I when get home she go through my sh-t,
she call numbers back to see who that is,
man I hate it when she do that sh-t,

polo t-shirt, polo draws,
now make me take this polo off,
girl you can get broken off,
yeah I f-ck you for an hour than I smoke it off,
swimming trunks and bathing suits,
they go in the bedroom and tell the naked truth,
dont wanna fuss, aint tryna fight,
man somebody tell em hoes I’m single for the night,

[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
Uhh, now she got on her f-ck em dress,
and I got on my double breast,
uh, and he been fussing all day with her,
and I make her feel special like a place kicker,
she wanna be weezy f baby sitter,
say she wish she could cut my d-ck off and take it with her,
I say hold on,
she say she just playing,
then I falls in that p-ssy like quick sand,
uh, hot sex and cold wine,
she left that n-gga hanging like a clothes line,
i cut my phones off, both lines,
its bout to get nasty, pork rinds,
she came hard both times,
we both say we single,
and we both lying,
we both wrong but it feel right,
put your hands up if you single for the night,
put your hands up if you single,
