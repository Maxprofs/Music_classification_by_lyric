                        Bài hát: We Are - WANNA ONE

Yuh urin dallyeo shigani akkaweo
Gomin ttawin eopseo Keep going on
Neowa naega soneul maju jabeul ttae
Kkeojiji ana i bulppicheun
Look at me now ttarawa bwa
We run for the throne and we got this
I don’t wanna play the game
Ijeneun gaya hae Oh ah

Seororeul mideul ttae hanaga dwae
Nae binsone geomeojwin gihwe
Get out of my way jichil ttaen
Neohi deungeul bomyeo ttaragalkke
Uri mamsoge kkumeul dashi kkaeweo
Buranam ttawineun tteolchyeo beoryeo
Gidaehae uril wihan hamseongi
Nareul ireukyeo ssodanae eneoji

Byeorang kkeute naemollineun
Sunganedo beotyeo We’ll be going up
Deo meon goseul barabwa Get your hands on
Doragal goseun deo isang eopseo
Urin amman bogo ga

We are we are we are
We are we are
We are are
Uriga gaya hal girinikka
We are we are we are
We are we are
We are are
That’s the way we are we are

Geommeokji malgo maeum dandani meogeo
Jashingam ppaemyeon shicheya Yah yah namjadapge
Look at me now ttarawa bwa
We run for the throne and we got this
We don’t need to play the game
Huhweneun eopseo Let’s get it on

Neukkim itge Go on kkakkeumhage Throw it up
Miryeon ttawin Stay off you na mean
Sungane ashwium shingyeong sseuji ma
Meori apa eojireoweo
Geurae uri uri urin
Jeulgineun bangbeobeul aljana urin
Geurae neohi neohi neohin
Eonjena jikyeobwa jul geoya uril

Byeorang kkeute naemollineun
Sunganedo beotyeo We’ll be going up
Deo meon goseul barabwa Get your hands on
Doragal goseun deo isang eopseo
Urin amman bogo ga

We are we are we are
We are we are
We are are
Uriga gaya hal girinikka
We are we are we are
We are we are
We are are
That’s the way we are we are

Cheoncheonhi sumeul deurigyeo shimjang soril deureobwa
Jogeupaehaji ma
Don’t give up don’t give up
Don’t lean on don’t lean on me
Noryeokae noryeokae
Urin seuseuro Make it make it
Bigyohaji ma

We are we are we are
We are we are
We are are
Uriga gaya hal girinikka
We are we are we are
We are we are
We are are
That’s the way we are we are
Drop that

We are we are
That’s the way we are
That’s the way we are
Urideulmane bangshik
That’s the way we are we are
We are we are
                        
                    |
