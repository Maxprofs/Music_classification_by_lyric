                        [Intro:]
 Ayo Earv...
 *** is wrong with these niggas man?
 Talkin' 'bout I ain't a ***in' mc...
 I've been at this *** for seven years nigga...
 Eight times platinum nigga...
 Two Bentleys...
 One Lambo, and three houses later mother***er, wassup!

 [Verse:]
 Nah, this ain't no ***in' Dre beat, I got this from Earv Gotti
 Game back on his ***, I'm enemies with urr'body
 Game cook crack, transform to Yayo
 The new Suge Knight nigga, minus the K, yo!
 I keep a candle like Mariah, I'm so fire
 When I step in the club - get low! - like Flo Rider
 'Cause I'm a Pimp
 You can tell by the limp
 When I s-s-s-step aside the twenty-six inch
 You see my rims, they bigger than Bow Wow
 Get money, *** bitches, that's what I'm about now
 The Phantom - ugly, The Bentley - retarded
 The kicks still Chuck Taylor, the jacket is a Starter
 I? Nigga we can get it started
 If you ain't Nas or the nigga on the Third Carter
 My happy face is Kenneth Supreme mugshot
 When it's goin' down, who gon' stop the Blood clock

 [Chorus:]
 Throw yo' hands up it's that gangsta ***
 All the homies goin' crazy when they bump my ***
 Go ahead and hate on my click
 Got a couple words for you niggas, ***
 You strapped - That's right
 Gangbangin' - Fo' life
 Little drama - That's life
 Hit 'em up! - Nice!
 It's that gangsta ***
 All the homies goin' crazy when they bump my ***

 [Verse 2:]
 Nigga I'm'a throw back, you already know that
 Got swag and I'm street, picture the nigga hold strap
 And it's the rock, right in my ***in' sock
 Die from my chain why? So I can go *** with Pac
 Before I go, I shoot it out with the cops
 Hit one for Sean Bell, then bleed on the block
 Like Big did, I play with toys like a big kid
 Got a snuffed nose, call it big tig
 You are not ***in' with Game, he crazy
 And he's boys comin' straight outta' Compton, baby
 My sixteens, it's me, you know what I mean
 Headin' to the airport, my flow flyin' in from Queens
 And? By my bitch, flyin' in with the things
 My shorty is a ten, ?
 The life of a gangsta in Cali is too short
 So I might as well find me a burb in New York

 [Chorus:]
 Throw yo' hands up it's that gangsta ***
 All the homies goin' crazy when they bump my ***
 Go ahead and hate on my click
 Got a couple words for you niggas, ***
 You strapped - That's right
 Gangbangin' - Fo' life
 Little drama - That's life
 Hit 'em up! - Nice!
 It's that gangsta ***
 All the homies goin' crazy when they bump my ***

 [Verse 3:]
 Man you know, I don't give a ***, and I don't give a ***
 Any drama I'm locked on, like a red nose pig
 Keep shootin' them cat guns, with the red nose tips
 Ask some Cali niggas come out and dead those strips
 Don't give *** if you though nigga, or you buff nigga
 My for-five weigh three pounds and it will snuff niggas
 Hop out the truck, with the guns so long
 That the bullets jump out, and that's what's goin' on
 What the *** can I say, I grew up with?
 Got sick of the Impala, so I threw up for Aston
 I pop big ***, and I keep my wrist slick
 My? Shine like the Diamond District
 I got a Rolex, a real big Rolex
 With so many rocks, the Africans are tryin' protest
 ? Of the block, why?
 'Cause they got me top five
 It's fo' niggas better than me, nigga stop lyin'

 [Chorus:]
 Throw yo' hands up it's that gangsta ***
 All the homies goin' crazy when they bump my ***
 Go ahead and hate on my click
 Got a couple words for you niggas, ***
 You strapped - That's right
 Gangbangin' - Fo' life
 Little drama - That's life
 Hit 'em up! - Nice!
 It's that gangsta ***
 All the homies goin' crazy when they bump my ***

 [Outro:]
 News...
 Niggas better know what the *** they dealin' with
 When they dealin' with what they ***in' dealin' with...
 You dealin' with a ***in' animal man...
 Gotti'll tell you nigga...
 Both the guys nigga...
 You can bring John Gotti back too nigga...
 He'll tell you nigga...
 I'm gangsta nigga...
 I was murdered? Before anything man...
 Black Wall Street, Murder Inc man...
 Before I was a Dr. Dre I was a Earv Gotti nigga...
 When I was runnin' around with P. Diddy in Atlanta...
 Slappin' asses nigga...
 Mario Winans know what it is nigga...
 Mix bitches all up in the? On P Street nigga...
 Been gettin' money nigga...
 Seven years strong nigga...
 Two platinum albums nigga...
 'Bout to be three...
 Ey nigga...
 That's a mother***in' hip-hop mйnage б trois, bitch!
