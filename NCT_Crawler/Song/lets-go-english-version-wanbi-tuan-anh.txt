                        Bài Hát: Let’s Go (English Version) - Wanbi Tuấn Anh

Walking holding hands those days have faded away 
I’m facing my life that you’re no longer with me
(I’m so sorry) Time for me to walk away leave it all behind
Don’t keep it deep inside your heart when you’re still not around

So just let it go. I’ll be alright
Finding my own way of life
Oh, this is goodbye. 
We turn the page and let this love end just fine
Ah, it’s so over. And I’m better off your side
I need to leave so baby goodbye

Chorus:
(Baby let go) The love you never show oh oh
(Baby let go) The feeling never grow oh oh 
(Baby let go) Everything left in your soul
Let go. Let go. Let go...

(Baby let go) Then give up the time on us
(Baby let go) I don’t wanna be so hurt 
(Baby let go) Memories will stay in my soul
Let go. Let go. Let go...

Rap: 
So I let go and I don’t wanna know
All the thing deep inside your soul
And when I’m so cold, I face to the window
Miss you so much but I understood this time is better for us
That’s good for both, and I hope you’ll think so
That’s enough for both, and i let go right now
Do you love another guy? I’m sorry I don’t care
It’s not a matter anymore
                        
                    |
