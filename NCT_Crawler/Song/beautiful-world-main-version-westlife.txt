                        Bài hát: Beautiful World (Main Version) - Westlife

Here we go, lost in the lessons
Sometimes I mess up my intentions
I get lost, the cost was losing everything I’ve known
Laying here, staring at the ceiling
Sometimes still dealing with the feelings
Where I’ve been, what I’ve done
I’m so far out there on my own
So quick to point the finger
To find the one to blame
So hard to realize, I kept getting in my own way

I never thought that I was that strong
To carry on, carry on tonight
Forgiveness in your eyes, with nothing to hide
All I know, is you’ve shown me
It’s a beautiful world
It’s a beautiful world

No more fearing my reflection
Here I am, with these imperfections
You know my flaws,
But you don’t care, you take them all
Till now I was barely breathing
But you gave me something to believe in
We’re writing history
Life’s made up of small victories
We could go round in circles
And never get to here
So good to realize that we have nothing left to fear

I never thought that I was that strong
To carry on, carry on tonight
Forgiveness in your eyes, with nothing to hide
All I know, is you’ve shown me
It’s a beautiful world
It’s a beautiful world

So quick to point the finger
When it was me to blame
So hard to realize, I kept getting in my own way

I never thought that I was that strong
To carry on, carry on tonight
Forgiveness in your eyes, there’s nothing to hide
All I know, is you’ve shown me
It’s a beautiful world

Oh the stars alight
Let’s watch them shine for you and I
Oh these open skies
Can we just lie here a while
In this beautiful world

I never thought that I was that strong
To carry on
It’s a beautiful world
It’s a beautiful world
                        
                    |
