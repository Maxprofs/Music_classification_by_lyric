                        From the shadows of the stars
 Comes a man with no face, soul of million scars
 An evil count, the end of days
 He knows our ways and Takes full advantage when we cannot see
 Makes us live in an altered reality To get a hold of the only seed
 We must make them all see bloodshed
 That is he, splitting hairs is not the key
 Water to fire Takes full advantage when we cannot see
 Makes us live in an altered reality One flash of light and for good we are gone
 No one to wonder what we have done
 New breed of ignorance, new circle will start
 Unless we try real hard When you wake up, was it a dream
 All the sick paradigms all around the world
 In the mean time, count, he leaves
 His job is done Take full advantage when we cannot see
 Make us live in an altered reality
 And he takes full advantage when we cannot see
 Makes us live in a full time insanity
                        
                    |
