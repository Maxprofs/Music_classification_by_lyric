 [t]
 My defences
 [t+m]
 Become fences
 [t]
 I'm stumbling
 [t+m]
 I change my face
 And you think I'm fake-up
 Wait around till I take off my makeup
 Here we go again
 I need another one
 Her name is
 She looks through me
 Says I'm the only one

 [m]
 I met a christian in christiansands, a devil in helsinki (x2)

 [t]
 Is it getting better?
 [t+m]
 Wrote her a letter, asking questions
 Baby steps in sections...
 I mean we'll take it slow
 I really don't know
 When you talk, you make me cringe
 Silver me to the messenger
 Let her go don't question her

 [m]
 I met a christian in christiansands, a devil in helsinki (x2)

 [t]
 You and me, what does that mean?
 Always, what does that mean?
 Forever, what does that mean?
 It means we'll manage
 I'll master your language and in the meantime i'll create my own
 By my own

 (repeat from "it means we'll manage" to "by my own" until fade)
