                        There's a light in my life
And its taking me over .
All of my life I've waited for this
Like a flume in the night
You comfort and guide me out of my darkest hours .

coz u light me up when you're around and you give me hope and strength that carries on and now I know what love means

The invisible threads that circle around me
They start at my heart and crawl right out of my skin
When I am all in the dark I still feel you beside me
But I will never let you go

Coz u light me up when you're around and you give me hope and a strength that carries on and now I know what love means

I trust in you, I trust in you, I trust in you, I trust in you

Coz u light me up when you're around and you give me hope and a strength that carries on
and now I know what love means
and now I know what love means
and now I know what love means

There's a light in my life
And its taking me over.
