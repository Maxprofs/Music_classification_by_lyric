                        Bài hát: Chuột Yêu Gạo - Khởi My, Kelvin Khánh

When that day I hear your voice
I have some special feeling
Let me always think I don't wanna forget you
I remember at the day
You are always on my mind
Eventhough I just can think about you
If the day in the future
This love will becoming true
I've never change my mind that I
will love you forever
I don't care how fool it is
I will let my dream come true
I will tell you something I wanna let you know
I let you know
I love you, loving you
As the mouse love the rice
Even every day has storm, I will
always by your side
I miss you, missing you
I don't care how hard it is
I just want you be happy
Everything, I do it for you
                        
                    |
