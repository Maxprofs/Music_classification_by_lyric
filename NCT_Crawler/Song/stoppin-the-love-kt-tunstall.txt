                        Song: Stoppin' The Love - KT Tunstall

So you think it's funny 
That you keep calling me 
all of the time 
Everyday 
Oh honey 
Don't want to be following and falling behind 
If you're gonna be walking away 
And I don't know 
Why I wouldn't follow 
Wouldn't follow 

You got me looking up 
Even when I'm falling down 
You got me crawling out of my skin 
You got me wondering why 
I am underneath this big old sky 
Stopping the loving getting in 

Stopping the loving getting in 

Now you say it's easy 
That you been falling for all of my charm 
And getting lost in my smile 
Never ceases to amaze me 
When I'm chancing my arm 
That I still do it with style 
And now I hope 
You'll be with me tomorrow 
With me tomorrow 

You got me looking up 
Even when I'm falling down 
You got me crawling out of my skin 
You got me wondering why 
I am underneath this big old sky 
Stopping the loving getting in 

Stopping the loving getting in 

You got me looking up 
Even when I'm falling down 
You got me crawling out of my skin 
You got me wondering why 
I am underneath this big old sky 
Stopping the loving getting in
                        
                    |
