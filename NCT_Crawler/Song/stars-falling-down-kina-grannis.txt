                        Bài hát: Stars Falling Down - Kina Grannis

I think that the stars would've waited 
For us
Hanging onto the night
Watching down below
Til we were hand in hand
Together waiting for them
So, when I open my eyes
I saw it too
Stars falling down
And I fell for you

I love you
I love you
I love you
I love you
I do

I think that the clouds like the laughter
Around us
Wanting to feel the warmth
That's softly sinking down
Til they cover the streets
Like a dreamland
Right above us
They part so that I see through
Stars falling down
And I fell for you

I love you
I love you
I love you
I love you
I do
I do
I do
I do
I love you
I love you
I do
I do love you
Love
I love you
I love you
I do
                        
                    |
