                        Bài hát: Scandinavia - Michael Learns To Rock

You made us wonderful
You made us wonderful

Leaving on an aeroplane
in the mood of april rain
The one and only
fills your heart
when you are lonely

We played a show with great routine
so many faces we have seen
and sometimes
you wonder
was just a dream

Chorus:
The Little Mermaid in Copenhagen
turns to gold in the morning sun
We are gently flying in from Asia
'Cause we belong in Scandinavia


We all prepare for landing now
Watching the blue sky with no clouds
The cabin crew
takes a photograph
standing next to us

Chorus:
The Little Mermaid in Copenhagen
turns to gold in the morning sun
We are gently flying in from Asia
'Cause we belong in Scandinavia

You made us wonderful
You made us wonderful
                        
                    |
