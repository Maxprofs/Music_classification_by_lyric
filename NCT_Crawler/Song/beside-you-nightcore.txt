                        Bài hát: Beside You - Nightcore

Even if you were upside-down
I would be beside you
And your world were a strange thing found
I would be beside you
In my symbolised world 
I'm a beautiful girl
In my house on the hill 
There is room for you still 

When there's nothing but dark and sound
I will be beside you
When there's nothing but the long way 'round
I will be beside you

In my simplified world
We're a boy and a girl
In my house on the hill 
There is room for you still

I'll be everywhere you go, you go, you go
I'll be everywhere you go, you go, you go
In my symbolised world I'm a beautiful girl
In my house on the hill there is room for you still. 

When there's nothing but roaring sound
I will be beside you
When there's nothing but the long drop down
I will be beside you
When your fears are a swarm in the hive of your mind
When the tears of your love and your loss are entwined

I'll be everywhere you go, you go, you go
I'll be everywhere you go, you go, you go

In my symbolised world I'm a beautiful girl
In my house on the hill there is room for you still
I'll be everywhere you go, you go, you go
I'll be everywhere you go, you go, you go
                        
                    |
