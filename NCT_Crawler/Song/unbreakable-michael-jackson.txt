                        Now I'm just wondering why you think 
that you can get to me with anything 
seems like you'd know by now 
When and how I get down 
And with all that I've been through, 
I'm still around 

Don't you ever make no mistake 
Baby I've got what it takes 
And there's no way you'll ever get to me 
Why can't you see that you'll never ever hurt me 
'cause I wont let it be, see I'm too much for you baby 

[CHORUS]
You can't believe it, you can't conceive it 
and you can't touch me, 'cause I'm untouchable 
and I know you hate it, and you can't take it 
You'll never break me, 'cause I'm unbreakable 

Now you can't stop me even thought you think 
that if you block me, you've done your thing 
and when you bury me underneath all your pain 
I ÃÅm steady laughin', while surfacing 

Don't you ever make no mistake 
baby I've got what it takes 
and there's no way you'll ever get to me 
Why can't you see that you'll never ever hurt me 
'cause I wont let it be, see I'm too much for you baby 

[CHORUS 2x]

You can try to stop me, but it wont do a thing 
no matter what you do, I'm still gonna be here 
Through all your lies and silly games 
I'm a still remain the same,I'm unbreakable 

[Notorious B.I.G.]
Uh, uh, what, uh
A lime to a lemon, my D.C. women
Bringin in ten G minimums to condos with elevators in 'em
Vehicles with televisions in 'em
Watch they entourage turn yours to just mirages
Disappearing acts, strictly nines and macs
Killers be serial, Copperfield material
My dreams is vivid, work hard to live it
Any place I visit, I got land there
How can players stand there and say I sound like them
HELLO?!
Push wigs back and push six Coupes that's yellow
Plus clips that expand from hand to elbow
Spray up your Day's Inn, any 'telle you in
Crack braggin sick of braggin how my mink be draggin
Desert ease street sweeper inside the beamer wagon
I rely on Bed-Stuy to shut it down if I die
Put that on my diamond bezel, you're messin with the devil
WHAT!!

[CHORUS 3x]
                        
                    |
