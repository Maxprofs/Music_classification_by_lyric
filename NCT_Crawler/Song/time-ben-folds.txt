                        Think of me anyway you want
 I can be the problem, if that's easier In your head, move the pieces around
 Things I've said, turn the memory upside down And it makes it better, I know
 But sometimes it's hard to swallow And in time I will fade away
 And in time I won't hear what you say
 In time, but time takes time you know Tell your friends the things they wanna hear and see
 Start the drums, band against the enemy And in time I will fade away
 In time I won't care what you say
 In time, but time takes time you know In your head, move the pieces round
 Things I've said, turn the memory upside down It might make it better, I know
 But sometimes it's hard to swallow In time I will fade away
 In time I won't care what you say
 And in time, but time takes time you know
 Time takes time you know
