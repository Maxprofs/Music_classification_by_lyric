                        Everybody makes mistakes... Everybody has those days... 1 2 3 4!
Everybody makes mistakes... Everybody has those days... Everybody knows what what I'm talkin' 'bout... Everybody gets that way... [x2]

Sometimes I'm in a jam
I've gotta make a plan
It might be crazy
I do it anyway
No way to know for sure
I'll figure out a cure
I'm patchin' up the holes
But then it overflows
If I'm not doin' to well
Why be so hard on my self?

[Chorus]
Nobody's Perfect!
I gotta work it!
Again and again 'til I get it right
Nobody's Perfect!
You live and you learn it!
And if I mess it up sometimes...
Nobody's perfect

Sometimes I work a scheme
But then it flips on me
Doesn't turn out how I planned
get stuck in quick sand
No problem, can be solved
Once I get involved
I try to be delicate
Then crash right into it
My intentions are good
Sometimes just misunderstood

[Chorus]

Nobody's perfect!
I gotta work it!
I know in time I'll find a way
Nobody's perfect!

Sometimes I fix things up
And they fall apart again
Nobody's perfect

I might mix things up
But I always get it right in the end

[Talking]
Next time you feel like... it's just one of those days...
when you just can't seem to win
If things don't turn out the way you plan,
FIGURE SOMETHING ELSE OUT!
Don't stay down! Try again! YEAH!

[Singing (x2)]
Everybody makes mistakes.....
everybody has those days.....
everybody knows what, what I'm talkin' 'bout.......
everybody gets that way

Nobody's Perfect!
I gotta work it!
Again and again 'til I get it right!
Nobody's Perfect!
Ya live and ya learn it!
And if I mess it up sometimes...
Nobody's Perfect!
I gotta work it!
I know in time I'll find a way
Nobody's Perfect.
Ya live and ya learn it!
'Cause everybody makes mistakes
Nobody's Perfect!
Nobody's Perfect! No no! Nobody's Perfect!
                        
                    |
