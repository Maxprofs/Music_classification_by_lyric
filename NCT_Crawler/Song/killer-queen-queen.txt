Artist : Queen
Album : Sheer Heart Attack
Title : Killer Queen

She keeps Moet et Chandon
in her pretty cabinet.
" Let them eat cake ! " , she says
just like Marie Antoinette.
A built-in remedy
for Kruschev and Kennedy
at anytime an invitation
you can't decline.
Caviar and cigarettes,
well versed in etiquette
extraordinarily nice.
She's a Killer
Queen Gunpowder,
gelatine.
Dynamite with a Laser Beam,
guaranteed to blow your mind.
{ Anytime ! }
Recommended at the price,
insatiable an appetite.
{ Wanna try ? }

To avoid complications,
she never kept the same address.
In conversation,
she spoke just like a Baroness.
Met a man from China,
went down to Geisha Minah.
Then again incidentally
if you're that way inclined.
Perfume came naturally from Paris.
For cars she couldn't careless,
fastidious and precise.
She's a Killer
Queen Gunpowder,
gelatine.
Dynamite with a Laser Beam,
guaranteed to blow your mind.
{ Anytime ! }

Drop of a hat she's as willing as
playful as a pussy cat.
Then momentarily out of action,
temporarily out of gas.
To absolutely
{ drive you wild. }
{ Wild ! }
She's all out to get you.
She's a Killer
Queen Gunpowder,
gelatine.
Dynamite with a Laser Beam,
guaranteed to blow your mind.
{ Anytime ! }
Recommended at the price,
insatiable an appetite.
 { Wanna try ? }

You wanna try...
