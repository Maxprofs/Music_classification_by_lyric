                        See my eyes are watching
Hear my heartbeat is pounding
Whatever I do wherever
I go It’s for you
See my days without you
I feel no shame in crying
Whatever it takes you know that
I’ll be with you

Now that I see the light
Now that I touch my light
Now that I realize all I ever wanted is only you

Now that I see the light (and life)
Now that I touch my light (and life)
Now that I realize all I ever wanted is only you

Now that I realize
                        
                    |
