                        No no no no, no no no no, no no no no, 

Listen little child, there will come a day 
When you will be able, able to say 
Never mind the pain, or the aggravation 
You know there's a better way, for you and me to be 

Look for a rainbow in every storm 
Fly like an angel, heaven sent to me 

Goodbye my friend (I know you're gone, you said you're gone, 
but I can still feel you here) 
It's not the end (gotta keep it strong before the pain 
turns into fear) 

So glad we made it, time will never change it - no no no 

No no no no 

Just a little girl, big imagination 
Never letting no-one take it away 
Went into the world, what a revelation 
She found there's a better way for you and me to be 

Look for a rainbow in every storm 
Find out for certain, love's gonna be there for you 
You'll always be someone's baby 

Goodbye my friend (I know you're gone, you said you're gone, 
but I can still feel you here) 
It's not the end (gotta keep it strong before the pain 
turns into fear) 

So glad we made it, time will never change it 
No no no no 
You know it's time to say goodbye 
No no no no 

(bridge) 

The times when we would play about 
The way we used to scream and shout 
We never dreamt you'd go your own sweet way 

Look for a rainbow in every storm 
Find out for certain love's gonna be there for you 
You'll always be someone's baby 

Goodbye my friend (I know your gone, you said you're gone, 
but I can still feel you here) 
It's not the end (you gotta keep it strong before the 
pain turns to fear) 

So glad we made it time will never never change it 

No no no no 
you know it's time to say goodbye 
No no no no 
and don't forget you can rely 

No no no no 
you know it's time to say goodbye 
No no no no 
and don't forget on me you can rely 

No no no no 
I will help, help you on your way 

No no no no 
I will be with you every day
