                        Bài hát : Stay High - Against The Current

Staying in my play pretend
Where the fun it got no end
Can't go home alone again
Need someone to numb the pain.

Staying in my play pretend
Where the fun it got no end
Can't go home alone again
Need someone to numb the pain

You're gone and I gotta stay
High all the time
To keep you off my mind
High all the time
To keep you off my mind
Spend my days locked in a haze
Tryna forget you, babe
I fall back down
Gotta stay high all my life
To forget I'm missing you.

Staying in my play pretend
Where the fun it got no end
Can't go home alone again
Need someone to numb the pain

You're gone and I gotta stay
High all the time
To keep you off my mind
High all the time
To keep you off my mind
Spend my days locked in a haze
Tryna forget you, babe
I fall back down
Gotta stay high all my life
To forget I'm missing you.
