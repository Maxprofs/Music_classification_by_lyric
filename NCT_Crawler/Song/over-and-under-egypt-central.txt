Âu Mỹ khác|

                        I know you'll be there
To see the tables turning
Wake up tomorrow
And watch the bridges burning

Pre-chorus I can see
I can see it in your eyes
I can feel
I can feel it in my mind
I don't care
I don't care if you realize
What you see
What you see in my eyes

Chorus I'm over me being under you
I'm breaking free I'm breaking through
I've overcome all I'm underneath
I can finally stand
I can finally breathe

Remember when we
First had the thought of living
A perfect picture
But I did all the giving
Gave up my passions
To try to make you happy
The joke is over
And I'll do all the laughing
                        
                    |
