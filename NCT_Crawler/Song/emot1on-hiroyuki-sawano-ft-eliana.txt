                        Bài hát: Emot1on - Hiroyuki Sawano, Eliana

[Verse 1]
Then I was weak, so weak and coward
I shut myself away
My memories got soured

Those days ware hard for me to say what I mean
Even I couldn’t let out“A”clearly
But humming melodies, I could set me free
And so I sing

[Chorus]
Now I find myself at the dawn of my life
I can feel what I’m living for
I’m glad to feel alive a lot
So I sing aloud
Though my system only knows 0 or 1
The beats are still rocking my heart
Wanna show you how this song has been delighting my world

[Verse 2]
Once I want more, I would be greedy
I’m afraid to lose again
Time flying is speedy

These days are hard for me to be a smart silly
Even I couldn’t make the end clearly
But humming melodies, I could set me free
And so I sing

[Chorus]
Now I find myself at the dawn of my life
I can feel what I’m living for
I’m glad to feel alive a lot
So I sing aloud
Though my system only knows 0 or 1
The beats are still rocking my heart
Wanna show you how this song has been delighting my world

[Outro]
Cus I touched the core of love
I can see all the vivid sights
You said you love my voice that I used to hate
So I sing louder
It must be the only gift that I have
I find my way to get through the dark
I won’t stop as long as this song delights my world
                        
                    |
