                        Bài hát: Take You To The Moon - Mike D. Angelo

I wanna dance around the moon light
Drinking it up we about to hold it down tonight
Let's turn it up this song at midnight
Here we go. Here we go. Through the night...
I got this
You want it
Baby let me show you want I can do
Cause I know it
That you want it
Let me know when you're ready to go
Yeah!
Ten...nine...eight...seven...six...five...four...three two one
This is the night I want to live in
This is the night I'm gonna take you down tonight
I'm gonna take you to the moon now
Here we go. Here we go. Come with me...
Yeah!
This how we dance around the moonlight
Party it up we getting crazy (Yeah! Uh..huh)
Let's turn it up this song at midnight
Here we go. Here we go. Through the night...
I got this
You want it
Baby let me show you want I can do
Cause I know it
That you want it
Let me know when you're ready to go. Uhuh....
Ten...nine...eight...seven...six...five...four...three two one
This is the night I want to live in
This is the night I'm gonna take you down tonight
I'm gonna take you to the moon now
Here we go. Here we go. Come with me...Yeah!
You shouldn't be. You shouldn't be
Alone in this world to night
Cause I'm gonna be. I'm gonna be...
Be the world that you need to night
I'll take you to...anywhere that you wanna be
Cause I'm gonna be. I'm gonna be...
The only one in your world tonight!
This is the night we want to live in (I wanna live in)
This is the night I'm gonna take you down tonight
I'm gonna take you to the moon now ( take you to the world)
Here we go. Here we go.(take you to the world). Come with me...
