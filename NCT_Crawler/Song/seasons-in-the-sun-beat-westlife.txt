                        Bài hát: Seasons In The Sun - Westlife

Goodbye to you, my trusted friend 
We've known each other since we were nine or ten 
Together we climbed hills and trees 
Learned of Love and ABC's 
Skinned our hearts and skinned our knees 

Goodbye my friend, it's hard to die 
When all the birds are singing in the sky 
Now that the spring is in the air 
Pretty girls are everywhere 
Think of me and I’ll be there 

We had joy, we had fun, we had Seasons in the sun 
But the hills that we climbed were just Seasons out of time 

Goodbye Papa, please pray for me 
I was the Black Sheep of the Family 
You tried to teach me right from wrong 
Too much wine and too much song 
Wonder how I got along 

Goodbye Papa, it's hard to die 
When all the bird's are singing in the sky 
Now that the spring is in the air 
Little Children everywhere 
When you see them I'll be there 

We had joy, we had fun, we had Seasons in the sun 
But the wine and the song like the Seasons have all gone 

We had joy, we had fun, we had Seasons in the sun 
But the wine and the song, like the Seasons, have all gone 

Goodbye Michelle, my little one 
You gave me Love and helped me find the sun 
And every time when I was down 
You would always come around 
And get my feet back on the ground 

Goodbye Michelle, it's hard to die 
When all the birds are singing in the sky 
Now that the spring is in the air 
With the flowers everywhere 
I wish that we could both be there 

All our lives we had fun, we had Seasons in the sun 
But the stars we could reach were just starfish on the beach 

We had joy, we had fun, we had Seasons in the sun 
But the stars we could reach were just starfish on the beach 

We had joy, we had fun, we had Seasons in the sun 
But the wine and the song, like the Seasons, have all gone
                        
                    |
