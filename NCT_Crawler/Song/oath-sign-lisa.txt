                        Bài hát: Oath Sign - Lisa

Kurikaesu sekai Nando te wo nobashitara 
Hakanai namida wa kuroi kokoro tokasu no?

In the repeating world, if I reach out my hand a number of times 
Will my fleeting teardrops melt your black heart?

Mebae dashita omoi ga mune ni hibiita nara 
Kimi no tonari de zutto kawarazu mamoru darou

If these budding feelings echo in my heart 
Then I'm sure I'll be able to protect you at your side with no change.

Ochita kibou wo hirotte Asu ni tsunaide yukeba 
Karamatta ibitsuna negai datte hodokeru

If I pick up the fallen hope and connect it to tomorrow, 
I can even untangle a knotted, twisted-up wish.

Hikari wo kazashite tamerai wo keshita 
Agetakatta no wa mirai de 
Naiteru yoru daita mama nageki wo sakende

I held the light above me and erased my doubts. 
What I wanted in the future 
Was to hold you in the night as you cried and screamed your despair.

Fumiireta ashi wo tooku no risou ga 
Sotto iyashite yuku 
Tashikana kizuna wo tsuyoku nigiri susumou dokomademo 
Kegare kitta kiseki wo se ni

My feet I moved in are 
Softly healed by my faraway ideals. 
I grip tightly onto these certain bonds and move ahead, no matter where, 
The miracle that cut through the impurity on my back.

Tsukurareta omoi furereba nani yori mo 
Atatakakute genjitsu ga kasumi hajimeru

If I touch these feelings that were created, then more than anything 
It starts to mist up the warm reality.

Kurui dashita sekai ni toikake tsuzuketemo 
Kotae nante denai tte Mou kimi wa shitteita no?

Even if you keep asking the confused world, 
You already knew it wouldn't give an answer, didn't you?

Naite nijinda negai wa Kesshite yurugi wa shinakute 
Tada sotto itami wo owarinaku ataeru

The wish that I made that dripped down as I cried will never show any wavering. 
It just softly gives me endless pain.

Kanashimi wo shitte Yorokobi mo shitta 
Yowasa wa kimi wo kaete 
Tachidomatta toki Hagare subete wo kowashita

You learned sadness and happiness, 
But weakness changed you. 
You threw off the time the stopped and destroyed everything.

Todoku hazu no nai kotoba wo takushite 
Mieta hitomi wa 
Nani wo kanjite toozakeru no? 
Kokoro kakusu youni

You entrusted the words that should not have been able to reach to me. 
What do those eyes I see feel that makes 
Them distance themselves. 
It's as if you're hiding your heart.

Ima koko ni iru imi 
Oshiete kureta nara 
Tsuyoku irareru Kawarazu itsumo

If you've taught me 
The reason I am here, 
I can stay strong without change, forever.

Hikari wo kazashite tamerai wo keshita 
Agetakatta no wa mirai de 
Naiteru yoru daita mama nageki wo sakende

I held the light above me and erased my doubts. 
What I wanted in the future 
Was to hold you in the night as you cried and screamed your despair.

Fumiireta ashi wo tooku no risou ga 
Sotto iyashite yuku 
Tashikana kizuna wo tsuyoku nigiri susumou dokomademo

My feet I moved in are 
Softly healed by my faraway ideals. 
I grip tightly onto these certain bonds and move ahead, no matter where,

Mayoi nante me wo hiraite 
Furi haratte te wo nobasou 
Kegare kitta kiseki wo se ni

Wavering opens my eyes. 
I'll shake it all off and reach out my hand, 
The miracle that cut through the impurity on my back.
                        
                    |
