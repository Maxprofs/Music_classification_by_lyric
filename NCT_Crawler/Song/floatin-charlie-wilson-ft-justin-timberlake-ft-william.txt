                        I, I'm not sure just how to say this to you
 The words just don't come out right
 But that doesn't mean
 That I don't feel somethin' for ya You gotta understand that love
 Love was something I knew nothing about
 Until I met you but you, girl
 You're the one that turned my heart around
 And for that I love you I'm walking on the sky
 Girl, you're making me high
 My feet can hardly touch the ground
 Oh damn, I'm mesmerized I'm floatin' on the sky
 Girl, you're making me high
 My feet can hardly touch the ground
 Oh damn, I'm mesmerized I tried everything I knew from before
 She broke my technique and now my heart is sore
 I'm on cloud nine and I want some more
 She got me floatin' I had to say do do, do do, do do, do do, do do
 Say, do do, do do, do do
 If you're in love let me hear you say
 Do do, do do, do do, do do, do
 Say, do do, do do, do do
 If you're in love Said, hey, girl
 I just can't seem to take my eyes off of you
 (But who could blame me?)
 'Cause when I look into those baby blues
 I can feel my heart fall to the ground
 And for that I love you I'm walking on the sky
 Girl, you're making me high
 My feet can hardly touch the ground
 Oh damn, I'm mesmerized I'm floatin' on the sky
 Girl you're making me high
 My feet can hardly touch the ground
 Oh damn, I'm mesmerized I tried everything I knew from before
 She broke my technique and now my heart is sore
 I'm on cloud nine and I want some more
 She got me floatin' I had to say do do, do do, do do, do do, do do
 Say, do do, do do, do do
 If you're in love let me hear you say
 Do do, do do, do do, do do, do
 Say, do do, do do, do do
 If you're in love Girl, you got me walkin' on the sky
 Sho' 'nuff make a brother feel high
 And it feels like I'm floatin'
 But I ain't smokin' dope One day I hope you could tell me why
 Why the sun don't shine when you're gone
 Baby, you've still got that thing to turn me on
 Like the first time I peeped ya, I wanted to freak ya
 And getcha up outta your thong I wanna freak ya, freak ya, freak freak ya
 Get kinky, put your booty on a speaker
 And when my waist go boom
 And the bass go boom Can I sequence the beat to treat ya?
 'Cause it's seven in the morning and it just don't stop
 And we've been at it since eleven o'clock
 The chocolate rabbit with the hip pity hop
 Makin' love letcha flow I tried everything I knew from before
 She broke my technique and now my heart is sore
 I'm on cloud nine and I want some more
 She got me floatin' I had to say do do, do do, do do, do do, do do
 Say do do, do do, do do
 I'm floatin' do do, do do
 (Floatin' on the sky, yeah, yeah)
 Do do, do do, do do Say do do, do do, do do
 If you're in love
 Do do, do do, do do, do do, do
 Say, do do, do do, do do
 If you're in love Uncle Charlie, preach
