                        Bài hát: Elastic Heart / Love Me Like You Do - Conor Maynard

And another one bites the dust 
Oh why can I not conquer love?
And I might have thought that we were one
Wanted to fight this war without weapons 
And I wanted it, I wanted it bad
But there were so many red flags
And another one bites the dust

Now let’s be clear, I’ll trust no one 
You did not break me
I’m still fighting for peace 
Well, I’ve got thick skin and an elastic heart
 But your blade it might be too sharp

I’m like a rubber band until you pull too hard
But I may snap and I move fast
You won’t see me fall apart
‘Cause I’ve got an elastic heart
I’ve got an elastic heart 

Yeah, I’ve got an elastic heart
So love me like you do
Love love love me like you do 
So love me like you do
Love love love me like you do
Touch me like you do 
Touch touch touch me like you do

Oh what are you waiting for
‘Cause I’m too hot
Called a police and a fireman
I’m too hot
Make a dragon wanna retire, man
I’m too hot 
Say my name you know who

I am I’m too hot I’m too hot
Saying why were you creeping around late last night?
Why did I see two shadows moving in your bedroom light?
Now you’re dressed in black
When I left you were dressed in white 
Can you fill me in? 
Can you fill me in?
I’ve got an elastic heart
                        
                    |
