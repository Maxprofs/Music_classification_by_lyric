                        Magic moments
 When two hearts are carin'
 Magic moments
 Memories we've been sharin' I'll never forget the moment we kissed
 The night of the hayride
 The way that we hugged to try to keep warm
 While takin' a sleigh ride Magic moments
 Memories we've been sharin'
 Magic moments
 When two hearts are carin' Time can't erase the memory
 Of these magic moments
 Filled with love The telephone call that tied up the line
 For hours and hours
 The Saturday dance, I got up the nerve
 To send you some flowers Magic moments
 Memories we've been sharin'
 Magic moments
 When two hearts are carin' Time can't erase the memory
 Of these magic moments
 Filled with love The way that we cheered whenever our team
 Was scoring a touchdown
 The time that the floor fell out of my car
 When I put the clutch down The penny arcade, the games that we played
 The fun and the prizes
 The halloween hop when everyone came
 In funny disguises Magic, moments
 Filled with love
