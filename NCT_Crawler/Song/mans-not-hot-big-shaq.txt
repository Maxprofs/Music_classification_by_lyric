                        Bài hát: Man'S Not Hot - Big Shaq

Big Shaq 
The one and only man's not hot , never hurt 

2+2 is 4, minus 1 that's 3 quick maths
Everyday man's on the block, smoke trees
See your girl in the park, that girl is a uckers
When the ting went quack-quack-quack, you men were ducking
Hold tight Assney, he's got a pumpy
Hold tight my man, he's got a frisbee

I trap trap trap on the road, movin' that cornflakes
Rice Krispie, hold tight my girl Whitney
On the road doin' ten toes, 'llow my toes
You man thought I froze
I see a peng-girl then I pose
If she's not on it I ghost
Hah, look at your nose

What?
You ***
Look at your nose
Nose look like garden hose, shhhh, you get me?
Boom, man's gonna come back in
You know like that, you feelin' that
You dun know, I see you shiverin' and that

Don't get shook man's here you protected-ed
Aight, boom
Let's go, boom
Hop out the four door with the 44 it was 1, 2, 3 and 4
Chillin' in the corridor, your dad is 44
And he still calling man for a draw
Let him know, when I see him, I'm gonna spin his jaw
Take my Twix by force, sad man shop by force

Your girl knows I've got the sauce, no ketchup
Just sauce, raw sauce
Boom, yo, gah
Da ting go skkkkrrrraaa, papakakaka
Skivipipopop and a poopooturrrboom
Skrra, tutukukututoom, poompoom
You dun know, Big Shaq
Ha, yo, yeah yeah
Alright, fire-fire-fire in the booth

You get me, man's not hot
I tell her man's not hot
I tell her man's not hot
The girl told me take off your jacket
I said babes, man's not hot
Yo, man can never be hot
Perspiration ting, Lynx effect
Yo, you dun know
