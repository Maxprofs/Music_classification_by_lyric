                        Bài hát: I Do It For You (Everything I Do) - Bryan Adams

Look into my eyes
You will see, what you mean to me
Search your heart, search your soul
When you find me then, you'll search no more.

Don't tell me it's not worth trying for
You can’t tell me it’s not worth dying for
You know its true, everything I do, I do it for you!

Look into your heart, you will find
There’s nothing there to hide
Take me as I am, take my life
I would give it all, I would sacrifice

Don’t tell me it’s not worth fighting for
I can’t help it, there’s nothing i want more
You know its true, everything I do, I do it for you!

There is no love, like your love
And no other, could give me more love
There’s nowhere, unless you're there
All the time, all the way... yeah...

Oh.. you can’t tell me it’s not worth trying for
Just can’t help it, there’s nothing in the world i want more
yeah .. I would fight for you, I'd lie for you
Walk the wire for you, yeah I'd die for you

You know it’s true
Everything I do, Oh... I do it for you!!!
