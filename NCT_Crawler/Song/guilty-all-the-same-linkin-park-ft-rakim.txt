                        Bài hát : Guilty All The Same - Linkin Park, Rakim

Tell us all again
What you think we should be
What the answers are 
What it is we can't see

Tell us all again
How to do what you say?
How to fall in line 
How there's no other way

But.... Ohh

We all know

You're guilty all the same
Too sick to be ashamed 
You want to point your finger 
But there's no one else to blame

You're guilty all the same
Too sick to be ashamed 
You want to point your finger 
But there's no one else to blame

You're guilty all the same....!!

Show us all again
That our hands are unclean
That we're unprepared
Thay you have what we need 

Show us all again
'cause we cannot be saved 
'cause the end is near 
Now there's no other way

And....ohhh....!!

You will know....

You're guilty all the same
Too sick to be ashamed 
You want to point your finger 
But there's no one else to blame

You're guilty all the same
Too sick to be ashamed 
You want to point your finger 
But there's no one else to blame

There's no one else to blame

Guilty all the same
Guilty all the same

You're guilty all the same
(Rakim):
Can y'all explain
What kind of land is this
When a man has plans of being rich
But the bosses plans is wealthy 
Dirty money scheme 
A clean split is nonsense
It's insane
Even corporate hands is filthy 
They takl team and take the paper route 
All they think about is bank accounts 
Assets and realty
At anybody's expense
No shame with a clear conscience
No gerets and guil free
They claim that ain't the way that thay built me
The smoke screen before the flame
Knowin' as soon as dough or the deal peak
They say it's time for things to change 
Rearranger like good product rebuilt cheap
Anything if it's more to again
Drained, manipulated like artists, it's real deep
Until no more remains but i'm still me 
Like authentic Hip-Hop and Rock
Til Pop and radio and record companies killed me
Try to force me to stray and obey
And got the gall to say how real can real be
You fell me, we'll see
That green could be to blame
Or greedy for the fame
TV or a name , the media, the game 
To me you're all the same 
You're guilty ......

(Chester):
You're guilty all the same
Too sick to be ashamed 
You want to point your finger 
But there's no one else to blame

You're guilty all the same
Too sick to be ashamed 
You want to point your finger 
But there's no one else to blame

There's no one else to blame

Guilty all the same
guilty all the same
guilty all the same............................!!!
