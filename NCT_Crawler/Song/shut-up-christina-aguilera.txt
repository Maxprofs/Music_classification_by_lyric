                        Song: Shut Up
 Artist: Christina Aguilera
You've got some nerve, 
now baby don't you

I never care bout half the sh*t that comes out 
of your mouth, no
I wish that I could put a swift choke-hold on you

This world ain't big enough for you
 and your ego

So for once why don't you just
Shut up, just shut the f*ck up 
Keep running, running, running and running your mouth
Could you please
Shut up, just shut the f*ck up 
You think you're something special don't you

You like the sound of your voice, 
keep talking while 
I tune out (oh)
And if you ever really wonder what I think about you

I've got a million ways to show you just where you can go
*** (oh)

So for once why don't you just
Shut up, just shut the f*ck up 
Keep running, running, running and running your mouth
Could you please
Shut up, just shut the f*ck up 
Shut up,
Call me a b*tch whenever you wish
Don't give a sh*t, can you handle it
Cause I flip the script, don't seal my lips
And if you don't like it
You can suck my (ugh) 
One, two, three, four

(Hey, oh, yea yeah)

Shut up, just shut the f*ck up 
Keep running, running, running and running your mouth
Could you please
Shut up, just shut the f*ck up
