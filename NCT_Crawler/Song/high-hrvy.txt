                        Bài hát: High - HRVY

[Verse 1]
You and me against the world
Imma take you with me girl
Baby come with me, baby come with me
Life's a game of truth or dare
And it don't matter I don't care
Baby come with me, baby come with me

[Hook]
I got that hot life I wanna show ya
I'll take you places you've never seen
And when you wake up here on my shoulder
You'll be here with me, you'll be here with me

[Chorus]
(I wanna get high)
Just high enough to fall for you
(I wanna get high)
And we can make the memories, the scrapbook of our lives
Is this the start of you and me?
(I wanna get high, I wanna get high)
Get high together
Get high together
Get high together

[Verse 2]
You and me against the rules
Nothing but incredible
Girl when you're with me, girl when you're with me (Oh)
Rolling up in paradise
Lighting up your pretty eyes
Girl when you're with me, girl when you're with me (Oh)

[Hook]
I got that hot life I wanna show ya
I'll take you places you've never seen
And when you wake up here on my shoulder
You'll be here with me, you'll be here with me

[Chorus]
(I wanna get high)
Just high enough to fall for you
(I wanna get high)
And we can make the memories, the scrapbook of our lives
Is this the start of you and me?
(I wanna get high, I wanna get high)
Get high together
Get high together
Get high together
Get high together
Get high together

[Hook]
(I wanna get high)
Just high enough to fall for you
(I wanna get high)
And we can make the memories, the scrapbook of our lives (Ohhh)
I wanna get high (I wanna get high)
Get high together

[Chorus]
(I wanna get high)
Just high enough to fall for you
(I wanna get high)
And we can make the memories, the scrapbook of our lives
Is this the start of you and me?
(I wanna get high, I wanna get high)
Get high together
Get high together
Get high together
Get high together
Get high together

[Outro]
You and me against the world
Imma take you with me girl
Baby come with me.
