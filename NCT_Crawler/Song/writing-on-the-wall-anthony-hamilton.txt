                        people talking about how you run around
 talking about how you are living life
 i tell you i just can't complain
 got me feeling good you got me misunderstood
 i wish you would try to understand everything
 take a ride in the .. don't wanna listen
 i don't wanna listen people talking every where
 i don't wanna listen but i hear
 you go to hollywood misses hollywood
 .. down the .. mind your business if she ain't or she is i don't wanna know
 writing on the wall .. i don't wanna miss it
 people talking everywhere when the smoke .. begin to clear
 i don't wanna listen it's alright
 is my life is my life
 is alright and i am wrong
 writing on the wall .. i don't wanna miss it
 people talking everywhere when the smoke .. begin to clear
 i don't wanna listen it's alright
 is my life is my life
 is alright and i am wrong
