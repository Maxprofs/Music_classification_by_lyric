You know, we young OG's so we made a lot of old money

Raindrop, drop top (drop top)
Smokin' on cookie in the hotbox (cookie)
Fuckin' on your bitch she a thot, thot (thot)
Cookin' up dope in the crockpot (pot)
We came from nothin' to somethin' nigga (hey)
I don't trust nobody grip the trigger (nobody)
Call up the gang, and they come and get you (gang)
Cry me a river, give you a tissue (hey)
My bitch is bad and boujee (bad)
Cookin' up dope with an Uzi (blaow)

She say she diggin' my style, picked the money off the ground
All of my niggas around, loud, smokin' the clouds
Niggas be talkin' that *** but these niggas not what they say they be 'bout
All of my bitches be down, all of you niggas is clowns

[Verse 2: Fabolous]
Yeah, you cannot check for me now
'Less you got a check for me now
Hol' up, let me go check my account
Hol' up, these fakes niggas checks always bounce
Your bitch be checkin' me out
Watchin' and checkin' my routes
Bitches be robbin' niggas
You better check at the house
I'm tryna be the hoe dentist
I'm tryna check on her mouth
Do the sound check on the couch
Get out, I'm chuckin' 'em out
Ratchet chick thinkin' she boujee
'Cause we went out to eat sushi
I know that she on my dick though
She Angela Yee and I'm Gucci
In Hollywood rockin' hoodies
With a baddy smokin' goody
My money tall, 7 footy
That's why the Kid get the Cudi
Nine milli, that's my buddy
Turn your face to silly putty
I'm sauchin' on 'em 'til it smother
I'm drippin' on 'em 'til it's flooded, woo
My new name is Damn You Killed That, Lay
You love me but I don't feel that way
Don't play 'bout my money 'cause that's bae
Hate what you want, get rich that way
Found somethin' you can do that pay
They call me Oggie and that's Trey
We levelled up nigga, that way
