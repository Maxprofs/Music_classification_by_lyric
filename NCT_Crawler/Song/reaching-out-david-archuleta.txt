                        What must I do to make you understand
You mean everything to me
Don't have the strength to say
Give this heart of mine a chance
And maybe then you will see
That I'll do anything, do anything that you tell me
I'll be there, I'll be there, if you need me

Reaching out to you
Do you feel it to
Loving you is all I wanna do
I'm completely sure
I've never felt this way before
When I smile, you know that there is something more
Ohh

What must I do, so I can make you see
The light that shines in my eyes
You brighten up my day
You even help me find my way

I wish you're always by my side
And I cant stop, don't know how to stop thinking of you
I'll do anything, do anything to be near you

Reaching out to you
Do you feel it to
Loving you is all I wanna do
I'm completely sure
I've never felt this way before
When I smile, you know that there is something more
Something more

Reaching out to you
Do you feel it to
Loving you is all I wanna do
I'm completely sure
I've never felt this way before
Deep inside you know that there is something more
Deep inside you know that there is something more
                        
                    |
