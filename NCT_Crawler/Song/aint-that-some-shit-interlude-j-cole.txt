                        Okay I lied Motherfucker try
 Say I can't come to the hood, true lie
 See I would but I'm out in Dubai
 When I get back I'mma roll through that
 Snatch yo bitch give yo niggas dap

 Shake yo momma's hand and kissed it
 This pimp ***, pimp ***

 Pullin' that trigger nigga better be a head shot
