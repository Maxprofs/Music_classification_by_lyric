                        It's been a long day
 I can't seem to get up again
 I want to fall asleep
 So I don't have to remember! Don't have to call me, I turned my phone off
 Let the pillows to protect my heart
 You don't have to check up on me, I'll be alright
 I turned off the lights and sweep into the night I keep falling
 I keep falling, uh
 I keep falling apart!
 I keep falling (falling)
 I keep falling (falling)
 I keep falling (falling)
 I keep falling for you! I wanna forget
 All this burden in my past
 I want to fall asleep
 So I don't have to remember! Don't have to call me, I turned my phone off
 Let the pillows to protect my heart
 You don't have to check up on me, I'll be alright
 I turned off the lights and sweep into the night I keep falling
 I keep falling, uh
 I keep falling apart!
 I keep falling (falling)
 I keep falling (falling)
 I keep falling (falling)
 I keep falling for you! We will start to fall on
 Forget, I forget it all!
 The rain will start to fall on
 I forget, I'll forget it all!
 We will start to fall on
 Forget, I forget it all!
 The rain will start to fall on
 I forget, I'll forget it all! Don't have to call me, I turned my phone off
 Let the pillows to protect my heart
 You don't have to check up on me, I'll be alright
 I turned off the lights and sweep into the night I keep falling
 I keep falling, uh
 I keep falling apart!
 I keep falling (falling)
 I keep falling (falling)
 I keep falling (falling)
 I keep falling for you!
