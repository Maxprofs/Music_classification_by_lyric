                        Bài hát: Dream On (Live At The Voice 2016) - Miley Cyrus, Alicia Keys, Adam Levine, Blake Shelton

Every time I look in the mirror 
All these lines on my face getting clearer 
The past is gone 
It went by, like dusk to the dawn 
Isn't that the way 
Everybody's got their dues in life to pay 

Yeah, I know nobody knows 
where it comes and where it goes 
I know it's everybody's sin 
You got to lose to know how to win 

Half my life's 
in books' written pages 
Lived and learned from fools and 
from sages 
You know it's true 
All the things come back to you 

Sing with me, sing for the year 
Sing for the laughter, sing for the tear 
Sing with me just for today 
Maybe tomorrow, the good lord will take you away 

Yeah, sing with me, sing for the year 
sing for the laughter, sing for the tear 
sing with me, just for today 
Maybe tomorrow, the good Lord will take you away 

Dream On Dream On Dream On 
Dream until your dream comes true 
Dream On Dream On Dream On 
Dream until your dream comes through 
Dream On Dream On Dream On 
Dream On Dream On 
Dream On Dream On, AHHHHHHH
