                        Summertime, and the livin' is easy
 Fish are jumpin' and the cotton is high
 Your daddy's rich and your ma is good-lookin'
 So hush little baby, don't you cry One of these mornings you're gonna rise up a-singing
 You're gonna spread your wings and away you'll fly, oh
 But 'till that morning, nothin' will harm you
 With daddy and mommy standin' by Summertime, and the livin' is easy
 Fish are jumpin' and the cotton is high
 Your daddy's rich and your ma, your ma is good-lookin'
 So hush little baby, don't you cry Summertime, summertime, summertime, summertime
 Summertime, ooh-ooh
