                        Song: Used To Love You
 Artist: John Legend
Maybe, it's me,
 maybe i bore you
No no, it's my fault, 
cos i can't afford you
Maybe baby, puffy, jay z
would all be better for you
Cos all i can do is love you

Baby when i used to love you
Theres' nothing that i wouldn't do
I went thru the fire for you, 
do anything you asked me to
But i tired of livin this lie
It's getting harder to justify
Realised that i just don't love you
Not like i used to

La la la

la la la

Maybe, i should rob somebody
So we could, 
live like whitney and bobby
It's probably my fault, my bad, my loss
But u are, above cost
Cos all i could do was love you

Baby when i used to love you
 theres' nothing that i wouldn't do
I went thru the fire for you, 
do anything you asked me to
But i'm tired of living this lie
It's getting harder to justify
Realised that i just don't love you
Not like i used to

Hola hola hola
Hola hola hola

Do you remember when i used to love you

Baby no not any more, love you
Ooohhhh, I love you
And you're gonna miss me now

Baby when i used to love you
There's nothing that i wouldn't do,
I went thru the fire for you 
and i'm not gonna play the fool
No i can't live this life, 
and i can't justify, 
and i can't make up my life
Cos i don't love you
Not like i used to do

Hola hola hola
Hola hola hola
Oh i used to love you
Oh but I don't love you
 I don't love you
