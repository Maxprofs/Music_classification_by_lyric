                        Bài hát: Cry On My Shoulder - Hòa Tấu, Sáo Trúc

If the hero never comes to you 
If you need someone you're feeling blue 
If you wait for love and you're alone 
If you call your friends nobody's home 

You can run away but you can't hide 
Through a storm and through a lonely night 
Then I'll show you there's a destiny 
The best things in life they are free 

But if you wanna cry 
Cry on my shoulder 
If you need someone 
Who cares for you 
If you're feeling sad 
Your heart gets colder 
Yes I show you what real love can do 

If your sky is grey oh, let me know 
There's a place in heaven where we'll go 
If heaven is a million years away Oh, just call me and I'll make your day 
When the nights are gettin' cold and blue 
When the days are gettin' hard for you 
I will always stay here by your side 
I promise you I'll never hide 

But if you wanna cry 
Cry on my shoulder 
If you need someone 
Who cares for you 
If you're feeling sad 
Your heart gets colder 
Yes I show you what real love can do 

But if you wanna cry 
Cry on my shoulder 
If you need someone 
Who cares for you 
If you're feeling sad 
Your heart gets colder 
Yes I show you what real love can doWhat real love can do 
What real love can do 
What love can do 
What love can do 
Love can do
