                        Bài hát : Divine Sorrow - Wyclef Jean, Avicii

Dearie blossom,
I've gone down to old rock bottom
Now I know the love in my heart was true!

Divine sorrow,
I thank you for the joy that follow
Back then my friend
If only you knew

It is harder when you love beyond belief
But I'm a fool to let you go
So this is for you MY LOVE!

We will never, we will never have a change of mind
We belong together!
We will never, we will never be the weary kind
We sing our SORROWS AWAY!

We sing our SORROWS AWAY!
We sing our SORROWS AWAY!

[Electronic break]
Divine blessing,
I wish I would've heard your lesson
Now I know your words were my only truth!

I'm just venting,
Or maybe I'm done confessing
Back then my friend
If only you knew

It is harder when you love beyond belief,
But I'm a fool to let you go
So this is for you MY LOVE!

We will never, we will never have a change of mind
We belong together!
We will never, we will never be the weary kind
We sing our SORROWS AWAY!

We can make it through Judgment Day,
We won't go fading away
All I ever know must be Heaven where you come from

We can make it through cloudy skies,
By your side I feel ALIVE
All I ever know must be Heaven where you come from, yeah!
