                        Bài hát: I Do (Lee's Version) - 911

Ver 1:
My whole world changed from the moment I met you
And it would never be the same
Felt like I knew that I'd always love you
From the moment I heard your name

Bridge 1:
Everything was perfect, I knew this love is worth it
Our own micracle in the makin'
'Til the world stops turning
I'll still be here waiting and waiting to make that vow that I'll...

Chorus:
I'll be by your side, 'til the day I die
I'll be waiting 'til hear you say I Do
Something old, something new
Something borrowed, something blue
I'll be waiting 'til I hear you say I Do

Ver 2:
Smiles by the thousands, ya tears have all dried out
'Cos I won't see you cry again
Throw pennies in the fountain, and look at what comes out
Sometimes wishes do come true

Bridge 1:
Everything was perfect, I knew this love is worth it
Our own micracle in the makin'
'Til the world stops turning
I'll still be here waiting and waiting to make that vow that I'll...

Chorus:
I'll be by your side, 'til the day I die
I'll be waiting 'til hear you say I Do
Something old, something new
Something borrowed, something blue
I'll be waiting 'til I hear you say I Do

Middle 8:
Always better than worse, protect you from the hurt
I'll be waiting 'til hear you say I Do
I Do love you, yes I Do love you
I'll be waiting 'til hear you say I Do
Coz I love you, love you ...

We're shining lie a diamond, just look at us now,
I wanna hear you say I Do
                        
                    |
