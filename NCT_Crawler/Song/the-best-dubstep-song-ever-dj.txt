[Harry]:
Maybe it's the way she walked
Straight into my heart and stole it
Through the doors and pass the guards,
Just like she already own it.

[Zayn]:
I said can you give it back to me?
She said never in your wildest dreams.

[Chorus]:
A nd we danced all night to the best song ever
I knew every lines now i can't remember
How it goes but i know that i won't forget her
'Cause we danced all night to the best song ever.

I think it went oh, oh, oh
I think it went yeah, yeah, yeah
I think it goes oes oes....so!

[Liam]:

And her daddy was a dentist

Sa id i had a dirty mouth (I got a dirty mouth)
But she kissed me like she meant it

[Niall]:
