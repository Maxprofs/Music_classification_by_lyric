                        There's no happy everafter
 Here we're just trying to survive Whole lotta trouble baby
 Whole lotta trouble baby
 Whole lotta trouble in this life Work and you could have your money
 But that don't guarantee you're right Whole lotta trouble baby
 Whole lotta trouble baby
 Whole lotta trouble in this life And the morning sun comes up
 And the evening sun goes down
 You think that I could make a life
 When everything keeps dying
 In this cold dark town Some folks just think you're starting over
 They take a lifetime to decide Whole lotta trouble baby
 Whole lotta trouble baby
 Whole lotta trouble in this Whole lotta trouble baby
 Whole lotta trouble baby
 Whole lotta trouble in this life
 In this life, in this life
 Whole lotta trouble baby, in this life
