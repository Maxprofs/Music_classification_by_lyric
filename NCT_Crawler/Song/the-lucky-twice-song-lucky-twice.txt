                        Lalala lalalalalalalalala
Lalala lalalalalalalalala 

I heard you're daddy said 
That I messed with your head
But I’m only setting you free
Your mommy’s uncool 
When I called you a fool
And she tried to blame it on me

CHORUS
They made you lucky once,
I'll make you lucky twice
I'm Lucky Twice I'll make you feel so good,
I'll make you feel so nice
I'm Lucky Twice

Oh oh
CHORUS

Lalala lalalalalalala 
Oh oh Lucky Twice
Lalala lalalalalalala
Oh oh Lucky Twice

I know how you feel so I make you a deal,
That I won’t be telling a soul
As soon as it’s dark meet me down in the park
It's good to be out of control

CHORUS (2)

When they say wrong
I say right
They say to drop it, I’m telling you to fight

Make or break
Do or die
You know that I'm all that you need

CHORUS (2)

Lalala lalalalalalala 
Oh oh Lucky Twice
Lalala lalalalalalala
Oh oh Lucky Twice

Oh oh Lucky Twice
                        
                    |
