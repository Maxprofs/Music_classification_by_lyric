                        Bài hát : How Many Drinks? (Explicit Version) - Miguel, Kendrick Lamar

[Miguel]
Frustration, watching you dance
Invitation, to get in them pants
Come closer baby, so I can touch
One question, am I movin' too fast?

Cause I ain't leavin' alone, I feel like I could be honest, babe
We both know that we're grown
That's why I wanna know

How many drinks would it take you to leave with me?
Yeah, you look good and I got money
But I don't wanna waste my time
Back of my mind I'm hopin' you say two or three
You look good, we came to party
But I don't wanna waste my time

Temptation, is calling your name
Sweet persuasion, oh, baby this is a game
Come closer, baby, if you like what you hear
Impression, is what I'm makin' you feel

Cause I ain't leavin' alone, I feel like I could be honest, babe
We both know that we're grown
That's why I wanna know

How many drinks would it take you to leave with me?
Yeah, you look good and I got money
But I don't wanna waste my time
Back of my mind I'm hopin' you say two or three
You look good, we came to party
But I don't wanna waste my time (waste my time)

[Kendrick Lamar]
Aha, and what do we have
Your empty heart and my empty bottle and yellow cab
That you are likely to catch cause your latest ex made you mad
So I figured the perfect catch would be you if I made the pass
Pool full of liquor then we dive - in it
Knowing if I lick her I might die - in it
Then reincarnate as a fly - gymnast
Just to flip my tongue on you
This the Olympics

State your name, live in the moment
It's your time to own it, I see it in you baby
She tell me that she never get a first let away

And life is a bitch, but every dog has its day
Holla pull up, pull up, bring it back, come rewind
Pull up them bittracks, that pack come behind
Pool full of liquor then we dive - in it
Pull 'em to the side, let me slide up in it

[Miguel]
Or waste your time, or waste your time
Or waste our time, baby it's alright
Baby it's alright, baby it's alright, yeah
Oh it's alright now
Alright, oh yeah
I don't wanna waste my time, no
I don't wanna waste my time, oh no
I don't wanna waste your time, baby
I don't wanna waste our time, oh my time, oh whoa

How many drinks would it take you to leave with me? (oh yeah)
Yeah you look good, and I got money
But I don't wanna waste my time (come with me baby)
Back of my mind, I'm hoping you say two or three (yeah it's just a short drive home from here)
You look good, we came to party
But I don't wanna waste my time

No no no, I ain't judgin' if you do decide that you might be *** tonight
What? More power to you if you do decide that you might be *** tonight
I ain't judgin' if you do decide that you might be *** tonight
What? More power to you if you do decide that you might be *** tonight
