                        Bài hát: Champion - Fall Out Boy

[Intro]
Champion, champion

[Verse 1]
I'm calling you from the future
To let you know we've made a mistake
And there's a fog from the past that's giving me, giving me such a headache

And I'm back with a madness
I'm a champion of the people who don't believe in champions
I got nothing but dreams inside, I got nothing but dreams

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm just young enough to still believe, still believe
But young enough not to know what to believe in
Young enough not to know what to believe in, yeah

[Chorus]
If I can live through this
If I can live through this
If I can live through this
I can do anything

If I can live through this
If I can live through this
If I can live through this
I can do anything

[Bridge 1]
Champion, champion
Champion, champion

[Verse 2]
I got rage every day, on the inside
The only thing I do is sit around and kill time
I'm trying to blow out the pilot light
I'm trying to blow out the light

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm just young enough to still believe, still believe
But young enough not to know what to believe in
Young enough not to know what to believe

[Chorus]
If I can live through this
If I can live through this
If I can live through this
I can do anything

If I can live through this
If I can live through this
If I can live through this
I can do anything

[Bridge 2]
Champion, champion
I can do anything
Champion, champion
And I can do anything

Champion, champion
And I can do anything
Champion, champion
I can do anything!

[Chorus]
If I can live through this
If I can live through this
If I can live through this
And I can do anything

If I can live through this
If I can live through this
If I can live through this
I can do anything

[Extended Chorus]
If I can live through this
If I can live through this
If I can live through this
If I can live through this, I can do anything

If I can live through this
If I can live through this
If I can live through this
If I can live through this

I can do anything
I can do anything
I can do anything
I can do anything!

[Outro]
Champion, champion
                        
                    |
