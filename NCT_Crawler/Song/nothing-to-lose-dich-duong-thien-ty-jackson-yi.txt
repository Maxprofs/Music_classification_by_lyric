                        Bài hát: Nothing To Lose - Dịch Dương Thiên Tỷ (Jackson Yi)

I know exactly what to do 
You make these dreams come true 
And you've been there through and through 
So that's why I'm sing to you like 

I won't I won't I won't stop now 
I know I know I want that crown 
I'm steady making these moves 
I'm steady making these moves 

I got nothing nothing nothing to lose 
I'm steady making these moves
I'm steady making these moves
I got nothing nothing nothing to lose 

My heart only beats for you 
I got a lot of things to prove Eh
I would travel to the moon 
If you be there with me too like 

I won't I won't I won't stop now 
I know I know I want that crown 
I'm steady making these moves 
I'm steady making these moves 

I got nothing nothing nothing to lose 
I'm steady making these moves 
I'm steady making these moves 
I got nothing nothing nothing to lose 

Shooting for the stars shooting for the stars 
We made it this far We made it this far 
I won't I won't I won't stop now 
I know I know I want that crown 

I'm steady making these moves 
I'm steady making these moves 
I got nothing nothing nothing to lose 

I'm steady making these moves 
I'm steady making these moves 
I got nothing nothing nothing to lose [X4]
