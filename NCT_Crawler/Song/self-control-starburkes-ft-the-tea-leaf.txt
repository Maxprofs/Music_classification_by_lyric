                        (Giancarlo Bigazzi, Raffael Riefoli, Steve Piccolo)

Oh the night is my world
City light painted girls
In the day nothing matters
It's the night time that flatters
In the night no control
Through the wall something breaking
Wearing white as you're walking
Down the street of my soul

You take myself you take my self control
You got me living only for the night
Before the morning comes
A story's told
You take myself you take my self control
Another night, another day goes by
I never stop myself to wonder why
You help me to forget to play my role
You take myself you take my self control

I, I live among the creatures of the night
I haven't got the will to try and fight
Against a new tomorrow
So I guess I'll just believe it
That tomorrow never comes

A safe night, I'm living in the forest of my dream
I know the night is not as it would seem
I must believe in something
So I'll make myself believe it
That this night will never go
Ohoho, ohoho,ohoho, ohoho Ohoho...

I haven't got the will to try and fight...
Against a new tomorrow
So I guess I'll just believe it
That tomorrow never knows

A safe night, I'm living in the forest of my dream
I know the night is not as it would seem
I must believe in something
So I'll make myself believe it
That this night will never go
Ohoho, ohoho, ohoho, ohoho Ohoho...

[Start fade out]

You take my self, you take my self control
[Repeated 4 times]

I'm living in the forest of my dream
I know the night is not as it would seem

You take my self, you take my self control
[Repeated 5 times & final fade out]
