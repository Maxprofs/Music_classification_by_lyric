[Lil' Wayne]
Hi, I’m Tune, the man on the moon
I live on the beach, get the sand out ya shoes
And all of that changed since I met you
So we can leave that old * in the restroom
Ok, I’m into you, like you never knew
I’m falling for you baby, I need a parachute
So wet, I need a wetsuit
You’re way too fly, I could be ya jet fuel
Now tell me what you like
I like what you tell me
And if you understand me, you can overwhelm me
It’s too late, it’s too late
Every finish line is the beginning of a new race
Young Money!

[Jennifer Lopez - Verse 1]

You got me and I could not defend her
I tried but I had to surrender
Your star got me under the spellbound
Left me no other choice but to get down
It's too late (x4)
You got it (x4)

[Hook]

When I look into your eyes it's over
You got me hooked with your love controller
I'm tripping and I can not get over
I'm feeling lucky like a four leaf clover
Cos i'm into you
I'm into you (x2)
Yeahhh
I'm into you (x3)
Yeahhh

[Jennifer Lopez - Verse 2]

Na na na na na na na na na yeah (x4)
Listen, i'm strong baby I bring the fight on

But all of that changed baby when I met you
It's too late (x4)
You got it (x4)

Na na na na na na na na na yeah (x4)

[Bridge]
I’m not burning and I’m feeling you boy
Get it on if you feeling my world now
I love the way that you moving
And I’m listening to how you grooving
So if you need me, just call on the cruise
