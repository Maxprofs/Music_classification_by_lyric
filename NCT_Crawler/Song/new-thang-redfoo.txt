                        Bài hát: New Thang - Redfoo

[Chorus]
Oh, the way that you pop, girl
Makes me go cray, show me whachya got, girl!
You could be my new thang
Oh, the way that you move
Makes me go cray, do ya luv that drop, girl?
You could be my new thang
Aha, uhuhu uhuhu
Aha, uhuhu uhuhu
Get saxy, girl, get saxy
Get saxy, girl, get saxy
Get saxy, girl, get saxy

[Verse]
I heard it's yo birthday
Grab a drink if ya thirsty
I can see that ya need an OG

That can do ya the beast and the worst way
Pop it like a go-go
Drop it like a low-low
What's that? It's a go-pro?
So I can watch that back, HD- Slo-mo

[Pre-Chorus] 
I don't care if it's the first beat
I'll take ya back to my place
We can skip first base
Cuz a playa like me 
Tryna slide into home plate
Clap clap, make it clap
Lights on, lights off
Make it clap
Yeah
Make it clap 
My name ain't Santa 
But she sittin' on my lap

[Verse]
I heard that ya single
Now ya talkin' my lingo
Let's play casino
Bring four friends plus you
Bingo! Ye ain't nuttin' but a flirt
The way ya bouncin' in that shirt
It's amaxin' how ya drop it
Pick it up and still make it work

[Pre-Chorus]
Y o body lethal, I might LA freak ya
Goddamit, that booty fast
Sittin' high up on yo back
What the f&*() did they feed ya?
Clap clap, make it clap
Lights on, lights off
Make it clap
Yeah
Make it clap 
My name ain't Apple
But they call me the Mac
                        
                    |
