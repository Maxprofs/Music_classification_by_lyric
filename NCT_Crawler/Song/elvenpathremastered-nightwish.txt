                        The sheltering shade of the forest
 Calling, calming silence
 Accompanied only be the full moon
 The howling of a night wolf
 And the path under my bare feet
 The elvenpath

 Hearing music from the deepest forest
 Songs as a seduction of sirens
 The elf-folk is calling me
 Tapio, Bearking, Ruler of the forest
 Mielikki, Bluecloak, Healer of the I'll and sad
 Open the gate and let me follow the uncarven path

 The way to the lands
 Where as a hero I stand
 The path where Beauty met the Beast
 Elvenpath
 Itґs the honesty of these worlds
 Ruled by magic and mighty swords
 That makes my soul long for the past
 Elvenpath

 The moonwitch took me to a ride on a broomstick
 Introduced me to her old friend Home Gnome
 Told me to keep the sauna warm for him
 At the grove I met rest-the folk of my fantasies
 Bilbo, Sparhawk, goblins and pixies,
 Snowman, Willow, trolls and the seven dwarfs
 The path goes forever on

 The way to the lands
 Where as a hero I stand
 The path where Beauty met the Beast
 Elvenpath
 Itґs the honesty of these worlds
 Ruled by magic and mighty swords
 That makes my soul long for the past
 Elvenpath

 Long ago in the early years of the second age
 Great elven smith forged the rings of power

 As I return to my room
 And as sleep takes me by my hand
 Madrigals from the woods
 Carry me to neverland
 In this spellbound night
 The worldґs an elvish sight
 In this spellbound night
 The worlds an elvish sight

 But then the dark lord learnedthe craft
 Of ring making and made the master ring
                        
                    |
