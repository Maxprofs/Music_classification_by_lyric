                        Bài hát: My Dark Side (Glee Cast Version) - Glee Cast

[Blaine:]
Uh-ooh
Uh-oh oh, oh,
There's a place that I know
It's not pretty there and few have ever gone
If I show it to you now
Will it make you run away
Will you stay
Even if it hurts
Even if I try to push you out
Will you return?
And remind me who I really am
Please remind me who I really am

[Blaine with The Warblers:]
Everybody's got a dark side
Do you love me?
Can you love mine?
Nobody's a picture perfect
But we're worth it
You know that we're worth it

[Blaine:]
Will you love me?
Even with my dark side?

[Blaine with The Warblers:]
Like a diamond
From black dust
It's hard to know
What can become
If you give up
So don't give up on me
Please remind me who I really am, yeah!
Everybody's got a dark side
Do you love me?
Can you love mine?
Nobody's a picture perfect
But we're worth it
You know that we're worth it

[Blaine:]
Will you love me?
Even with my dark side?

[Blaine with The Warblers:]
Don't run away
Don't run away ([The Warblers:] Don't run away)

[Blaine:]
Just tell me that you will stay ([The Warblers:] Just tell me that you will stay)
Promise me you will stay ([The Warblers:] Promise me you will stay)

[Blaine with The Warblers:]
Don't run away
Don't run away
Just promise me you will stay ([The Warblers:] Just promise me you will stay)
Promise me you will stay ([The Warblers:] Promise me you will stay)

[Blaine:]
Will you love me, with my dark side? Ohh!

[Blaine with The Warblers:]
Everybody's got a dark side
Do you love me?
Can you love mine?
Nobody's a picture perfect
But we're worth it
You know that we're worth it

[Blaine:]
Will you love me?
Even with my dark side?
Don't run away
Don't run away
                        
                    |
