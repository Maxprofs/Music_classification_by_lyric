                        I can't win, I can't reign
I will never win this game
Without you, without you

I am lost, I am vain,
I will never be the same
Without you, without you

I won't run, I won't fly
I will never make it by
Without you, without you

I can't rest, I can't fight
All I need is you and I,
Without you, without.... You!

Oh oh oh
You you you
Without
You you you
Without you..

Can't erase, so I'll take blame
But I can't accept that we were strange
Without you, without you

I can't quit now, this can't be right
I can't take one more sleepless night
Without you, without you

I won't soar, I won't climb
If you're not here I'm paralyzed without you, without you

I can't look, I'm so blind
Lost my heart, I lost my mind without you without... You!

Oh oh oh
You you you
Without
You you you
Without you..

I am lost, I am vain,
I will never be the same
Without you, without you, WITHOUT YOU
