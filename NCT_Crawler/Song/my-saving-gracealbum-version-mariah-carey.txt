 I've Still Got A Lot To Learn
 But, At Least I Know Where I Can Turn
 When I'm In My Times Of Need
 Just As Long
 (As I Know All Things Are Possible)
 Just As Long As I Believe

 Verse 1
 I've Loved A Lot, Hurt A Lot
 Been Burned A Lot In My Life And Times
 Spent Precious Years Wrapped Up In Fear
 With No End In Sight
 Until My Saving Grace Shined On Me
 Until My Saving Grace Set Me Free

 Chorus 1
 Giving Me Peace
 Giving Me Strength When I'd
 Almost Lost It All
 Catching My Every Fall
 I Still Exist Because You Keep Me Safe
 I Found My Saving Grace Within You

 Verse 2
 Yes, I've Been Bruised
 Grew Up Confused
 Been Destitute
 I've Seen Life From Many Sides
 Been Stigmatized
 Been Black And White
 Felt Inferior Inside
 Until My Saving Grace Shined On Me
 Until My Saving Grace Set Me Free

 Chorus 2
 Giving Me Peace
 Giving Me Strength When I'd
 Almost Lost It All
 Catching My Every Fall
 I Still Exist Because You Kept Me Safe
 I Found My Saving Grace Within You

 Bridge
 And The Bountiful Things That You Do
 Lord Thank You
 For Delivering Me

 Chorus
 And Giving me Peace
 Giving Me Strength
 Giving Me Hope When I'd
 Almost Lost It All
 Catching My Every Fall
 I Still Exist Because You Keep Me Safe
 Always My Saving Grace
 Pulls Me Through
 I Found My Saving Grace Within You

 Ending
 (Yes You Are ? You're My Every, Everything)
 Within You -------
 (Only, Only You)
 Yes Lord
 (Only You)
 My Saving Grace Lord Is You
