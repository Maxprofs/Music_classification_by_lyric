                        This is a man's world, this is a man's world
 But it wouldn't be nothing, nothing without a woman or a girl You see, man made the cars to take us over the road
 Man made the train to carry the heavy load
 Man made electric light to take us out of the dark
 Man made the boat for the water, like Noah made the ark This is a man's, man's, man's world
 But it wouldn't be nothing, nothing without a woman or a girl Man thinks about our little bitty baby girls and our baby boys
 Man made them happy, 'cause man made them toys
 And after man make everything, everything he can
 You know that man makes money, to buy from other man This is a man's world
 But it wouldn't be nothing, nothing, not one little thing, without a woman or a girl
 He's lost in the wilderness
 He's lost in bitterness, he's lost lost
                        
                    |
