sher (yeah man) 
So we back in the club 
Get that bodies rockin from side to side (side to side) 
Thank God the week is done 
I feel like a zombie gone back to life (back to life) 
Hands up, and suddenly we all got our hands up 
No control of my body 
Ain’t I seen you before? 
I think I remember those eyes, eyes, eyes, eyes 
Cause baby tonight, the DJ got us falling in love again 
Yeah, baby tonight, the DJ got us falling in love again 
So dance, dance, like it’s the last, last night of your life, life 
Gonna get you right 
Cause baby tonight, the DJ got us falling in love again 
Keep downing drinks like this 
Not tomorrow that just right now, now, now, now, now, now 
Gonna set the roof on fire 
Gonna burn this * down, down, down, down, down, down 
Hands up, when the music drops 
We both put our hands up 
Put your hands on my body 
Swear I seen you before 
I think I remember those eyes, eyes, eyes, eyes 
Cause baby tonight, the DJ got us falling in love again 
Yeah, baby tonight, the DJ got us falling in love again 
So dance, dance, like it’s the last, last night of your life, life 
Gonna get you right 
Cause baby tonight, the DJ got us falling in love again

In the cover of the music 
Get naked baby 
I’m sorry chica 
Better holla at Tyrone 
Let him know how I jump through your foot loop 
Scolla chico two can 
We’re from the blocka blocka o polaca 
Were the boys get loose like wacka flacka 
Oh no man, it’s global 
Was’ up 
Colale flacka 
I wanna be your giant, no not your dada 
Dale abre ai 
Papa Nicholas baby 
Let me see 
Yo soi un Jaunito 
Que stato taito 
Yo freco, no OK 

Cause baby tonight, the DJ got us falling in love again 
Yeah, baby tonight, the DJ got us falling in love again 
So dance, dance, like it’s the last, last night of your life, life 
Gonna get you right 
Cause baby tonight, the DJ got us falling in love again 
Yeah, baby tonight, the DJ got us falling in love again 
So dance, dance, like it’s the last, last night of your life, life 
Gonna get you right 
Cause baby tonight, the DJ got us falling in love again 
Yeah, thank you DJ
