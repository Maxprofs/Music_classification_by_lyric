 Saturday night is the loneliest night in the week
 'cause that's the night that my sweetie and I
 Used to dance cheek to cheek
 I don't mind sunday night at all
 'cause that's the night friends come to call
 And monday to friday go fast
 And another week is past

 But saturday night is the loneliest night in the week
 I sing the song that I sang for the memories I usually seek
 Until I hear you at the door
 Until you're in my arms once more
 Saturday night is the loneliest night in the week

 Mmmm... Saturday night is the loneliest night in the week
 I sing the song that I sang for the memories I usually seek
 Until I hear you at the door
 Until you're in my arms once more
 Saturday night is the loneliest night in the week

 Until I hear you at the door
 Until you're in my arms once more
 Saturday night is the loneliest night in the week
