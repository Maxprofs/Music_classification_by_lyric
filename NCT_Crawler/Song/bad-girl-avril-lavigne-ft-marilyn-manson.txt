                        Bài hát: Bad Girl - Avril Lavigne, Marilyn Manson


Hey, hey
I'll let you walk all over me, me
You know that I’m a little tease, tease
But I wanna play there please, please

You know you know you know I’m crazy
I just wanna be your baby
You can *** me, you can play me
You can love and you can hate me

Miss me, miss me, now you wanna kiss me

[Chorus]
Choke me because I said so
Stroke me and feed my ego
I’ve been a bad girl, don’t you know?
(Don’t tell me what to do)
Come get it now or never
I’ll let you do whatever
I’ll be your bad girl, here we go
(1-2-3-4)

Miss me, miss me, now you wanna kiss me

(You're a bad girl)

Baby,
You know I want a little taste, taste
So let me take you all the way, way
You know you’ll never be the same, same

(You ***in' bad girl!)

One night
You won’t forget the rest of your life
So come on over to the wild side
Buckle up and, baby, hold on tight

Miss me, miss me, now you wanna kiss me
We both know that you love me 'cause I'm so bad!

[Chorus]
Choke me because I said so
Stroke me and feed my ego
I’ve been a bad girl, don’t you know?
(Don’t tell me what to do)
Come get it now or never
I’ll let you do whatever
I’ll be your bad girl, here we go
(1-2-3-4)

I’ve been a bad girl [7x]
I’ve got your bad girl

[Chorus]
Choke me because I said so
Stroke me and feed my ego
I’ve been a bad girl, don’t you know?
(Don’t tell me what to do)
Come get it now or never
I’ll let you do whatever
I’ll be your bad girl, here we go
(1-2-3-4)

Bad bad bad girl
                        
                    |
