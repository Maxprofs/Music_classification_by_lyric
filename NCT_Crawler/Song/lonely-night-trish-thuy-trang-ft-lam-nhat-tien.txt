                        Lonely Night

Sometimes I feel so lost, so lonely
I think of you, you're not around me
Sometimes I feel you're here, beside me
But all I see, long lonely nights for you & for me

Chorus:

Another lonely night just passing through
Alone by the stars & moon
Why can't you be the one, the one for me
A love not meant to be

Oh how I want to say "I love you"
And hold you close
I'll never let you go
I miss the times we had together
The radio playing our songs for you & for me

Time after time I run to places, that we had been.
Brings back the memories.
Night after night would last forever.
Without you here there’s so much love I have to give you.

Repeat Chorus
Lonely nights...
Lonely nights...
                        
                    |
