Chuh eum aen mohl laht jee chin goo lah seng gahk het jee

I only wanted someone beside me,
Someone to talk to someone to guide me

Weh nah mahn hohn jah ee luh neun guhl kkah

I'm being faced with denial
I know i've been cheated and lied to
It's okay, though i'm strong enough
I know that i'll pull through
And i'm not gonna sit here thinkin'
Who's right or wrong
Now,i'm better than that
I've learned to fight
I'm gonna move on.

Yo, i'm tired of this, can't take it.
I'm sick of your lies, your fakeness.
After all you've done you'd think i'd fall.
But you know what? I'll pull through it all.
See i learn from my mistakes.
Took a while to realize you was a fake.
But now i'm good, i'm through with you.
Put my life back in the right place.
Should've known you would've used me.
Should've known never to mess with fate.
But now it's cool, it's over now.
And i ain't gonna hate just know.


I only wanted someone to talk to.
Sorry,i thought i'd found it in you.
Welcome to ***

*uh dduhk ha myun nuh leul ee hae hahl soo eet nah
Geuh leh doh joh aht dun sah ee yut neun deh
Nan ee jen ee jjeum ae suh kkeut neh goh ship puh
Duh mee wuh jee gee jun ae dah gah oh jee mah

Rap)
But now i'm faced with denial
Know i've been cheated
And lied to it's okay, though,
I'm strong enough.
I know that i'll pull through.
And i'm not gonna sit here thinkin'
Who's right or wrong.
Now,i'm better than that,
I've learned to fight.
I'm gonna move on. And yeah,
I admit that i was blind.
Deceived by your stupid disguise.
But i got peace within kuz
I know that through this.
Some good will arise.
It's called strength over struggle.
It's what's keeping me here.
So let's get one thing straight
I'm a fighter! So hear me loud and clear.
