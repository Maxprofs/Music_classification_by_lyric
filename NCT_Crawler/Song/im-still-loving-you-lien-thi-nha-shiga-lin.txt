                        Bài hát: I'm Still Loving You - Shiga Lin (Liên Thi Nhã)

When i close my eyes i think of you
And the times we’ve had been through
Even though we’re far apart right now

I remember back when you were here with me
How you’ve make my world complete
But now i’m left alone

We talked about, love and hope
Wishing we could start a life our own
I wish that i could live without you

Why did you tear my heart apart, you said you’ll love me from the start
All those painful things you’ve put me through but, i’m still loving you
I’ve tried to give my best to you, i don’t deserve the things you do
Everything has gone to memories, i just wish i knew the truth, behind the lies

Why did you tear my heart apart, you said you’ll love me from the start
All those painful things you’ve put me through but, i’m still loving you
I’ve tried to give my best to you, i don’t deserve the things you do
Everything has gone to memories, i just wish i knew the truth, behind the lies
