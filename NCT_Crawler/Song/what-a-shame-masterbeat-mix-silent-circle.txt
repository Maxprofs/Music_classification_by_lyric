                        Bài hát: What A Shame (Masterbeat Mix) - Silent Circle

You are my everything
I cannot forget
You are all in my life
I'm feeling so sad

You make me feel myself
It's more than a dream
But since you broke my heart
I know what I've been

What a shame
Don't tell me it's just a game
I never can forget your eyes
I feel so lonely
I cannot live without you
What a shame

(What a shame)
(Just a game)
(Your blue eyes)

Why don't you show me the way
The way to your heart
'Cause I feel deep inside
That we'll never part

(What a shame)
Don't tell me it's just a game
(Just a game)
I never can forget your eyes
(Your blue eyes)
I feel so lonely
I cannot live without you

Since you've gone
I long for your love
Since you've gone
I cry for you
When I wish
You come back to me
Till eternity

Don't tell me it's just a game
(Just a game)
I never can forget your eyes
(Your blue eyes)
I feel so lonely
I cannot live without you
                        
                    |
