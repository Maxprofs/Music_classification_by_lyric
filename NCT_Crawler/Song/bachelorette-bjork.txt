 bachelorette

 bjork

I am a fountain of blood
In the shape of a girl
You are the bird on the brim
Hypno tised by the Whirl

Drink me make me feel real
Wet your beak in the stream
Game we are playing is the life
Love is to way dream

Leave me now,return tonight
Tide will show you the way
If you forget my name
You will go as tray
Like a killer whale
Trapped in a bay

I am a path of cinders
Burning under your feet
You are the one who walks me
I am your one way street

I am a whisper in water
Secret for you to hear
You are the one who grows distant
When I back on you near

Leave me now,return tonight
The tide will show you the way
If you forget my name
You will go as tray
Like a killer whale
Trapped in a bay

I am a tree that grows hearts
One for each that you take
You are the in truder hand
I am the branch that you break

Hum da

Un.....
