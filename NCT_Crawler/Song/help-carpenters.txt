                        When I was younger, so much

 Younger than today

 I never needed anybody's help

 In any way

 But now these days are gone

 I'm not so self assure

 Now I find I've changed my mind

 I've opened up the door

 (*) Help me if you can I'm feeling down

 And if you do appreciate you being round

 Help me get my feet back on the ground

 Won't you please, please help me

 Please help me

 And now my life has changed in

 Oh! So many ways

 My independence seems to vanish

 In the haze

 And every now and then

 I feel so insecure

 I know that I need you like

 I've never done before

 Repeat (*)

 Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah!

 Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah!

 Repeat (*)
                        
                    |
