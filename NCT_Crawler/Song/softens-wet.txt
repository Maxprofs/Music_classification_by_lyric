                        Bài hát: Softens - Wet

If you're needing something
You're looking for comfort
Something don't stable, I hope I'll be able
If you've lost your way
You don't know your place
The sun hits the table
At a beautiful angle

[Pre-Chorus]
To light up your life
And you'll need it most in the dark in the dead of the night
Light up your life
And you'll need it most in the dark in the dead of the night

[Chorus]
Where beauty softens grief
You'll go so low you're beneath yourself
Where beauty softens grief
You'll go so low you're beneath the ground
You used to walk on me

[Verse 2]
When you're needing comfort 'cause you've lost your love
Lay your head on the table, in hands of a stranger
If you're needing someone 'cause you've lost your love
Something stable, I hope I'll be able
[Pre-Chorus]
To light up your life
And you'll need it most in the dark in the dead of the night
Light up your life
And you'll need it most in the dark in the dead of the night

[Chorus]
Where beauty softens grief
You'll go so low you're beneath yourself
Where beauty softens grief
You'll go so low you're beneath the ground
Where beauty softens grief
You'll go so low you're beneath the ground
Where beauty softens grief
You'll go so low you're beneath the ground

[Bridge]
Lay me, lay me down
Let my feet sink in the ground
Let me be close to the one that I have lost
That I have lost

[Chorus]
Where beauty softens grief
You'll go so low you're beneath yourself
Where beauty softens grief
You'll go so low you're beneath the ground
Where beauty softens grief
You'll go so low you're beneath yourself
And be the help on the ground, where beauty-
You're beneath the ground
You used to walk on me

[Outro]
Why don't you light? You need the hope
Why don't you light the darkest night?
Why don't come night? You need it most
Why don't you light the darkest night?

Where beauty softens grief
Where beauty softens grief
Where beauty softens grief
                        
                    |
