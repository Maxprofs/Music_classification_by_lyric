                        Bài hát: Livin' The Life (Afrojack Remix) - Ananya Birla

La la, la la, lala...
Don't you want
Don't you twice

You even gonna that bad
I know know
See the fires in the eyes
You wanna burn me this time
I know know
Let's made get serious
I wanna get whole sum to you know
you making me furious, you just want to keep in the door
I cheer up with you baby
but you dont want to love me.
I cheer up with you baby
but you think it's funny

I dont wanna
I dont wanna
pain
pain
I dont wanna
I dont wanna
pain
pain
i just wanna be painless

Livin' The Life
Livin' The Life.

La La, La La

People play with my heart
I can take it no more
No No
Be a man, Be prepare
or gonna be fly in solo
You made me serious
I wanna get whole sum to you know
you making me furious
you just want me keep in the door
I cheer up with you baby
but you dont want to love me.
I cheer up with you baby
but you think it's funny
I dont wanna
I dont wanna
pain
pain
I dont wanna
I dont wanna
pain
pain
i just wanna be painless
