[00:-2.00]Daughtry - What Have We Become
[00:-1.00]

All those years,
One day changes everything and
Caught in your life and the passion fades away
Saving for something
That you'll never see in your days
Shutting out everything that you need

Looking through distorted eyes
Beautiful disaster
Adding up a million lies
So much for ever after

Building up your wall from
Everything you wanted
Fit the pieces into holes we used to crawl away
Giving in or leave me too slow
Now we have what we have become

All the tears,
We'd never thought you'd see the day when
The trappings of your life would seem to disappear
Going through the vacancy that you leave behind
Not what you have promised,
Not what you believed
Looking through distorted eyes
Beautiful disaster
Adding up a million lies
So much for ever after

Building up your wall from
Everything you wanted
Fit the pieces into holes we used to crawl away
Finding out the truth when nothing really matters
Chase the light that's blinding even as you crawl away
Giving in or leave me too slow
Now we have what we have become

Another advice to ease your pain
Now you know it's not the way out
Now you know it's not the way out

Not the way out

Building up your wall from
Everything you wanted
Fit the pieces into holes we used to crawl away
Finding out the truth, when nothing really matters
Chase the light that's blinding even as you crawl away
Giving in or leave me too slow
Now we have what we have become
Giving in or leave me to know
Now we have what we have become
