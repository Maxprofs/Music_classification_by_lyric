Ooh you're a holiday , such a holiday
Ooh you're a holiday , such a holiday

Its something I thinks worthwhile
If the puppet makes you smile
If not then you're throwing stones
Throwing stones, throwing stones

Ooh it's a funny game
Don't believe that it's all the same
Cant think what Ive just said
Put the soft pillow on my head

Millions of eys can see
Yet why am I so blind
When the someone else is me
Its unkind, it's unkind

De de de de de de de de de de de de de
De de de de de de de de de de de de de

Yet millions of eyes can see
Yet why am I so blind
When the someone else is me
Its unkind, it's unkind

Ooh you're a holiday , evry day , such a holiday
Now it's my turn to say , and I say you're a holiday
Its something I thinks worthwhile
If the puppet makes you smile
If not then you're throwing stones
Throwing stones , throwing stones
