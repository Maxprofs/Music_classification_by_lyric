                        Dance into my life, only for a while
 Whirl me round and round
 Dance me like an Angel child He's passing through my world
 He doesn't even know
 Time's not on my side
 No word or goodbye I'll go So dance on
 Right now I want to dance on
 Until the moment's over
 And I'll be going home
 I'll be going home Just dance on
 Right now I want to dance on
 I can't let him notice the
 Tears in my eyes
 In my eyes, in my eyes Dance into my life
 Hold the moment fast
 Make believe in us
 Nothing real in life can last Dance within my life
 Dance me to the door
 I can't see the time
 But the time has come for sure, for sure So dance on
 Right now I want to dance on
 Until the moment's over
 And I'll be going home
 I'll be going home Just dance on
 Right now I want to dance on
 I can't let him notice the
 Tears in my eyes
 In my eyes, in my eyes Dance with me, dance with me
 Won't you dance with me
 Dance with me, dance with me
 Won't you dance with me So dance on
 Right now I want to dance on
 Until the moment's over
 And I'll be going home
 I'll be going home So dance on
 Right now I want to dance on
 Until the moment's over
 And I'll be going home
 I'll be going home So dance on
 Right now I want to dance on
 Until the moment's over
 And I'll be going home
 I'll be going home
