Don't burry me
Don't lay me down
Don't say it's over
Cause that would send me under
Underneath the ground
Don't say those words
I wanna live and your words can murder
Only you can send me under, under, under

I die every time you walk away
Stay don't leave me alone with me
I'm afraid

Of the darkness
Of the voices
Saying nothing's going to be ok
Anyway

I feel it in my heart
Soul, mind that I’m losing
You, me
You're abusing every reason
I have left to live

Don't burry me
Don't lay me down
Don't say it's over
Cause that would send me under
Underneath the ground
Don't say those words
I wanna live and your words can murder
Only you can send me under, under, under

Lost trust 21 grams of soul
All the sanity I ever owned
But I’m still breathing
Through the thunder
And the fire and the madness
Just to let me shoot you down again

But I’m still breathing

I feel it in my veins, skin, bones
That I’m losing you, me
You're confusing
Every reason I have left to live

Don't burry me
Don't lay me down
Don't say it's over
Cause that would send me under
Underneath the ground
Don't say those words
I wanna live and your words can murder
Only you can send me under, under, under

Chasing you but you don't look turn
Words I through that I can't take back
Reaching out but I can't hold on to you
Chasing you but you don't look turn
Words I through that I can't take back
Reaching out but I can't hold on to you

Don't burry me
Don't lay me down
Don't say it's over
Cause that would send me under
Underneath the ground
Don't say those words
I wanna live and your words can murder
Only you can send me under, under, under
                        
                    |
