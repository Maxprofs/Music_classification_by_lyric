                        It's undeniable 
That we should be together 
It's unbelievable 
How I used to say that I'd fall never 
The basis you need to know 
If you don't know just how I feel 
Then let me show you now 
That I'm for real 
If all things in time 
Time will reveal 
Yeah 

One, you're like a dream come true 
Two, just wanna be with you 
Three, girl it's plain to see 
That you're the only one for me 
Four, repeat steps one through three 
Five, make you fall in love with me 
If ever I believe my work is done 
Then I start back at one 

So incredible 
The way things work themselves out 
And all emotional, once you know what it's all about babe 
And undesirable 
For us to be apart 
Never would have made it very far 
Cause you know that you've got the keys to my heart 
Cause 

One, you're like a dream come true 
Two, just wanna be with you 
Three, girl it's plain to see 
That you're the only one for me 
Four, repeat steps one through three 
Five, make you fall in love with me 
If ever I believe my work is done 
Then i start back at one 

Say farewell to the dark night 
I see the coming of the sun 
I feel like a little child 
Whose life has just begun 
You came and breathed new life 
Into this lonely heart of mine 
You threw out the life line 
Just in the nick of time 

One, you're like a dream come true 
Two, just wanna be with you 
Three, girl it's plain to see 
That you're the only one for me 
Four, repeat steps one through three 
Five, make you fall in love with me 
If ever i believe my work is done 
Then I start back at one
                        
                    |
