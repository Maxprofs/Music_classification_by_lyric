                        Bài hát: Tôi Là Người Việt Nam - Ánh Minh

When I was young, I thought I knew it all
My mom would tell me the stories of our home
The fields of rice, the lullabies she was singing to me

It’s been so long ago
Oh ouh oh It seems so far away
And now I realize I’ve never seen you before

I long to know about my beginning
The meaning of my name, my golden skin
Little towns, sacred temples where my ancestors watch over me

It’s been so long ago
Oh ouh oh It seems so far away
But no matter where I go, where I was born
I’ll always know a part of you is deep in my heart

Vietnam your beauty lies within
Sweetest dreams of whispering winds
I hear your voice inside of me
Telling me who I am, who I am

Vietnam your beauty resonates
Water flows through your thousand lakes
One day I will find my way
To where it all began

And say “Tôi là người Việt Nam”

Your beauty lies within
Your beauty resonates

Vietnam deep in my heart
Từ trong tim tôi mãi là người Việt Nam
                        
                    |
