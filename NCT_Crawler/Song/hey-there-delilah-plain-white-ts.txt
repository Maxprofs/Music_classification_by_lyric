                        Nhung,I love U

Hey there delilah
Whats it like in new york city
Im a thousand miles away
But girl tonight you look so pretty
Yes you do
Time square cant shine as bright as you
I swear its true
Hey there delilah
Dont you worry about the distance
Im right there if you get lonely
Give this song another listen
Close your eyes
Listen to my voice its my disguise
Im by your side
Oh its what you do to me
Oh its what you do to me
Oh its what you do to me
Oh its what you do to me
What you do to me
Hey there delilah
I know times are gettin hard
But just believe me girl
Someday ill pay the bills with this guitar
We'll have it good
We'll have the life we knew we would
My word is good
Hey there delilah
Ive got so much left to say
If every simple song i wrote to you
Would take your breath away
Id write it all
Even more in love with me youd fall
We'd have it all
Oh its what you do to me
Oh its what you do to me
Oh its what you do to me
Oh its what you do to me
A thousand miles seems pretty far
But they've got planes and trains and cars
Id walk to you if i had no other way
Our friends would all make fun of us
And we'll just laugh along because we know
That none of them have felt this way
Delilah i can promise you
That by the time that we get through
The world will never ever be the same
And youre to blame
Hey there delilah
You be good and dont you miss me
Two more years and youll be done with school
[And ill be makin history like i do
You know its all because of you
We can do whatever we want to
Hey there delilah heres to you
This ones for you
Oh its what you do to me
Oh its what you do to me
Oh its what you do to me
Oh its what you do to me
What you do to me
