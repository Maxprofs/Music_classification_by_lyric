 Ag breacadh an lae do chumar ag sil
 Aoibhneas an tsaoil amach romhainn
 Clocha draochta chomh geal lenr sile
 Casn ag glioscarnach dinn
 Suaimhneas na coillte is ceol inr gcroithe
 Macalla fuaim an tsruthin
 Duilleoga fmhar mar ghuth ar an ngaoth
 S ndr is cis lenr ngr
 A'Taisteal sa choill seo ar fn is ar fuaidreamh
 Ralta geala eolais ag lonradh don are
 A'Taisteal sa choill seo ar fn is ar fuaidreamh
 Clocha bna ag lasadh are sl
 Anois t ralta a'rince sa spir
 Is an saol ina gholadh go smh
 Aislingi ille I ngairdn mo rn
 Brionglid thart orainn ar snmh
 Sile sor lasta le solas
 Sile faoi gheasa na rn
 Taibhreamh ar sheoda an ghairdn
 Iontais nach sceithfear go buan
 A'Taisteal sa choill seo ar fn is ar fuaidreamh
 Ralta geala eolais ag louradh don are
 A'Taisteal sa choill seo ar fn is ar fuaidreamh
 Clocha bna ag lasadh are sl
 Translated:
 The light of the sun took us strolling
 With the treasures of the world lying ahead,
 Magic stones as bright as our eyes
 Lighting a path before us
 The peace of the woods was music to our hearts
 Echoing the sound of the streams,
 Autumn leaves - the voice on the wind
 As nature is the source of our love
 Now the stones are dancing in the sky
 While the world is quietly sleeping,
 Lovely visions in the secret garden,
 Of dreams floating all around us
 Traveling in this forest like a lost soul
 Bright stars of knowledge shining for the king
 Traveling in this forest like a lost soul
 Bright stones lighting our way
 Eyes ever shining with light
 Eyes under a secret spell
 Dreaming of the jewels in the garden
 Of wonders that will never be revealed
