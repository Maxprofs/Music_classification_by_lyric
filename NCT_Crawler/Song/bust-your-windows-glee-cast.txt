                        Bài hát: Bust Your Windows - Glee Cast

I bust the windows out your car
And though it didn’t mend my broken heart
Ill probably always have these ugly scars
but right now I don’t care about that part.
I bust the windows out your car
After I saw you looking right at her
I didn’t wanna but I took my turn
I’m glad I did it cuz you had to learn

I must admit it helped a little bit
To think of how you'd feel when you saw it
I didn’t know that I had that much strength
But I’m glad you see what happens when
You see you cant just play with peoples feelings
Tell them you love them and don’t mean it
you’ll probably say that it was juvenile
But I think that I deserve to smile ha, ha, ha, ha, ha

I bust the windows out ya car
You know I did it cuz I left my mark
Wrote my initials with the crowbar
And then I drove off into the dark

I bust the windows out ya car ha,
you should feel lucky that was all I did
After 5 whole years of this bull *
Gave you all of me and you played with it

I must admit it helped a little bit
To think of how you'd feel when you saw it
I didn’t know that I had that much strength
But I’m glad you see what happens when
You see you cant just play with peoples feelings
Tell them you love them but don’t mean it
You probably say that it was juvenile
But I think that I deserve to smile
Bust them windows out yo car
But it don’t come back to my broken heart
You could neva feel I how I felt that day
Until it happens baby you don’t know pain
Ooh Yeah I did it (yeah I did it)
You should know it (you should kno it)
I ain’t sorry (I ain’t sorry)
You deserved it (you deserved it)
After what you did to me (after what you did)
You deserve it (you deserve it)
I ain’t sorry no no ohhh(I aint sorry)
You broke my heart so I broke you car
You caused me pain (you caused me pain)
(So I did the same)
Even though what you did to me was much worse
I had to do something to make you hurt
Oh but why am I still crying
Why am I the one who’s still crying
Oh oh really hurt me baby
really,really hurt me baby

Hey hey hey hey hey
Now watch me you
Now watch me
Oooh I bust the windows out your car.
