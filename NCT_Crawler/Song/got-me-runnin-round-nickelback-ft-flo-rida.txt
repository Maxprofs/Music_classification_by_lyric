                        Yeah the lady and me both agree some days we just don't get along
 But the whiskey and me both agree maybe we're just better off
 Well the preacher believes that I'll meet all these demons hanging on
 But we both know if they don't, I'll get lonely, need a few to tag along Hanging here by a thread
 Hear a voice inside my head Lie me beside you every night
 And dread the day you might be gone
 She said "In case you hadn't noticed that
 Played second fiddle to the bottle for a little too long (no)
 And I ain't about to anymore" Now the wagon I'm in's paper thin
 I think one wheel's coming off
 Hey sister sin with that grin, where you been?
 So kind of you to help me off Hanging here by a thread
 Hear a voice inside my head Lie me beside you every night
 And dread the day you might be gone
 She said "In case you hadn't noticed that
 Played second fiddle to the bottle for a little too long (no)
 And I ain't about to anymore" Fall from grace, kingdom come
 Lying face down in the mud
 Please don't hate, love don't judge
 For I know not just what I've done Fall from grace, kingdom come
 Lying face down in the mud
 Please don't hate, love don't judge
 For I know not just what I've done Lying face down in the mud
 For I know not just what I've done
 For I know not just what I've done Lie me beside you every night
 And dread the day you might be gone
 She said "In case you hadn't noticed that
 Played second fiddle to the bottle for a little too long (no)
 And I ain't about to anymore" Lie me beside you every night
 And dread the day you might be gone
 She said "In case you hadn't noticed that
 Played second fiddle to the bottle for a little too long (no)
 And I ain't about to anymore"
