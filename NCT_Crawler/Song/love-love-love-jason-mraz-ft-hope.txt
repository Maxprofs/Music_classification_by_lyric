                        Love, Love, Love, Love, Love
Giving me
Love, Love, Love
More than I ever need
Love, you're so distracting
Am I overreacting, For feeling this way
And ever, since I met ya, I can't keep my attention
And you are to blame

You're love's a permanent distraction,
A perfect interaction
A feeling so extreme
I lost my appetite to eat, and I barely get to sleep
Cause you're even in my dreams
And I thought that I was strong but I knew that all along,
This was out of my control
So I fell into your hands, and I don't know where we'll land,
I'm just going with the flow
Love, Love, Love, Love, Love



Somedays, I want to run away
This feels so perfect, it's breaking my heart
Yeah we could, we could stay here happy
Or after summer, be two worlds apartYou're love's a permanent distraction,
A perfect interaction
A feeling so extreme
I lost my appetite to eat, and I barely get to sleep
Cause you're even in my dreams
And I thought that I was strong but I knew that all along,
This was out of my control
So I fell into your hands, and I don't know where we'll land,
I'm just going with the flow
Giving me, Love Love Love, Love Love

More than I ever need
Giving me Love Love Love
You're Love, Is coming like a freight train
Ain't nothing gonna stop it,
It's heading for my heart,
You're Love, is bigger than a rain cloud
It covered up my whole skies
It's filling up my heart,
My heart with
Love, Love, Love, Love, Love
More than I ever need
Giving me
Love, Love, Love

You're love's a permanent distraction,
A perfect interaction
A feeling so extreme
I lost my appetite to eat, and I barely get to sleep
Cause you're even in my dreams
And I thought that I was strong but I knew that all along,
This was out of my control
So I fell into your hands, and I don't know where we'll land,
I'm just going with the flow Giving me, Love Love Love, Love Love
More than I ever need
