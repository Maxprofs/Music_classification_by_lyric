                        Bài hát: The Phantom Of The Opera - Original London Cast

[Famale:]
In sleep he sang to me
In dreams he came
That voice which calls to me
And speaks my name
And do I dream again
For now I find
The Phantom of the opera is there
Inside my mind

[Male:]
Sing once again with me
Our strange duet
My power over you
Grows stronger yet
And though you turn from me
To glance behind
The Phantom of the opera is there
Inside your mind

[Famale:]
Those who have seen your face
Draw back in fear
I am the mask you wear

[Male:]
It's me they hear

[Both:]
My/your spirit and your/my voice
In one combined
The phantom of the opera is there
Inside your/my mind

He's there the Phantom of the opera
Beware the Phantom of the opera

[Male:]
In all your phantasies
You always knew
That man and mystery

[Famale:]
Were both in you

[Both:]
And in this labyrinth
Where night is blind
The phantom of the opera is there
Inside your/my mind

[PHANTOM:]
Sing my angel of music
                        
                    |
