                        Hey, Ms Red Carpet,
She can autograph my pockets,
Anytime, anyplace, anyway,
I’ll be looking at everybody else,
Watchin,
I don’t wanna de obnoxious,
But this girl worth the gossip,
Take away the smile,
The tattoos now,
forever she very guard less,
I imagine her topless,
She might set off my rocket,
10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1,
On and poppin,
She met Mark and then,
Attitude like we arguing,
With her on the side, celebrate , glitter to my life
I should twitter this is girl, she’s sparkling

[Akon]

She ain’t no Rockstar
But she’s got Groupies,
She ain’t no Actress
But she makes Movies,
And when she struts that thing around
Everybody be breaking their neck like
Who dat girl
Who dat girl
Who dat girl
She ain’t got Riches
But she’s got Fashion,
She ain’t a Model
But camera’s Flashing
And when she struts that thing around
Everybody be breaking their neck like
Who dat girl
Who dat girl
Who dat girl

[Flo Rida]

Hey, they wanna know my mamma’s name,
Cus that where she get from,
They ain’t never shot her with silicon,
Shawty is her and her she’s the real one
Touch one, grab one, feel one,
I wish she would’a told me that
Ain’t nothing wrong bringing the old me back,
Little mamma knows my body so trophy glass,
She worth it, bring me some Chloe bags
Like damn, can I be yo’ police badge
Pull it up, get a little cozy and
Woman is sort’a like and oldie jam,
Record some ssh,
On a playboy cam,
She ain’t no actress
The movie found my matress
Rockstar, none of that practice
But she’s got fanatics

[Akon]

She ain’t no Rockstar
But she’s got Groupies,
She ain’t no Actress
But she makes Movies,
And when she struts that thing around
Everybody be breaking their neck like
Who dat girl
Who dat girl
Who dat girl
She ain’t got Riches
But she’s got Fashion,
She ain’t a Model
But camera’s Flashing
And when she struts that thing around
Everybody be breaking their neck like
Who dat girl
Who dat girl
Who dat girl
Ooh ohh ohh
Look at her
Goo ooo ooo
I wanna know ooh ooh
Who dat girl
Who dat girl
Who dat girl
