                        Japanese girls living in a land so far and lovely
Japanese girls they have set my soul on fire
Japanese girls they're always in my mind
And carry on, carry on, carry on

Chorus:
Japanese girls make me wonder
You are my Japanese girl, I need you so
Japanese girls make me feel good
You are my Japanese girl, I love you so

Japanese girls lovely as a dream - it's like a vision
Japanese girls make me feel so good, just like in heaven
Japanese girls they're always in my heart
And carry on, carry on, carry on

(chorus)
Japanese girls they're always in my heart
And carry on, carry on, carry on
                        
                    |
