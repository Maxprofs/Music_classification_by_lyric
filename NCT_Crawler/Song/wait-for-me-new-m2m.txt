                        You're tired of longing 
And waiting by the phone
And all you get from me 
Is a sappy love song

But I'm tired of flying and hearing the busy tone
Well, I sing for a lot of people 
but I'm also sleeping alone

Wait for me
I'll come back to you,
You know because I want to
Wait for me
Will you make it through?
Please tell me that you'll 
Wait for me
And I will wait for you

You want me to come back 
A perfect summer day
Where we can be together 
That's what you always say

I know I'll maybe come back 
A day or two in May
But, maybe I won't leave again
Yes maybe I will stay

Wait for me
I'll come back to you,
You know because I want to
Wait for me
Will you make it through?
Please tell me that you'll 
Wait for me
And I will wait for you

You know that I will
Waiting for you
I'm waiting here still
Still waiting for you
And I hope that you will

Wait for me
I'll come back to you,
You know because I want to
Wait for me
Will you make it through?
Please tell me that you'll 
Wait for me
And I will wait for you
                        
                    |
