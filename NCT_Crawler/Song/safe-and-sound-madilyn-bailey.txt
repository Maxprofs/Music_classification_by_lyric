                        Bài hát: Safe And Sound - Madilyn Bailey

I remember tears streaming down your face
When i said, i'll never let you go
When all those shadows almost killed your light
I remember you said, don't leave me here alone
But all that's dead and gone and passed tonight
Just close your eyes
The sun is going down
You'll be alright
No one can hurt you now
Come morning light
You and I'll be safe and sound
Don't you dare look out your window darling
Darling everything on fire
The war outside our door keeps raging on
Hold onto lullaby
Even when the music's gone
Just close your eyes
The sun is going down
You'll be alright
No one can hurt you now
Come morning light
You and I'll be safe and sound
                        
                    |
