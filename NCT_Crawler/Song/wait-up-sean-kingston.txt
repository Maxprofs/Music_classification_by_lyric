Oh would you wait for me shawty? slow down
Don't give my love to nobody, no now
I know i might drive you crazy sometimes
I can never let you go you're all mine
Wooh wooh
Don't give my love to nobody
(kingston maan)
So will you wait up?
You've been loved before it's not the first time
But i swear imma call you my bae (my bae)
Your friends say you're single and moving on now
But me know you're not going far away
They saying i put you down like the rude boy do
You could hear the stories and know they ain't true
You know i wouldn't do you like that
Me wouldn't do you like that girl
Park it, park it, park it
Use the key and
Start it, start it, start it
You love when me
Grind it, grind it, grind it
All on you
So will you wait up?
Oh would you wait for me shawty? slow it down
Don't give my love to nobody, no now
I know i might drive you crazy sometimes
I can never let you go you're all mine
Wooh wooh
Don't give my love to nobody
(kingston maan)
So will you wait up?
Ehh, will you wait for me shawty shawty?
Ehh will you wait?
Ehh, don't give my love to nobody, body
Ehh, don't run away
I know i might drive you crazy sometimes
I can never let you go you're all mine
Wooh wooh
Don't give my love to nobody
(kingston mann)
Đon't give love to nobody when i'm gone oh (oh no)
Cause when i touch down kiss in the Lambo we go
Nobody get to fly till the sun come
Ever since day one i had you by me
At a party let them other girls sit down
Slow down you're the momma hit the bass now
Girl park it, park it, park it
Use the key and
Start it, start it, start it
You love when me
Grind it, grind it, grind it
All on you
So will you wait up?
Oh would you wait for me shawty? slow it down
Don't give my love to nobody, no now
I know i might drive you crazy sometimes
I can never let you go you're all mine
Wooh wooh
Don't give my love to nobody
(kingston maan)
So will you wait up?
Ehh, will you wait for me shawty shawty?
Ehh will you wait?
Ehh, don't give my love to nobody, body
Ehh, don't run away
I know i might drive you crazy sometimes
I can never let you go you're all mine
Wooh wooh
Don't give my love to nobody
