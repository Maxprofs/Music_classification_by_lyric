                        Bài hát : Next To You - Austin Mahone

Hey girl, just look at you
So beautiful and drop dead hot
Tell me, what’s the thing?
What you do with a guy like him?
Hey girl, you’re one of a kind
You’re the best one can be
Tell me, what’s the thing?
Are you taking this love for real?

I see him tryin’ to break your smile
I Get it
But we know that tears never lie

No matter what you say or do
He don’t really care about you
Like I will, I will
I will, I will
Let me know
Whenever you decide to be, to never be alone, believe it
I will, I will
I will be next to you
Baby
I will, I will
I will be next to you

Let the bass kick

Hey girl, what’s up with you
There’s something ‘bout the look in your eyes baby
What is wrong
Just tell what is going on
Why you wasting your time
Saying everything it’s alright baby
What you have, it’s never put a bag of mess

I see him tryin’ to break your smile
I Get it
But we know that tears never lie

No matter what you say or do
He don’t really care about you
Like I will, I will
I will, I will
Let me know
Whenever you decide to be, to never be alone, believe it
I will, I will
I will be next to you
Baby
I will, I will
I will be next to you

Let the bass kick

I see him tryin’ to break your smile
I Get it
But we know that tears never lie

No matter what you say or do
He don’t really care about you
Like I will, I will
I will, I will
Let me know
Whenever you decide to be, to never be alone, believe it
I will, I will
I will be next to you
Baby
I will, I will
I will be next to you
