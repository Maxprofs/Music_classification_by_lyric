1.Trouble will find you , no matter where you go.Oh oh
No matter if you're fast no matter if you're slow.Oh oh.
The eye of the storm and the cry in the morn ohoh.
You fine hor a while but then start to loose control.
He's there in the dark.
He's there in my heart
He's waits in the wind
He's gotta play a part
Trouble is a friend 
Yeah trouble is a friend of mine
Oh oh.....
2. Trouble is the friend but trouble is the foe . Oh oh
And no matter what I feed huim always seem to grow . Oh oh
He sees what I see and he know what I know . Oh oh.
So don't forget as you easy on donw the road
He's there in the dark
He's there in my heart
He waits in the wind
He gotta play a part
Trouble is a friend

So don't alarmed if he takes you by the arm
I won't let him win, but I'm a sucker for his charm.
