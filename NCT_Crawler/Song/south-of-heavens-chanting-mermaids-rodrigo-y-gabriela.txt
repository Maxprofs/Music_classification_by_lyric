                        I surely knew that it was a trap
 Yet my hands they would not listen
 I shoulda known your word was flap
 Comin' out all sweet an drippin'
 He's my high Heaven
 Where could I go, yes but to the Lord
 I been to your house and seen what You adore
 I left there stiff, stiff as a board
 Where could I go but to the Lord
 He's my high Heaven
 You can say I'm on Heaven
 When will I hurt for Heaven's sake
 When will I suffer for the sake of Heaven
 When will I hurt for Heaven's sake
 When will I suffer for the sake of Heaven
 All my love yeah, well it is madness
 Freely given to you folks with gladness
 I will not live and die, no not by the sword
 I am weak without the joy of the Lord
 Yeah He's my high Heaven
 Taste and see that the Lord is good
 Let's bend our knees like we know we should
 We can't see clear no, our eyes are made of wood
 Taste and see boy that the Lord is good
 He's my high Heaven
 You can say I'm on Heaven
 When will I hurt for Heaven's sake
 When will I suffer for the sake of Heaven
 When will I hurt for Heaven's sake
 When will I suffer for the sake of Heaven
 When will I hurt for Heaven's sake, I Heaven sake
 When will I suffer for the sake of Heaven
