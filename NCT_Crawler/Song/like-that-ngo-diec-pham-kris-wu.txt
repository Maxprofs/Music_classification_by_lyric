I'm about to throw away my money, on you

Putting on a show for sure, aye
Feels so good inside, I know just your style
Feel these thoughts arise, we can get it right though

I don't know if you ride or die
I don't know if you 'bout this life
I don't know if you tryna play
Let me know if you're tryna play
We can get it on in the nights like this
We can get it all in the nights like this
Turn me up like a fire

Heat me up burn me up like a lighter
I'm about to throw away my money, on you
I'm about to throw it all
Tell me what you want and we goin', it's on you
Anything you want, it's ours
I ain’t never seen a girl like that
Tell me if we took a chance like that

Keep on doing what I like like that
Girl like that
Tell me if we took a chance like that
Got me spending all my cash like that
Keep on doing what I like like that
I don't know if you ride or die

We can go, we can take new heights like this
We can get it on in the nights like this
Turn me up like a fire
Heat me up burn me up like a lighter
