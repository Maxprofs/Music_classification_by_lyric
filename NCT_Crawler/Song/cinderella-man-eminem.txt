[00:-02.80]Eminem - Cinderella Man

Yeah,
You know technically,
I'm not even really supposed to be here right now,
So *** it,
Mine as well make the most of it.

Yeah, haha
Feels good,
Whooo,
Guess I'm lucky,
Some of us don't get a second chance.
But I ain't blowing this one.
Naw man, haha,
*** I feel like I can do anything now

Who can catch lightning in the bottle,
Set fire to water,
Commin out the nozzle on the fire hose,
Quiet and ...(?)

Cinderella man,
Cinderella man,
Cinderella man,
Cinderella man.

Smash an hour glass,
Grab the sand,
Take his hands an cuff em,
Spin around to freeze the clock,
Take the hands of time an cuff em.

Cinderella man,
Cinderella man,
Cinderella man,
Cinderella man.

There's a storm comming that the weather man couldn't predict,
I start the ball *** you better flee cuz I get ticked
It's a rap, I was down, when I was down I was kicked
I got up
I'm bout to punch ya to the ground, ya trick,
It's a trap,
*** my last cd this ***s in my trash,
I be god damned if another rapper gets in my ass,
I hit the gas and I spit every rap as if it's my last.
You can die in the blink of an eye,
So batching ya eyelashes, and keep winking and blown kisses
Cuz your flirting with death
I'm destroying your livelihood, I ain't just hurting your rep,
I catch a flow and get goin',
No remorse, I'm showin' they slowin', for no one,
Knowing there is nothing you can do about it
Zeroing on the target like a marksman,
The target is you,
I shut ya lane down,
Took ya spot, parked in it too,
Watchin' it flow, lighter fluid, saliva what can ya do,
Go get ya crew to hype ya up stand behind you like whoooo!
That boys hot enough to melt hell burn satan too,
Fry his ass, and put his asses back together with glue,
See you can hate em, he don't blame you frankly he would too,
This game could I'll afford to lose him. How bout you?

Now guess who (hey),
Here's a clue (hey),
He came to a ball in a wife beater
Lost his nike shoe,
It's in ya ass (hey),
He's in ya ass, he's all up in ya psychy too,
Now what's his name

Cinderella man,
Cinderella man,
Cinderella,
Cinderella man,
Cinderella man,

If I had a time machine, I'm passing ya,
Cinderella man,
Cinderella man,
Cinderella man,
Cinderella man,
Music is my time machine ahhh ohhhhh,
Cinderella man,
Cinderella man,
Cinderella man,
Cinderella man,

*** catching a lightnin'
He struck it
Screamed shut up and thunder,
Flipped the world upside down and made it rain upward

Cinderella man
Cinderella man
Cinderella man
Cinderella man,

Rewound the future to the present,
Paused it don't ask how,
*** the past mother***er
He's the *** right now he's

Cinderella man
Cinderella man
Cinderella man
Cinderella man..

Cinderella man
Send the fellow shady dang came to rap the game up
And sell the fame,
Raise hell from hell he came,
But didn't come to bore you with the cinderella story,
Nor did he come to do the same,
He can't afford to be a label in this day in age,
And at this stage of the game
Mediocrity cannot be allowed to fly,
So say bye,
To the o h i,
To the new case of rock
Consider it as last of rod, coop degraw
Raise em high in the sky,
Keep em up
Time to bring the place alive,
Thanks for being patient
I will make no more mistakes,
*** my potatoes baked,
Homie the veggies on my plate can fly,
My filet is smoking weed,
Get back if the steaks are high,
*** I ain't even suppose to be here
By the grace of god,
The skin on my teeth
And the hair on my nuts
I skated by,
Now y'all are on thin ice
With anchor weights I hate to lie,
How ***in' irritated are you,
How much in ya face am I,
It ain't *** you could do beferret,
Prove us here in spirit
I'm the spittinn image
I'll mirror it
When I stand near it,
Your pussy lyric,
I couldn't hear it,
Who forms pyramids and raps circles around square lyrics,
Who?
Here's a clue.
He came to the ball in his wifebeater,
Lost his nike shoe, it's in ya ass, he's in ya ass,
He's all up in ya psychy too.

Cinderella man,
Cinderella man,
Cinderella,
Cinderella man
Cinderella man,

If I had a time machine, I'm passing ya,
Cinderella man,
Cinderella man,
Cinderella man,
Cinderella man,
Music is my time machine so call me
Cinderella man,
Cinderella man,
Cinderella man,
Cinderella man.
