                        Hmm, hmm, hmm Hmm, hmm, hmm
Sometimes I get so weird I even freak myself out I laugh myself to sleep it's my lullaby
Sometimes I drive so fast Just to feel the danger I want to scream it makes me feel alive
Is it enough to love? Is it enough to breathe? Somebody rip my heart out And leave me here to bleed Is it enough to die? Somebody save my life I'd rather be anything but ordinary please
To walk within the lines Would make my life so borin' I want to know that I have been To the extreme (I feel) So knock me off my feet (I feel) Come on now give it to me (Ohh) Anything to make me feel alive
Is it enough to love? Is it enough to breathe? Somebody rip my heart out And leave me here to bleed Is it enough to die? [ From: http://www.metrolyrics.com/anything-but-ordinary-lyrics-avril-lavigne.html ] Somebody save my life I'd rather be anything but ordinary please I'd rather be anything but ordinary please
Let down your defenses Use no common sense If you look, you will see That this world is a beautiful, accident (La, la, la, la) Turbulent, succulent, opulent Permanent, no way (La, la, la, la) I wanna taste it Don't wanna waste it away yeah, yeah
Sometimes I get so weird I even freak myself out I laugh myself to sleep it's my lullaby
Is it enough? Is it enough? Is it enough to breathe? Somebody rip my heart out (Somebody) And leave me here to bleed Is it enough to die? Somebody save my life I'd rather be anything but ordinary please
Is it enough? Is it enough to die? Somebody save my life I'd rather be anything but ordinary please, ohh I'd rather be anything but ordinary please
