                        Bài hát: I Run To You - Missio

[Verse 1]
Oh, I run to you, I run to
You
I'll keep chasing you, keep chasing
You
I don't judge you, Love, I never have before
We make mistakes, we leave them by the door

[Chorus]
I-I-I run to you, Love
I-I-I run to you, Love

[Verse 2]
I'll wait for you, I'll wait for
You
Don't quit on me, don't quit on
Me
Please trust me now, trust me
Now
I won't hurt you, Love, won't hurt you,
Love

[Chorus] x7
                        
                    |
