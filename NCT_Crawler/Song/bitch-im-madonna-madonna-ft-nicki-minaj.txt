                        Bài hát: Bitch I'm Madonna - Madonna, Nicki Minaj

You can’t touch this
Cause I’m a bad bitch

We hit the elevator right up to the rooftop
The bass is pumpin’, make me wanna screw the top off
Yeah we’ll be drinking and nobody’s gonna stop us
And we’ll be kissing anybody that’s around us
I just wanna have fun tonight
(Love this sht tonight)
Love me under the flashing light

Make me blow up this house tonight

We go hard or we go home
We gon’ do this all night long
We get freaky if you want
Na na na na
We go hard or we go home
We gon’ do this all night long
We get freaky if you want
Bitch I’m Madonna

We’re jumping in the pool
And swimming with our clothes on
Î brought a pee-wee to my show and got my freak on
The neighbors pissed and says hes gonna call the Five-O
If that’s your weapon we gon’ give a good show

I just wanna have fun tonight
Love me under the flashing light

Make me blow up this house tonight

We go hard or we go home
We gon’ do this all night long
We get freaky if you want
Na na na na
We go hard or we go home
We gon’ do this all night long
We get freaky if you want
Bitch I’m Madonna

Who do you think you are?
You gonna treat this love this time
Ooh, oh, oh ooh
Who do you think you are

[Nicki Minaj]
Hold up with my nose up
And that rose up in that 
I’m froze up, but my stove up
Cause he eatin’ like this his dinner
I run ***, I don’t fall back
Cause I’m on track, I’m a sprinter
I’m bossed up, I got em all struck
I’m the winner
Beep beep, bitch move
‘Fore I bang bang with that uzk
That’s miu miu on my shoes
Ain’t got a thing left for me to prove
It’s that bottle service all night
It’s that poppin’ urban just right
It’s that go hard or go home zone
Bitch, I’m Madonna, these hoes know

We go hard or we go home
We gon’ do this all night long
We get freaky if you want
Na na na na
We go hard or we go home
We gon’ do this all night long
We get freaky if you want
Bitch I’m Madonna

You’re gonna love this
You can’t touch this
Cause I’m a bad bitch

Who do you think you are?
