                        Song: Fly Away - Sugarland

Oh I swear this town gets smaller everyday
 And I'm waitin for my chance, I'm gonna break away
 I'm so sick and tired of being told what's good for me
 People got lots of ideas of who I'm supposed to be Angel carry me, oh so far away
 May my body never touch the ground
 And If I promise you I'll be back someday
 Will you set me free so I can fly away?
 Fly away, fly away Well most folks here well they don't dig too deep
 They can't dream too big 'cause they've got fields to keep
 I could walk away and leave behind my family
 Or get buried alive in this legacy Angel carry me, oh so far away
 May my body never touch the ground
 And If I promise you I'll be back someday
 Will you set me free so I can fly away?
 Fly away, fly away I wanna sleep under a different piece of sky
 I wanna live a little bit before I die
 I wanna be so close to Heaven I see angels Carry me, oh so far away
 May my body never touch the ground
 And If I promise you I'll be back someday
 Will you set me free so I can fly away?
 Fly away, fly away
 Fly away, fly away
