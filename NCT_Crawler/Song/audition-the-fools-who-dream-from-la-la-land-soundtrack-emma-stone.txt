                        Bài hát: Audition (The Fools Who Dream) (From "La La Land" Soundtrack) - Emma Stone

My aunt used to live in Paris
I remember, she used to come home and tell us
stories about being abroad and
I remember that she told us she jumped in the river once,
Barefoot

She smiled,
Leapt, without looking
And tumble into the sand
The water was freezing
she spent a month sneezing
but said she would do it, again

Here's to the ones
who dream
Foolish, as they may seem
Here's to the hearts
that ache
Here's to the mess
we make

She captured a feeling
Sky with no ceiling
Sunset inside a frame
She lives in her liquor,
and died with a flicker
I'll always remember the flame

Here's to the ones
who dream
Foolish, as they may seem
Here's to the hearts
that ache
Here's to the mess
we make

She told me:
A bit of madness is key
to give us to color to see
Who knows where it will lead us?

And that's why they need us,
So bring on the rebels
The roles from pebbles
The painters, and poets, and plays

And here's to the fools
who dream
Crazy, as they may seem
Here's to the hearts that break
Here's to the mess we make

I trace it all back,
to that
Her, and the snow, and the sand
Smiling through it
She said
She'd do it, Again
                        
                    |
