                        Bài hát: Cartwheels - Ward Thomas

[Verse 1]
I'm, beside you at the mirror
Hi, do I look familiar?
Would you believe that we were happy once
True like an answered prayer
You were mine, and we were rare
Now I fight to find what's left of us

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I give, I give, I give, you never take
I bend, I bend, I bend, so we won't break

[Chorus]
I've been doing cartwheels
Anything to save us
Anything to make you notice me
I've been running circles
Always getting nowhere
Putting on a show, but you won't see

[Post-Chorus]
I've been doing cartwheels
I've been doing cartwheels

[Verse 2]
Bright, as a sparkler light
I write our names across your night
It's only me who sees it fade away
Into shame
That I can't keep you honest blame
That you don't even want this love enough
To make you wanna stay

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I give, I give, I give, you never take it
I still, I still, I still, believe we'll make it

[Chorus]
So I've been doing cartwheels
Anything to save us
Anything to make you notice me
I've been running circles
Always getting nowhere
Putting on a show, but you won't see

[Post-Chorus]
I've been doing cartwheels
I've been doing cartwheels
O-o-oh!

[Bridge]
After everything I've done
You still run and disappear
Maybe all I've got
Is hoping I can show you
How it feels
So I've been doing cartwheels
I've been doing cartwheels
O-o-oh!

[Chorus]
I've been doing cartwheels
Anything to save us
Anything to make you notice me
I've been running circles
Always getting nowhere
Putting on a show, but you won't see

[Post-Chorus]
I've been doing cartwheels
I've been doing cartwheels

[Outro]
I'm, beside you at the mirror
Hi, do I look familiar?
                        
                    |
