                        Bài hát: 1-800-273-8255 - Logic, Juanes, Alessia Cara, Khalid

[Pre-Chorus: Logic]
I've been on the low
I been taking my time
I feel like I'm out of my mind
It feel like my life ain't mine
(Who can relate? Woo!)
I've been on the low
I been taking my time
I feel like I'm out of my mind
It feel like my life ain't mine

[Chorus: Juanes]
Y ya no quiero esperar
Por alguien que venga a salvarme
No puedo esperarte hoy
No puedo sanar
Ya no quiero esperar
Por alguien que venga a salvarme
No puedo sanar
Y déjame explicar

[Verse 1: Logic]
All this other *** I'm talkin' 'bout they think they know it
I've been praying for somebody to save me, no one's heroic
And my life don't even matter, I know it, I know it
I know I'm hurting deep down but can't show it
I never had a place to call my own
I never had a home, ain't nobody callin' my phone
Where you been? Where you at? What's on your mind?
They say every life precious but nobody care about mine


[Pre-Chorus: Juanes & Logic]
En este dolor, buscando una señal
Siento que mi mente está mal
Como una vida no tan real
(Who can relate? Woo!)
I've been on the low
I been taking my time
I feel like I'm out of my mind
It feel like my life ain't mine

[Chorus: Juanes & Logic]
Yo quiero verte soñar
Yo quiero verte volar
Y no te dejes caer
No te sientas mal
I want you to be alive
I want you to be alive
You don't gotta die
Now let me tell you why

[Verse 2: Alessia Cara]
It's the very first breath
When your head's been drowning underwater
And it's the lightness in the air
When you're there
Chest to chest with a lover
It's holding on, though the road's long
And seeing light in the darkest things
And when you stare at your reflection
Finally knowing who it is
I know that you'll thank God you did


[Verse 3: Logic]
I know where you been, where you are, where you goin'
I know you're the reason I believe in life
What's the day without a little night?
I'm just tryna shed a little light
It can be hard
It can be so hard
But you gotta live right now
You got everything to give right now

[Pre-Chorus: Logic & Juanes]
I've been on the low
I been taking my time
I feel like I'm out of my mind
It feel like my life ain't mine
(Who can relate? Woo!)
En este dolor, buscando una señal
Siento que mi mente está mal
Como una vida no tan real

[Chorus: Logic & Juanes]
I finally wanna be alive
I finally wanna be alive
I don't wanna die today
I don't wanna die
Ahora quiero respirar
Ahora yo quiero soñar
No quiero fallar
I don't wanna die


[Bridge]
I just wanna live
I just wanna live

[Outro: Khalid]
Pain don't hurt the same, I know
The lane I travel feels alone
But I'm moving 'til my legs give out
And I see my tears melt in the snow
But I don't wanna cry
I don't wanna cry anymore
I wanna feel alive
I don't even wanna die anymore
Oh I don't wanna
I don't wanna
I don't even wanna die anymore
                        
                    |
