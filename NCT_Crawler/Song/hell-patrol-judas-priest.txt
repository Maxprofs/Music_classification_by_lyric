                        Like wild fire
 Comes roaring
 Mad whirlwind
 Burning the road
 Black thunder
 White lightning
 Speed demons cry The Hell patrol
 The Hell patrol Night riders
 Death dealers
 Storm bringers
 Tear up the ground
 Fist flying
 Eyes blazing
 They're glory bound The Hell patrol
 The Hell patrol Brutalize you
 Neutralize you
 Gonna go for your throat as you choke
 Then they'll vaporapeize you
 Terrorize you
 Pulverize you
 Gonna cut to the bone as you groan
 And they'll paratamize you Chrome masters
 Steel warriors
 Soul stealers
 Ripping out hearts
 They're devil dogs The Hell patrol
 The Hell patrol
