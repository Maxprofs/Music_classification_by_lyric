                        All I ever wanted
was to see you smiling
I know that I love you
Oh baby why don't you see

All I ever wanted
was to see you smiling
All I ever wanted
was to make you mine
I know that I love you
Oh baby why don't you see
That all I ever wanted
Was you and me

I'm so alone
Here on my own
And I'm waiting for you to come
I want to be a part of you
Think of fool things we could do
And I begin
You're in my hand
I want to have you in my bed
You are the world 
You're in my eyes
For I have all I want in my live

All I ever wanted
Was to see you smiling
All I ever wanted
was to make you mine
I know that I love you
Oh baby why don't you see
That all I ever wanted
was you and me
