                        Sonically, we're in control
 We're the diamond in your soul
 Images come thick and fast
 From the future, from the past The film starts, the film ends
 Nothing is said in between
 Just sudden moments from someone else's story
 Will it ever be the same again? Hours filled with conversation, no attention paid
 Too distracting convention, no need for friends
 Will it ever be the same again
 Will it ever be the same again? You're original with your own path
 You're original, got your own way
 You're original with your own path
 You're original, got your own way Will it ever be the same again
 Will it ever be the same again?
 I need to hear that again
 Because a dream starts and a dream must end My mother told me, "Don't ever change
 You're original in your own way"
 My mother told me, "Don't ever change
 You're original, got your own path" You're original, you're original
 Will it ever be the same again
 Will it ever be the same again
 I need to hear that again
 Because a dream starts and a dream must end You're original, you're original, you're original
 You're original, you're original
