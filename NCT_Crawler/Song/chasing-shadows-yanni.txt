I have been sailing across the oceans
Flying across the blue sky
Without never finding the answer
The answer to the question why

Just when you think you reach it, it's gone

Chasing Shadows, Chasing shadows
Chasing Shadows, all your life
You're Chasing Shadows, Chasing Shadows
Chasing Shadows, all your life

Harder you try to fix things in your life
Faster you know it's in vain
Searching for loving from strangest places
Nothing is left but the pain

Just when you think you're reaching it, it's gone

Chasing Shadows, Chasing shadows
Chasing Shadows, all your life
You're Chasing Shadows, Chasing Shadows
Chasing Shadows, all your life

Chasing Shadows, Chasing Shadows
Chasing Shadows, all your life
You're Chasing Shadows, Chasing Shadows
Chasing Shadows, all your life
You're Chasing Shadows, Chasing Shadows
Chasing Shadows, all your life
You're Chasing Shadows, Chasing Shadows
Chasing Shadows, all your life
