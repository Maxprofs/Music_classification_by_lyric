                        Bài hát: I Want U - Alison Wonderland

[Verse 1]
Know you’ve seen it
Don’t try to beat it
I want the pressure off
But it continues
Until I kiss you
So let’s just take it off
We’ve waited all night
Spoken until sunlight
Can you just take my hand
It’s bittersweet when, you know it must end
Just tell me where I stand

[Drop]
I want U
III Want U!

[Verse 2]
You know I like you
I give it to you
Would u just say it’s on?
Why did you come here
If you don’t want to?
The feeling’s just so strong
Just give me one look
To give me some hope
I wish I was alone
Could you just stay here, and let the time pass
I’ll write it in a song

[Drop]
I Want U!
IIII Want U

[Bridge]
I just Want U
I just Want U
I just Want U
I just Want U

[Pre-Chorus]
Just give me one look
Just give me one look
Just give me one look
Just give me one look
Just give me one look
Just give me one look
Just give me one look
Just give me one look

[Drop]
I Want U!
I Want U!

[Outro]
I just Want U
I just Want U
I just Want U
I just Want U
IIII Want U
