Lily Allen - Womanizer

Superstar
Where you from, how's it going?
I know you
Gotta clue, what you’re doing?
You can play brand new to all the other chicks out here
But I know what you are, what you are, baby

Look at you
Gettin' more than just a re-up
Baby, you
Got all the puppets with their strings up
Fakin' like a good one, but I call 'em like I see 'em
I know what you are, what you are, baby

Womanizer, Woman-Womanizer, you’re a Womanizer
Oh, Womanizer, oh you’re a Womanizer, baby
You, You, You are, you, you, you are
Womanizer, Womanizer, Womanizer

Boy, don't try to front
I-I know just-just what you are, ah, ah
Boy, don't try to front
I-I know just-just what you are, ah, ah
You got me goin’
You’re oh so charmin’
But I can’t do it ... You Womanizer
Boy, don't try to front
I-I know just-just what you are, ah, ah
Boy, don't try to front
I-I know just-just what you are, ah, ah
You say I’m crazy
I got you’re crazy
You’re nothin’ but a Womanizer

Daddy-O
You got the swagger of a champion
Too bad for you
You just can't find the right companion
I guess when you have one too many, makes it hard
It could be easy, who you are
That’s just who you are, baby

Lollipop
Must mistake me--you’re the sucker
To think that I
Would be a victim, not another
Say it, play it how you wanna
But no way I'm ever gonna fall for you,
Never you, baby

Womanizer, Woman-Womanizer, you’re a Womanizer
Oh, Womanizer, oh you’re a Womanizer, baby
You-you-you are ... You-you-you are
Womanizer, Womanizer, Womanizer

Boy, don't try to front
I-I know just-just what you are, ah, ah
Boy, don't try to front
I-I know just-just what you are, ah, ah
You got me goin’
You’re oh so charmin’
But I can’t do it ... You Womanizer
Boy, don't try to front
I-I know just-just what you are, ah, ah
Boy, don't try to front
I-I know just-just what you are, ah, ah
You say I’m crazy
I got you’re crazy
You’re nothin’ but a Womanizer

Maybe if we both lived in a different world
It would be all good, and maybe I could be yaw girl
But I can't 'cause we don't

Womanizer, woman-womanizer, you're a womanizer
Oh, womanizer, oh, you're a womanizer, baby
You, You, You are, you, you, you are
Womanizer, womanizer, womanizer

Boy, don't try to front
I-I know just-just what you are, ah, ah
Boy, don't try to front
I-I know just-just what you are, ah, ah
You got me goin’
You’re oh so charmin’
But I can’t do it ... You Womanizer
Boy, don't try to front
I-I know just-just what you are, ah, ah
Boy, don't try to front
I-I know just-just what you are, ah, ah
You say I’m crazy
I got you’re crazy
You’re nothin’ but a Womanizer
