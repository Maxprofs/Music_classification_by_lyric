                        Chris: When you broke the promise of love
I told you we were through
But there`s still that pain inside me

Lory: Torn between two feelings tonight
I am helpless and blue
We are worlds apart can`t you see

Lory & Chris : But if you miss me
Send a sign to my heart
So I`ll know it`s alright
Send a message of love
In the dark of the night
Oh babe if you miss me
I will feel it inside
And I`ll come back to you
You will turn on a light
And I`ll know that it`s true

Lory: I want you to miss me

Chris: Baby I miss you
Lookin` at the darkness outside
Thoughts are driftin` back home
Baby you are still on my mind

Lory: I`m just feeling lonesome tonight
Cos my dreams are all gone
New ones ain`t so easy to find

Lory & Chris : But if you miss me
Send a sign to my heart
So I`ll know it`s alright
Send a message of love
In the dark of the night
Oh babe if you miss me
I will feel it inside
And I`ll come back to you
You will turn on a light
And I`ll know that it`s true

Lory: I want you to miss me

Chris: Oh Baby I miss you

Lory: I pray you will miss me

Chris: Yes I miss you

Lory: Baby you`re still on my mind

Lory & Chris :But if you miss me
Send a sign to my heart
So I`ll know it`s alright
Send a message of love
In the dark of the night
Oh babe if you miss me
I will feel it inside
And I`ll come back to you
You will turn on a light
And I`ll know that it`s true

Lory: I want you to miss me

Chris: Oh Baby I miss you
