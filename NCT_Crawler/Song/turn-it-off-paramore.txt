[00:-2.00]Paramore - Turn It Off
[00:-1.00]

I scraped my knees while I was praying
And found a demon in my,
Safest haven seems like
It's getting harder to believe in anything
Than just to get lost in all my selfish thoughts

I wanna know what it'd be like
To find perfection in my pride
To see nothing in the light
I'll turn it off, in all my spite
In all my spite,
I'll turn it off

And the worst part is
Before it gets any better
We're headed for a cliff
And in the free fall I
Will realize I'm better off
When I hit the bottom

The tragedy, it seems unending
I'm watching everyone I looked up to break and bending
We're taking shortcuts and false solutions
Just to come out the hero

Well, I can see behind the curtain
The wheels are cranking, turning
It's all wrong, the way we're working
Towards a goal that's non-existent
It's not existent, but we just keep believing

And the worst part is
Before it gets any better
We're headed for a cliff
And in the free fall I,
Will realize I'm better off
When I hit the bottom

I wanna know what it'd be like
To find perfection in my pride
To see nothing in the light
I'll turn it off, in all my spite
In all my spite, I'll turn it off
Just turn it off
Againnnnnn,
Again, again

And the worst part is
Before it gets any better
We're headed for a cliff
And in the free fall I
Will realize I'm better off
When I hit the bottom

And the worst part is
Before it gets any better
We're headed for a cliff
And in the free fall I
Will realize I'm better off
When I hit the bottom
