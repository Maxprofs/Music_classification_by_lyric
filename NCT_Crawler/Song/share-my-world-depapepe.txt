                        Bài hát: Share My World - Depapepe

See you at the station, rain pours down on the pavement
Is there really no one waiting up back home
They may say I’m crazy, ‘cos I take things way so easy,
But they don’t know how much I’ve got to show
Dreaming of you always, Riding on the subway
Sitting all alone it seems so wrong
See how hard you’re working, Things they got you are doing
Nothing but the night to call your own

But under moonlit clouds and seaside sounds, I feel so fine
Tell me anything you want to do, anywhere you want to go
I’m the one who take you there, music play up in the air,
Get away from everyone, Padapadapada in the sun, have some fun.

*Just let it go, now I know
You need a little time before you make your move
But I’m patient baby, for when you are ready
So come share my world.
Oh don’t you know, now I’m yours
I’d give you all the time, my lovin’ heart and soul
So what I’m thinking baby, whenever you are ready
Just be right here beside me so we can finally be who we are.

No more hesitation, no more endless waiting,
Spending all our time a world apart
We should be together, Times only get better
come on, now please don’t break my heart

‘Cos under moonlit clouds with seaside sounds, I feel ‘sabai’
Tell me anything you want to do, anywhere you want to go
I’m the one to take you there, music play up in the air,
Get away from everyone, Padapadapada in the sun, have some fun.
