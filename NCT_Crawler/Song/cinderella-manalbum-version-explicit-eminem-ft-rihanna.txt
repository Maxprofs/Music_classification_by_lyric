                        Yeah,
 You know technically,
 I'm not even really supposed to be here right now,
 So *** it,
 Might as well make the most of it.

 Amen (8x)

 Yeah, haha
 Feels good,
 Whooo,
 Guess I'm lucky,
 Some of us don't get a second chance.
 But I aint blowing this one.
 Naw man, haha,
 *** I feel like I can do anything now

 Who can catch lightning in the bottle,
 Set fire to water,
 Commin out the nozzle on the fire hose,
 Flyer than swatters.

 Cinderella man, cinderella man, cinderella man, cinderella man.

 Smash an hour glass,
 Grab the sand,
 Take his hands an cup em,
 Spin around to freeze the clock,
 Take the hands of time an cuff em.

 Cinderella man, cinderella man, cinderella man, cinderella man.

 There's a storm commin that the weather man couldn't predict,
 I start to ball *** you better flee cuz I get ticked
 It's a wrap, I was down, when I was down I was kicked
 I got up
 I'm back to punch ya to the ground, ya tricked,
 It's a trap,
 *** my last cd that s***s in my trash,
 I be god damned if another rapper gets in my ass,
 I hit the gas and I spit every rap as if it's my last.
 You can die in the blink of an eye,
 So bat ya eyelashes, and keep winking and blowin kisses
 Cuz your flirting with death
 I'm destroying your livelihood, I aint just hurting your rep,
 I catch a flow and get goin,
 No remorse, I'm showinn they slowin, for no one,
 Knowin there is nothing you can do about it
 Zeroin on the target like a marksman,
 The target is you,
 I shut ya lane down,
 Took ya spot, parked in it too,
 Arsenic flow, lighter fluid, saliva what can ya do,
 Go get ya crew to hype ya up stand behind you like wooooh!
 That boys hot enough to melt hell burn satan too,
 Fry his ass, and put his ashes back together with glue,
 So you can hate em, he don't blame you frankly he would too,
 This game could I'll afford to lose him,
 How bout you?

 Now guess who who (hey),
 Heres a clue (hey),
 He came to a ball in a wife beater
 Lost his nike shoe,
 It's in ya ass (hey),
 He's in ya ass, he's all up in ya psyche too,
 Now what's his name

 Cinderella man,
 Cinderella man,
 Cinderella,
 Cinderella man,
 Cinderella man,

 If I had a time machine, I'd be
 Cinderella man,
 Cinderella man,
 Cinderella man,
 Cinderella man,
 Music is my time machine so call me,
 Cinderella man,
 Cinderella man,
 Cinderella man,
 Cinderella man,

 *** catching lightnin
 He struck it
 Screamed shut up at thunder,
 Flipped the world upside down and made it rain upward
 Cinderella man
 Cinderella man
 Cinderella man
 Cinderella man,

 Rewound the future to the present,
 Paused it don't ask how,
 *** the past mother***er
 He's the *** right now he's

 Cinderella man
 Cinderella man
 Cinderella man
 Cinderella man...

 Cinderella man
 Send the fellow Shady dang came to wrap the game up
 In cellophane,
 Raise hell from hell he came,
 But didn't come to bore you with the cinderella story,
 Nor did he come to do the same old,
 Can't afford to be a lamo in this day in age,
 And at this stage of the game
 Mediocrity can no longer be allowed to fly,
 So say bye,
 To the old
 H-I, To the new, casera
 Consider it his last hoorah,
 To coup de gra
 Raise em high in the sky,
 Keep em up
 Time to bring the place alive,
 Thanks for bein patient
 I will make no more mistakes,
 *** my, potatoes baked,
 Homie the veggies on my plate can fly,
 My filet is smoking weed,
 Yeah faggot the steaks are high,
 *** I aint even suppose to be here
 By the grace of god,
 The skin on my teeth
 And the hair on my nuts
 I skated by,
 Now y'all are on thin ice
 With ankle weights I'd hate to lie,
 How ***in irritated are you,
 How much in ya face am I,
 And aint *** you could do but fear it,
 Proof us here in spirit
 I'm his spittinn image
 I'll mirror it
 When I stand near it,
 Your pussy lyric,
 I c*** hear it,
 Who forms pyramids and raps circles around square lyricists,
 Who?
 Heres a clue.
 He came to the ball in his wifebeater,
 Lost his nike shoe, it's in ya ass, he's in ya ass,
 He's all up in ya psyche too.
 Now, what's his name...

 Cinderella man,
 Cinderella man,
 Cinderella,
 Cinderella man,
 Cinderella man,

 If I had a time machine,
 Cinderella man,
 Cinderella man,
 Cinderella man,
 Cinderella man,

 Music is my time machine, so call me,

 Cinderella man,
 Cinderella man,
 Cinderella man,
 Cinderella man
