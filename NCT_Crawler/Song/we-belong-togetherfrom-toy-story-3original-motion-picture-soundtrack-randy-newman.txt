                        Don't you turn your back on me, 
 Don't you walk away.
 Don't you tell me that I don't care, 
 Cause' I do.

 Don't you tell me, I'm not the one, 
 Don't you tell me, I ain't no fun, 
 Just tell me you love me, like I love you.
 You know you do.

 When we're together, 
 Gray skies are clearer.
 And I'll share them, till where I'm less depressed.
 And it's sincerely, from the bottom of my heart, 
 I just can't take it when we're apart.

 We belong together, 
 We belong together.
 Yes, we do, 
 You'll be mine, forever.

 We belong together, 
 We belong together.
 Oh, it's true, 
 It's gonna stay this way, forever, 
 Me and you.

 If I could really talk to you, 
 If I could find a way.
 I'm not shy, 
 There's a whole lot I wanna say, 
 Oh of course there is! 

 Talk about friendship, and loyal things.
 Talk about how much you mean to me.
 And I'll promise, to always be by your side, 
 Whenever you need me.

 The day I met you, 
 Was the luckiest day of my life.
 And I bet you feel the same.
 At least I hope you do.
 So don't forget, 
 If the future should take you away, 
 That you'll aways be part of me.

 We belong together, 
 We belong together.
 Wait and see.
 Gonna be this way, forever.

 We belong together, 
 We belong together.
 Honestly, 
 We'll go on this way, forever, 
 Me and you, 
 You and me.
