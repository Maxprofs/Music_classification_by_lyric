                        Now if your feelin' kinda low 'bout the dues
 you've been payin'
 Future's comin' much too slow
 And you wanna run but somehow you just keep on stayin'
 Can't decide on which way to go CHORUS
 I understand about indecision
 But I don't care if I get behind
 People living in competition
 All I want is to have my peace of mind Now you're climbing to the top of the company ladder
 Hope it doesn't take too long
 Can't you see there'll come a day when it won't matter
 Come a day when you'll be gone CHORUS Take a look ahead
 Take a look ahead
 Yea,yea,yea, yea Now everybody's got advice they just
 keep on givin'
 Dosen't mean too much to me
 Lots of people have to make believe
 they're livin'
 Can't decide who they should be CHORUS Take a look ahead
 Take a look ahead
 Yea,yea,yea, yea Look ahead!
