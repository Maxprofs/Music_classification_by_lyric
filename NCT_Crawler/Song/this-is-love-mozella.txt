                        Bài hát: This Is Love - MoZella

Yeah Yeah Woah Yeah
 I knew it from the second I laid eyes on you
I had the feeling from the start
And everyday said she came my way

I knew that you were stealin' my heart

And I said this is Loooooove
Loooove Loooove
This is... Loooooove
Loooove Loooove
This is love, love, love This is love, love, love This is love

You brighten up the morning with this smile so big
You fill my day with happiness
And if it's right when you hold me tight
I've never known a love like this

And I said this is Loooooove
Loooove Loooove
This is... Loooooove
Loooove Loooove
This is love, love, love This is love, love, love This is love

And I'm gonna celebrate celebrate today
'Coz I found you
And I'm gonna celebrate celebrate today
'Coz you found me
And I'm gonna celebrate celebrate today
'Coz we found Loooooove
OoooV OoooV
We found Loooooove
OoooV OoooV

This is... Loooooove
Loooove Loooove
This is... Loooooove
Loooove Loooove
This is love, love, love
This is love, love, love
This is love
This is love
Yeah yeah This is love!
