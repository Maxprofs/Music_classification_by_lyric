The sound of silence-Simon & Garfunkel (&
Hello darkness my old friend.,,
I've come 2 talk with U again.
Because a vision softly creeping.
Left its seeds while I was sleeping.
And the vision that was planted in my brain.
Still remains.
Within the sound of silence
In restless dreams I walk alone.
Narrow streets of cobble stone.
'Neath the halo of a street lamp.
I turned my collar 2 the cold & damp.
When my eyes were stabbled by the flash of a neon light.
That split the night.
And touched the sound of silence.
And in the naked night I saw.
Ten thousand people maybe more.
People talking without speaking.
People hearing without listening.
People writing songs that voices never share.
And no one dare.
Disturb the sound of silence.
"Fool" said I "U do not know.":",
"Silence like a cancer grows."
Hear my words that I might teach U.",
"Take my arms that I might reach U.",
But my words like silent rain-drops fell.
And echoed in the wells of silence.
And the people bow & prayed.
To the neon God they made.
And the sign flash out its warning.()
In the words that it was forming)
And the sign said "The words of the prophers.:
Are written the subway walls & tenement halls".
And whispered in the sounds of silence.
                        
                    |
