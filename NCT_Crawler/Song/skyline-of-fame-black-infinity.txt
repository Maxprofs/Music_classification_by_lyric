                        Song: Skyline Of Fame - Black Infinity

Like the God seeds needle from the ground
We convince ourself to the Heaven ( I'm seeing you are fading away)
All the price We paid for the Devil Throne
We sacrifice for the Angels ( All the pains are fading away)
You can climb to the highest moutain
You can swim the deepest sea
All you need is the will you want it
All you need is keep the faith

And I will be there
Get over the Skyline ( All you can do is just to hold me now)
I will steal the Fame
And We will be Forever ( All I ask of You, Are You with Me now?)
LIke the flash of light
In the heaven's sin
We're waiting here for tomorrow ( I'm seeing you are fading away)
This is for the time You have to let it go ( so dont be afraid)
This is for the War We have to fight for ( Over over again)
( Over over again)
( Over over again)

And I will be there
Get over the Skyline ( All you can do is just to hold me now)
I will steal the Fame
And We will be Forever ( All I ask of You, Are You with Me now?)
                        
                    |
