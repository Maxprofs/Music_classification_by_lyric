                        Tell me when will you be mine
 Tell me quando, quando, quando
 We can share a love divine
 Please don't make me wait again When will you say 'yes' to me?
 Tell me quando, quando, quando
 You mean happiness to me
 Oh, my love, please tell me when Ev'ry moment's a day
 Ev'ry day seems a lifetime
 Let me show you the way
 To a joy beyond compare I can't wait a moment more
 Tell me quando, quando, quando
 Say it's me that you adore
 And then, darlin', tell me when (instrumental strings and brass)
 Ev'ry moment's a day
 Ev'ry day seems a lifetime
 Let me show you the way
 To a joy beyond compare I can't wait a moment more
 Tell me quando, quando, quando
 Say it's me that you adore
 And then, darlin', tell me when Oh, my darlin', tell me when
 Mmm, my darlin', tell me when
