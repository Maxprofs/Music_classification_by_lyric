                        If this world were mine, I'd place at your feet
 All that I own, you've been so good to me
 If this world were mine
 I'd give you the flowers, the birds and the bees
 For with your love inside me, that would be all I need
 If this world were mine
 I'd give you anything If this world were mine, I'd make you a king
 With wealth untold, you could have anything
 If this world were mine
 I'd give you each day so sunny and blue
 If you wanted the moonlight, I'd give you that too
 If this world were mine
 I'd give you anything Oh baby, you're my consolation
 And there's no hesitation
 When you want me, honey, just call me And whoah, you're my inspiration
 Yeah, I feel so much sensation
 When I'm in your arms, when you squeeze me, whoah Every sky would be blue
 Long as you're lovin' me Whoa-oa-oah, with you here in my arms life is so wonderful Whoa-oa-oah, give me plenty lovin', baby
 Give me plenty lovin', honey
 Keep on lovin' me
 Whoa-oa-oah, you know I need you, baby
 Reall-really need you, honey
