                        Here we go
 Yo, a day in the life of a player named Quik
 I'm just a stubborn kind of fellow with a head like a brick
 And just because I drink the 8, they say that I'm hopeless
 But I don't give a ***, so blame it on the locust
 Now this is how we do it when we checkin' a grip
 Teddy Bear's in the house, so don't even trip
 We're bustin' funky compositions as smooth as a prism So check it while I kick it to this funky ass rhythm
 It's Friday morning, the phone is ringin' off the hook
 And AMG is puttin' down girl rhymes in his notebook
 Or should I say dope sack, because we don't bust wack
 I pick up the phone and it's the D
 (Whassup nigga?) He said he's comin' down at about two on the dot
 So I'm about to rush the tub while my water's still hot
 And now I'm soakin', a brother like the devestatin' DJ Quik ain't jokin'
 *** with me on DSP and you'll get broken
 My name is Quik, but you can call me Daddy
 Yo, open up the door, they think I'm Freak Man in a Caddy
 Now Freaky's in an El doggin' shabbies in at Alco And everybody's sippin' on a quart
 (Here we go)
 D just came with a forty and a quart
 In addition to the three that Greedy just brought
 But I don't wanna start early, so I just might
 Put my forty in the freezer 'cuz I wanna get bent tonite Tonite's the nite, tonite
 (Yeah)
 Tonite is the nite, tonite
 Tonite's the nite, tonite
 (Yo, when we gon' get bent)
 Tonite is the nite
 (Aww, yeah) And now I'm out of the tub up in a fancy freak
 Spray on some serious and put on my Girbaud jeans
 Sweat suit, the gray one with the burgundy trim
 And it's a medium, fit me proper 'cuz I'm nice and slim
 Five thirty on the clock and the sun is steadily sinkin'
 And I am steadily thinkin' about the 8 that I'll be drinkin'
 You know I ain't ashamed and you know I ain't bashful
 So go on and pop the forty so I can pour me a glassful Ham is in the bedroom rollin' up a stencil
 Fatter than a pinky and the length of a pencil
 Freakie lit it up and hit it one two three
 Shabby took a hit and then they pass it to me, it's the bomb
 Yo, I can feel my senses get numb
 Yo, *** the forty ounce, I need some rum
 I'm chillin' like a villain, here I come and that's how I'm livin'
 Tonite is the nite and I'm lookin' real sporty Proper Friday evening and I'm ready to party
 Crusher came in with a handful of snaps
 *** it, let's shoot some craps
 (Yo, what they in fo')
 A fin or a half
 (Yo, shoot that ten nigga)
 Don't make me laugh
 Hi-C want a dove and he think that *** is funny
 But I'm seven and eleven and I'm takin' niggaz money tonite Tonite's the nite, tonite
 (Yeah, watch me *** the hoe)
 Tonite is the nite, tonite
 (Passin' naturals on mother***ers) Tonite's the nite, tonite
 (Yo, I'm unfadable)
 Tonite is the nite
 (Ahh, let's break it down, so I can get funky)
 Tonite Ahh yeah
 Givin' 'em somethin' they can roll on, hold on Wake up Saturday morning and I got a headache
 I can't believe that I'm sick from all the *** that I drank last nite
 Soon as I felt it comin' on
 I should quit, it's true that a drunk ain't ***
 To the man up above, the whole thanks I give
 I'll never drink again if you just let me live
 Mike P spoke to me and I said I couldn't call it
 Call it Earl like a mother while I'm grippin' the toilet I need a 7-Up, because my head is spinnin'
 'Round and 'round I think I better sit down
 My homey Shot is alright, but I'm feeling faint
 I guess he's used to it, but a nigga like Quik ain't
 K is on the phone, and Teddy's at the door
 Some fine ass bitches comin' over at four
 (I thought you ain't drinkin' no more)
 Yeah right
 Because as soon as they come, we doin' the same ol' *** tonite Tonite's the nite, tonite
 (Yeah)
 Tonite is the nite, tonite
 (Straight gettin' ***ed up, hey) Tonite's the nite, tonite
 (*** that, pass me that pina colada)
 (Man, I don't wanna fade that 8 Ball no mo) Tonite is the nite, tonite
 (That *** be ***in' a nigga up)
 Tonite's the nite
 (Ahh, yeah, nothin' but a party and I'm kickin' it)
 (What's up Pete and Greg)
 Tonite Tonite is the nite, tonite
 (How you livin'?)
 Tonite's the nite
 (Hey, somebody get that nigga a Genuine Draft)
 (Yeah)

 (And on that mother***in' note, I'm outta here)
 (See-ya)

 Tonite We out, *** peace nigga, give me another brew
 (What about peace?)
