                        Yo
 Keyshia Cole
 Your boy Juicy J
 It's time
 When a woman is fed up
 If she done had enough
 Better watch out
 It's goin' down, yeah Why does it matter now?
 Who can do you better
 Feet up on your couch,
 Yeah, bitch I'm Rick James
 Yeah, bitch I'm Rick James
 (Yeah bitch) I'm Rick James!
 Slap the bitch like Rick James
 I'm Rick James! If you want my love, 
 Who is the one who's hurtin' now?
 But you can keep your double standards,
 It's funny how the tables turned around Oh bring 'em out out out out out
 Oh right now now now now
 Oh bring 'em out out out out out (you know it)
 Oh right now (tell them Keyshia!)
 Yeah! Why does it matter now?
 Who can do you better
 Feet up on your couch,
 Yeah, bitch I'm Rick James
 Yeah, bitch I'm Rick James
 (Yeah bitch) I'm Rick James!
 Slap the bitch like Rick James
 I'm Rick James! Why does it matter now?
 Who can do you better
 Feet up on your couch,
 Yeah, bitch I'm Rick James
 Yeah, bitch I'm Rick James
 Cold blooded, I'm Rick James!
 Slap the bitch like Rick James
 I'm Rick James! I can see the picture shatter
 And we can pick up the pieces off the ground
 Till the point that nothin' matters
 And it's way too late to talk it out, ooh  Oh bring 'em out out out out out
 Oh right now now now now
 Oh bring 'em out out out out out 
 Oh right now (bring 'em bring 'em out out out) Why does it matter now?
 Who can do you better
 Feet up on your couch,
 Yeah, bitch I'm Rick James
 Yeah, bitch I'm Rick James
 (Yeah bitch) I'm Rick James!
 Slap the bitch like Rick James
 I'm Rick James! ? You gon' pay for it later,
 Baby girl, more cut throat than a razor
 She know what she want, and she know how to get it
 Shawty, know the game, no, nigga you can't play her
 She bad, lookin' like a bag of money
 Make her own bread, fat ass and flat stomach
 She know she never gotta ask for nothin'  
 These chicks hatin' 'cause they ain't half the woman
 Shawty came home he started runnin' his mouth
 She took her earrings off an get rational, damn!
 Homeboy know lil mama don't play
 He just grab the *** and started packin' (he gone)
 You broke her ? Your life gonna change
 She cold blooded like she got ice in her veins
 Got me chillin' in your house throwin' diamonds on your spouse
 Wipe my feet on your couch, bitch I'm Rick James! Why does it matter now?
 Who can do you better
 Feet up on your couch,
 Yeah, bitch I'm Rick James
 Yeah, bitch I'm Rick James
 (Yeah bitch) I'm Rick James!
 Slap the bitch like Rick James
 I'm Rick James! Why does it matter now?
 Who can do you better
 Feet up on your couch,
 Yeah, bitch I'm Rick James
 Yeah, bitch I'm Rick James
 Cold blooded, I'm Rick James!
 Slap the bitch like Rick James
 I'm Rick James!
