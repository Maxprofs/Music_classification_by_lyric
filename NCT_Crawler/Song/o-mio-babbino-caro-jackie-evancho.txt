                        O mio babbino caro,
 mi piace, belllo bello,
 vo'andare in Porta Rossa
 a comperar l'anello!
 Si, si, ci voglio andare!
 E se l'amassi indarno,
 andrei sul Ponte Vecchio
 ma per buttarmi in Arno!
 Mi struggo e mi tormento,
 O Dio! Vorrei morir! O mio babbino caro,

 I like him, he is very handsome.
