                        Bài hát: Hate Me - Nightcore

He says save me, save me
She says maybe, maybe
She starts to turn away when he says

Hate me
Break me
Let me feel as hurt as you
Push me
Crush me
But promise me you’ll never let us go

Hate me
Break me
Then save me, save me
Push me
Crush me
Then save me, save me

She stops walking, walking
He stops falling, falling
 He looks her in the eyes and he says

Hate me
Break me
Let me feel as hurt as you
Push me
Crush me
But promise me you’ll never let us go

Hate me
Break me
Then save me, save me
Push me
Crush me
Then save me, save

Hate me
Break me
Then save me, save me
Push me
Crush me
Then save me, save me

He says save me, save me
She says maybe, maybe
 He says

Hate me
Break me
Let me feel as hurt as you
Push me
Crush me
But promise me you’ll never let us go
