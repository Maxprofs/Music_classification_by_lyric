                        Was it some man that didn't treat you right?
 Left you reaching out for him in the middle of the night
 Is there some heartache that you can't out run?
 That makes you so afraid to get close to anyone You're so easy to look at, you're so easy to hold
 And it's so easy to touch you but so hard to let go
 It's so easy to want you that I can't get enough
 Tell me why do you have to be
 Why do ya have to be so hard to love? Is it some hurt from long ago
 That makes it so hard to let your feelings show?
 Is it the ghost of who you used to be
 That makes you so afraid to bear your soul to me? You're so easy to look at, so easy to hold
 So easy to touch you honey, so hard to let go
 My love, easy to want you that I can't get enough
 Tell me why do you have to be
 Why do you have to be Tell me, tell me, tell me why do you have to be
 Tell me, yeah, why do you have to be so hard to love?
