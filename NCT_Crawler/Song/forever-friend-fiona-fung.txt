                        I believe I can love
You give me your loving care
I believe in what we are
I don't know where I would be
Without you staying with me
Sometimes I'm lost in misery

You will take me on the way
I'm not afraid
Oh you and me, hand in hand to everywhere
amazing be my friend oh friend
We are forever friends
Oh baby, you give me all the love I need
You are the only one

I believe I can love
You give me your loving care
I believe in what we are

[You will take me on the way
as day by day
Oh you and me, hand in hand to everywhere
amazing be my friend oh friend
We are forever friends
Oh baby, you give me all the love I need
You are the only one] x 2
