                        Bài hát: Rockstar - Nickelback

I'm through with standing in line 
to the clubs I'll never get in
It's like the bottom of the ninth 
and I'm never gonna win
This life hasn't turned out 
quite the way I want it to be

(tell me what you want)

I want a brand new house 
on an episode of Cribs
And a bathroom I can play baseball in
And a king size tub big enough 
for ten plus me

(yeah, so what you need)

I'll need a, a credit card that's got no limit
And a big black jet with a bedroom in it
Gonna join the mile high club 
At thirty-seven thousand feet

(Been there done that)

I want a new tour bus full of old guitars
My own star on Hollywood Boulevard
Somewhere between Cher and 
James Dean is fine for me

(So how you gonna do it?)

I'm gonna trade this life for fortune and fame
I'd even cut my hair and change my name

[CHORUS]
'Cause we all just wanna be big rockstars
Livin' in hilltop houses driving fifteen cars
The girls come easy and the drugs come cheap
We'll all stay skinny cause we just won't eat
And we'll hang out in the coolest bars
In the VIP with the movie stars
Every good gold digger's 
Gonna wind up there
Every Playboy bunny 
with her bleach blonde hair
and well..
Hey hey I wanna be a rockstar
Hey hey I wanna be a rockstar

I wanna be great like Elvis without the tassels
Hire eight body guards that love to beat up assholes
Sign a couple autographs 
So I can eat my meals for free

(I'll have the quesadilla... ha ha)

I'm gonna dress my ass 
with the latest fashion
Get a front door key to the Playboy mansion
Gonna date a centerfold that loves to 
blow my money for me

(So how you gonna do it?)

I'm gonna trade this life 
For fortune and fame
I'd even cut my hair 
And change my name

'Cause we all just wanna be big rockstars
Livin' in hilltop houses driving fifteen cars
The girls come easy and the drugs come cheap
We'll all stay skinny cause we just won't eat
And we'll hang out in the coolest bars
In the VIP with the movie stars
Every good gold digger's 
Gonna wind up there
Every Playboy bunny 
with her bleach blonde hair
And we'll hide out in the private rooms
With the latest dictionary 
in today's who's who
We'll get you anything
with that evil smile
Everybody's got a 
drug dealer on speed dial 
well..
Hey hey I wanna be a rockstar

I'm gonna sing those songs 
that offend the censors
Gonna pop my pills 
from a Pez dispenser
Get washed-up singers writing all my songs
Lip sync 'em every night so I don't get 'em wrong

Well we all just wanna be big rockstars
Livin' in hilltop houses driving fifteen cars
The girls come easy and the drugs come cheap
We'll all stay skinny cause we just won't eat
And we'll hang out in the coolest bars
In the VIP with the movie stars
Every good gold digger's 
Gonna wind up there
Every Playboy bunny 
with her bleach blonde hair
And we'll hide out in the private rooms
With the latest dictionary 
in today's who's who
We'll get you anything 
with that evil smile
Everybody's got a 
drug dealer on speed dial well..
Hey hey I wanna be a rockstar 
Hey hey I wanna be a rockstar
