                        Bài hát: Wildside (From "Adventures In Babysitting") - Sabrina Carpenter, Sofia Carson

My heart is racing, can't stop this feeling
My ground is shaking up
I wanna let go, go crazy
Dance on the ceiling, my world is waiting up

Don't wanna stop, give up
I want it all 'cause I just ain't had enough
Keep up, we're gonna show the world
That there's just no stopping us
No one can hold us back, gonna break the rules
Can't hold this back
Gotta light the fuse in us

I'm living on the wildside, wildside
No telling what I'd might find, might find
No stopping 'cause it feels right, feels right
I'm living on the uuh-uh-uh, uuh-uh-uh
On the Wildside, Wildside
So ready, now it's my time, my time
No stopping 'cause it feels right, feels right
I'm living on the uuh-uh-uh, uuh-uh-uh

I used to think that rude things are so bad
No need to hold back, not me, no more
I'm walking this road, I'm taking control
My heart can't say no!

I'm living on the wildside, wildside
No telling what I'd might find, might find
No stopping 'cause it feels right, feels right
I'm living on the uuh-uh-uh, uuh-uh-uh
On the Wildside, Wildside,
So ready, now it's my time, my time
No stopping 'cause it feels right, feels right
I'm living on the uuh-uh-uh, uuh-uh-uh

I don't wanna live my life by design
Locked inside, break out
Break the rules, light the fuse
Something new that's wild

I'm living on the wildside, wildside
No telling what I'd might find,
No stopping 'cause it feels right,
Uuh-uh-uh
I'm living on the wildside, wildside
No telling what I'd might find, might find
No stopping 'cause it feels right, feels right
I'm living on the uuh-uh-uh, uuh-uh-uh
On the Wildside, Wildside,
So ready, now it's my time, my time
No stopping 'cause it feels right, feels right
I'm living on the uuh-uh-uh, uuh-uh-uh
