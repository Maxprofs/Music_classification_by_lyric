Remember that chick that used to live right up the block from me

yep I still wanna make her mine
I want much more than just a moment
she I ain’t tryna lease or try to rent I’m tryna own it
yeah, this time I’ll make my move, this time I’ll show improve
to prove that I’m really irreplaceable

plus I don’t know if she’s ever been told
but I got whatever she needs, yeah
and whichever way we go
no-one could ever take what we’ve got right here between one another
don’t care what they say, you could be my lover
and if its in love baby, I wanna fall
just promise me baby you’ll be here, through it all

[Nelly]
I’ll do it again if I have to
throw this money at you,
