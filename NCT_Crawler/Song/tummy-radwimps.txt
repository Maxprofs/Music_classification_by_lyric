                        ima kara sensen fukoku futari no kodomo ni kitto boku

 From the tummy of such a mighty little girl
 For the rest of all my days when I say beautiful, you're beautiful
 I'll be always talking about you or your mom, now hey Welcome to the new world
 From the tummy of such a mighty little girl
 I can't find a better reason to live for I'm here for...
 I'm not gonna say it, no I'll never, I'll just keep it in my arms makete bakari mo irarenai yochiyochi aruki mo obotsukanai

 From the tummy of such a mighty little girl
 For the rest of all my days when I say beautiful, you're beautiful
 I'll be always talking about you or your mom, now hey Welcome to the new world
 From the tummy of such a mighty little girl
 I can't find a better reason to live for I'm here for...
 I'm not gonna say it, no I'll never, I'll just keep it in my arms She'll be always mine you better keep that in your mind
 Exception will be never made in case of any kind
 I kept that oath my very first
 but you're the one who broke that first Listen to me; I'll never say twice, I won't tell you much
 So be strong not fist more deeper in you
 I'll always love you but second to your mom, of course
 I can't give it you When ever you're in lack of some warmness
 Or maybe some time you feel hopeless
 There's nothing better to touch
 I guarantee you that, little boy
