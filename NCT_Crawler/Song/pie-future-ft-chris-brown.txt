[Intro: Future & Chris Brown]
Freebandz
Pie, pie
Pie, pie (yeah)
Pie, pie
Nigga sorry, you should know (ooh)
I gotta chick, I'll never be alone (Yeah)
Nigga sorry, you should know (ooh)
You're so so full, you let ya side go

[Chorus: Future & Chris Brown]
I turn the side piece to a 9 piece (oh yeah)
She out lying it shouldn't even matter, she mine
I told her baby, *** it up, one time (*** it up)
Ba-baby, *** it up, one time (ooh)
I turn the side piece to a 9 piece (yeah, ooh)
She out lying, it shouldn't even matter, she mine (ooh)
I told her baby, *** it up, one time (one time)
Ba-baby, *** it up, one time (ooh)

[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
Baby, *** it up
It's your birthday, go 'head, put that cake on me
Diamonds and zeros, I'll be your hero, ain't no cape on me
All you niggas lame, I ain't gotta pay (***)
You know talk is cheap
Ain't talking money, ain't no conversating
I've been leanin' all day, I'm faded
And she been feignin' all day, but can't take dick
Sipping out a 2 litre, put an 8 in it
White linen on my pillow, put her face in it
Baby, *** it up and do what you like
All these drugs in my body got me seeing double
Ménage à trois, double trouble
(This should be fun)

[Chorus: Future & Chris Brown]
I turn the side piece to a 9 piece (ooh)
She out lying it shouldn't even matter, she mine (ooh)
I told her baby, *** it up, one time (*** it up)
Ba-baby, *** it up, one time (ooh)

[Verse 2: Future]
Gassing up on lean and good Percs
Lap dance getting pie on my t-shirt
She know how to ***, yeah
She ain't looking for true love here
Let her see a million, she don't wanna go
I roll a hundred deep, we like sharing hoes
Caviar on your plate, girl wipe your nose (*** it up)
Out of chances, find you three-six-oh

[Chorus: Future & Chris Brown]
I turn the side piece to a 9 piece (oh yeah)
She out lying it shouldn't even matter, she mine
I told her baby, *** it up, one time (*** it up)
Ba-baby, *** it up, one time (ooh)
I turn the side piece to a 9 piece (yeah, ooh)
She out lying it shouldn't even matter, she mine (ooh)
I told her baby, *** it up, one time (one time)
Ba-baby, *** it up, one time (ooh)

[Bridge: Future]
She could never be loyal (loyal)
But she's so fine (so fine)
She gon' make a nigga spoil her (spoil her)
Just to keep her on the side (on the side)
I just want to taste her water
Freebandz
Let's stay hydrated
Girl, I got a main thing at the house (number one)
Tell me, can you stay down?

[Chorus: Future & Chris Brown]
I turn the side piece to a 9 piece (oh yeah)
She out lying it shouldn't even matter, she mine
I told her baby, *** it up, one time (*** it up)
Ba-baby, *** it up, one time
I turn the side piece to a 9 piece (yeah, ooh)
She out lying it shouldn't even matter, she mine (ooh)
I told her baby, *** it up, one time (one time)
Ba-baby, *** it up, one time (ooh)
