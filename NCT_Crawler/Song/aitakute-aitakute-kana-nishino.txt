                        Bài hát: Aitakute Aitakute - Kana Nishino

Ai taku te ai taku te furueru
Kimi omou hodo tooku kanji te
Mouichido kika se te uso demo
Ano hi no you ni " suki da yo " tte ?

Kyou wa kinen bi hontou dattara
Futari sugoshi te i ta ka na
Kitto kimi wa zenbu wasure te
Ano ko to warai atteru no ?
Zutto watashi dake ni kure te ta kotoba mo yasashi sa mo
Daisuki datta egao mo zenbu
Ano ko ni mo mise teru no ?

Baby i know
Kimi wa mou watashi no mono ja nai koto kurai
Demo doushitemo kimi ja nakya dame
Da kara
You are the one

Ai taku te ai taku te furueru
Kimi omou hodo tooku kanji te
Mouichido futari modore tara?
Todoka nai omoi my heart and feelings
Ai tai tte negatte mo ae nai
Tsuyoku omou hodo tsuraku natte
Mouichido kika se te uso demo
Ano hi no you ni " suki da yo " tte ?

I love you hontouwa
I ' m in love with you baby
I love you
But still i can ' t tell my words of love

' Shiawase ni natte ne ' to
Kimi no mae ja otonabutte
Sonna koto kokoro no naka ja
Zettai ni omowa nai

Baby i know
Dare yori kimi no subete o shitteru noni
Demo doushitemo ano ko ja nakya dame na no ?
So tell me why

Ai taku te ai taku te furueru
Kimi omou hodo tooku kanji te
Mouichido futari modore tara ?
Todoka nai omoi my heart and feelings
Ai tai tte negatte mo ae nai
Tsuyoku omou hodo tsuraku natte
Mouichido kika se te uso demo
Ano hi no you ni " suki da yo " tte?

Nan do mo aishi teru to
Itte ta noni doushite
Dakishime te yasashii koe de
Namae o yon de mouichido

Ai taku te ai taku te furueru
Kimi omou hodo tooku kanji te
Mouichido futari modore tara ?
Todoka nai omoi my heart and feelings
Ai tai tte negatte mo ae nai
Tsuyoku omou hodo tsuraku natte
Mouichido kika se te uso demo
Ano hi no you ni " suki da yo " tte?

I miss you, i miss you so much i’m shaking
The more i think of you the further away you feel
Even if it’s a lie, say to me once more
Like you did that day, “i love you...”

If today was our anniversary
I wonder if we’d spend it together
I’m sure you’ve forgotten all about us
Are you laughing with her?

The words and kindness that you always saved just for me
The smile i loved, everything
Do you show them to her too?

Baby i know
That you’re not mine anymore
But i can’t help it, you are the one for me
You are the one

I miss you, i miss you so much i’m shaking
The more i think of you the further away you feel
If we could just go back to the way we were...
My love won’t reach you, my heart and feelings
I can wish to see you again but it won’t happen
The more i think of you the more it hurts
Even if it’s a lie, say to me once more
Like you did that day, “i love you...”

I love you, the truth is
I’m in love with you baby
I love you
But still i can’t tell my words of love

“i hope you find happiness”
I try to act like an adult in front of you
But inside my heart
I don’t feel that way at all

Baby i know
More about you than anyone else
So tell me why does it have to be her?
So tell me why

I miss you, i miss you so much i’m shaking
The more i think of you the further away you feel
If we could just go back to the way we were...
My love won’t reach you, my heart and feelings
I can wish to see you again but it won’t happen
The more i think of you the more it hurts
Even if it’s a lie, say to me once more
Like you did that day, “i love you...”

I said that i loved you so many times
So why is it like this?
Hold me in your arms
And gently say my name once more

I miss you, i miss you so much i’m shaking
The more i think of you the further away you feel
If we could just go back to the way we were...
My love won’t reach you, my heart and feelings
I can wish to see you again but it won’t happen
The more i think of you the more it hurts
Even if it’s a lie, say to me once more
Like you did that day, “i love you...”
