                        Bài hát: We've Saved The Best For Last - Kenny G, Smokey Robinson 

Now that we are older, our hearts have all grown up
Just a little wiser but are we wise enough?
Watching imitations of the real thing
You and I have both been fooled before

But this time we win
Our ship has just come in
(Just come in)
Forget the past
We've saved the best for last
(Saved the best for last)

Now that we are younger than we were last night
You can be my arrow, I'll be your guiding light
There isn't any danger we can't handle

But this time we win
Our ship has just come in
(Just come in)
Forget the past
We've saved the best for last

Tonight entwined
This love is genuine
Forget the past
(Forget)
We've saved the best for last
(Saved the best for last)

We've both had enough of hesitation
Didn't matter, didn't matter

But this time we win
(This time we win)
Our ship has just come in
(Just come in)
Forget the past
(Forget the past)
We've saved the best for last

Tonight entwined
(Tonight entwined)
This love is genuine
Forget the past
(Forget the past)
We've saved the best for last
(Saved the best for last)

But this time we win
(This time we win)
Our ship has just come in
(Just come in)
Forget the past
(Forget the past)
