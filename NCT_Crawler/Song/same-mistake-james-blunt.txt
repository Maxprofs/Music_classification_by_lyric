                        So while I'm turning in my sheets 
And once again I cannot sleep 
Walk out the door and up the street 
Look at the stars beneath my feet 
Remember rights that I did wrong 
So here I go 

Hello, hello 

There is no place I cannot go 
My mind is muddy but 
My heart is heavy does it show 
I lose the track that loses me 
So here I go 

uhuuuu uhuuuu uhuuuu 

And so I sent some men to fight 
And one came back at dead of night 
Said he'd seen my enemy 
Said he looked just like me 
So I set out to cut myself 
And here I go 

uhuuuu uhuuuu uhuuuu 

I’m not calling for a second chance 
I'm screaming at the top of my voice 
Give me reason, but don’t give me choice 
Cause I'll just make the same mistake again 

uhuuuu uhuuuu uhuuuu 

And maybe someday we will face 
And maybe talk but not just speak 
Dont buy the promises cause 
There are no promises I keep 
and my reflection troubles me 
So here I go 

uhuuuu uhuuuu uhuuuu 

I’m not calling for a second chance 
I’m screaming at the top of my voice 
Give me reason, but don’t give me choice 
Cause I'll just make the same mistake 

I’m not calling for a second chance 
I'm screaming at the top of my voice 
Give me reason, but don’t give me choice 
Cause I'll just make the same mistake again 

uhuuuu uhuuuu uhuuuu 

uhuuuu uhuuuu uhuuuu 
So while I'm turning in my sheets 

uhuuuu uhuuuu uhuuuu 
And once again I cannot sleep 

uhuuuu uhuuuu uhuuuu 
Walk out the door and up the street 

uhuuuu uhuuuu uhuuuu 
Look at the stars 

uhuuuu uhuuuu uhuuuu 
Look at the stars falling down 

uhuuuu uhuuuu uhuuuu 
And I wonder where 

uhuuuu uhuuuu uhuuuu 
Did I go wrong
                        
                    |
