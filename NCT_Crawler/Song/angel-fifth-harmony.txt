                        Bài hát: Angel - Fifth Harmony

[Intro: Normani] 
Who said I was an angel? 
Who said I was an angel? Oh, yeah 

[Verse 1: Normani] 
We was just a moment, nothing serious 
Never really paid it no mind 
Drop the back side and paying attention (Shakin' all that, ah) 
Should’ve never not kept your word 
Woulda had a reason to keep mine 
You was too inconsistent (Shakin' all that, ah) 

[Pre-Chorus: Lauren] 
Should've never crossed that line with ya 
Everything was cool, just drinkin’ with ya 
Way too young to be up in handcuffs 
Wasn't tryna spend my life on the phone with ya 
Gotta keep it on 100 with ya 
The original me wouldn't *** with ya 
And I was beginning to *** with ya 

[Chorus: Dinah + Normani & (Lauren)] 
Who said I was an angel? 
Who said I was an angel? (Oh, yeah) 
When you look at me, what do you see? 
Open your eyes, I'm more brilliant than you'll ever be 
Who said I was an angel? 

[Verse 2: Ally] 
Yeah, won't lie, say I don't lie 
Yeah, I might've told a few lies, yeah 
Won’t lie, say I didn’t try 
But you're only worth a few tries, yeah 
Track star, think you’re running these streets 
You ain't the only one running the streets 
They making ground like they only wear cleats, yeah 

[Pre-Chorus: Dinah] 
Should've never crossed that line with ya 
Everything was cool, just drinkin' with ya 
Way too young to be up in handcuffs 
Wasn’t tryna spend my life on the phone with ya 
Gotta keep it all 100 with ya 
The original me wouldn't *** with ya 
And I was beginning to *** with ya 

[Chorus: Dinah & (Normani) & (Ally) & All] 
Who said I was an angel? (But you was wrong, Oh, yeah) 
Who said I was an angel? (Oh, I'm no angel, when you look at me) 
When you look at me, what do you see? What do you see? 
Open your eyes, I'm more brilliant than you'll ever be 
Who said I was an angel? (Who said I was, an angel?) 

[Chorus: Normani + (Dinah) & (Lauren)] 
Who said I was an angel? 
(Didn't know the real me, I'm far from an angel) 
Who said I was an angel? Oh, yeah 
(Never took the time out, never had time to figure me out 
When you look at me) 
When you look at me, what do you see? (what do you see?) 
Open your eyes, I'm more brilliant than you'll ever be 
Who said I was an angel? (Who said I was a, an angel? Oh)
                        
                    |
