                        Bài hát: Style - Megan Nicole, Eppic

Midnight, 
You come and pick me up, no headlights 
Long drive,
 Could end in burning flames or paradise 
Fade into view, oh, it’s been a while since I have even heard from you (heard from you)
 I should just tell you to leave ’cause 
I Know exactly where it leads but 
I Watch us go ’round and ’round each time 
You got that James Dean daydream look in your eye 
And I got that red lip classic thing that you like
 And when we go crashing down, we come back every time
 ‘Cause we never go out of style
 We never go out of style
 You got that long hair, slicked back, white t-shirt
 And I got that good girl faith and a tight little skirt 
And when we go crashing down, we come back every time 
‘Cause we never go out of style 
We never go out of style. 
So it goes 
He can’t keep his wild eyes on the road 
Takes me home Lights are off, he’s taking off his coat I say,
 “I heard, oh, that you’ve been out and about with some other girl, some other girl.
” He says, “What you’ve heard is true but I Can’t stop thinking about you,” and I... 
I said, “I’ve been there too a few times.” 
You got that James Dean daydream look in your eye 
And I got that red lip classic thing that you like 
And when we go crashing down, we come back every time 
‘Cause we never go out of style
 We never go out of style 
You got that long hair, slicked back, white t-shirt 
And I got that good girl faith and a tight little skirt (tight little skirt) 
And when we go crashing down, we come back every time 
‘Cause we never go out of style 
We never go out of style 
Come on 
Come on
 Let’s run wild baby the city is ours
 Counting stars kissing beneath meteor showers
 Never in my wildest dreams and fantasies
 Daydreaming about the two of us being Kings and Queens
 We’re a match made in heaven, a dynamic duo 
Anything but ordinary, we’re destine 
The future looking good, like we bought a personal stylist 
I’m a bandit and stag myself one incredible diamond
 We got something that would last forever love at its finest 
My one and only wonder woman
 Laced up your lasso to pull me in
 When I was chasing after the baddest girls 
Forgive my stubbornness Splatter paint on the canvas, what a beautiful mess Shouting no regrets and harmony like a perfect duet
 We’ll never go out of style, we’re too fresh 
You got that James Dean daydream look in your eye
 And I got that red lip classic thing that you like
 And when we go crashing down, we come back every time
 ‘Cause we never go out of style 
We never go out of style
