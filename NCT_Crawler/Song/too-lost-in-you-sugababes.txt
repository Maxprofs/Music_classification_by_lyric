                        Bài hát: Too Lost In You - Sugababes

You look into my eyes
 I go out of my mind
 I can't see anything
 'Cause this love's got me blind I can't help myself
 I can't break the spell
 I can't even try I'm in over my head
 You got under my skin
 I got no strength at all
 In this state that I'm in And my knees are weak
 And my mouth can't speak
 Fell too far this time Baby, I'm too lost in you, caught in you
 Lost in everything about you
 So deep, I can't sleep, I can't think
 I just think about the things that you do
 I'm too lost in you Well, you whispered to me
 And I shiver inside
 You undo me and move me
 In ways undefined And you're all I see
 And you're all I need
 Help me baby
 Help me baby 'Cause I'm slippin' away
 Like the sand to the tide
 Falling into your arms
 Falling into your eyes If you get too near
 I might disappear
 I might lose my mind Baby, I'm too lost in you, caught in you
 Lost in everything about you
 So deep, I can't sleep, I can't think
 I just think about the things that you do
 I'm too lost in you I'm going in crazy in love for you baby
 I can't eat and I can't sleep
 I'm going down like a stone in the sea
 Yeah, no one can rescue me You're my baby
 Ohh, baby, baby Baby, I'm too lost in you, caught in you
 Lost in everything about you
 So deep, I can't sleep, I can't think
 I just think about the things that you do
 I'm too lost in you I'm lost in you, I'm lost in you
 I'm lost in everything about you
 So deep, I can't sleep, I can't think
 I just think about the things that you do
 I'm too lost in you
