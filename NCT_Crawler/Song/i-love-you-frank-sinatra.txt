                        I love you comes the April breeze
 I love you echo the hills
 I love you the golden dawn agrees
 As once more she sees daffodils It's spring again
 And birds on the wing again
 Start to sing again
 The old melody I love you
 That's song of songs
 And it all belongs
 To you and me It's spring again
 And birds on the wing again
 Start to sing again
 The old melody I love you
 That's the song of songs
 And it all belongs
 To you and me
                        
                    |
