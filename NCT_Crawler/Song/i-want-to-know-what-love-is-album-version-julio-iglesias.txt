                        Bài hát: I Want To Know What Love Is (Album Version) - Julio Iglesias

I gotta take a little time,
A little time to think things over
I better read between the lines,
In case I need it when I'm older

Now this mountain I must climb,
Feels like the world upon my shoulders
And through the clouds I see love shine,
It keeps me warm as life grows colder

In my life
There's been heartache and pain
I don't know
If I can face it again
Can't stop now,
I've travelled so far,
To change this lonely life

I want to know what love is,
I want you to show me
I want to feel what love is,
I know you can show me

I'm gonna take a little time,
A little time to look around me
I've got nowhere left to hide,
It looks like love has finally found me

In my life
There's been heartache and pain
I don't know
If I can face it again
Can't stop now,
I've travelled so far,
To change this lonely life

I want to know what love is,
I want you to show me
I want to feel what love is,
I know you can show me
I want to know what love is,
I know you can show me

I want to know what love is (I want to know)
I want you to show me
I want to feel what love is (I want to feel)
I know you can show me

(Show me, show me, show me...)

I want to know what love is,
I want you to show me
I want to feel what love is,
I know you can show me
                        
                    |
