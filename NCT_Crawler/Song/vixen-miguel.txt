R&B/Hip Hop/Rap|

                        Let's play a little game
 Just between you and I
 Obviously physical
 You gotta use your mind
 We can be cops and robbers
 Tarzan and Jane, Marilyn and Robert
 But either way the objective is the same
 To please and entertain You can be my vixen
 My bed'll be your stage
 You will get the spotlight all night
 Each and every time we play
 You will be my vixen
 As we improvise
 Delivering a captivating performance every time [Repeat] Why not be creative
 Pull out all the stops
 You can pick the scene
 If I can pick the props
 Do you prefer classroom or office
 Masquerade expert or novice
 We can play
 The objective is the same
 To please and entertain You will be my vixen
 My bed'll be your stage
 You will get the spotlight all night
 Each and every time we play
 You will be my vixen
 As we improvise
 Delivering a captivating performance every time [Repeat] Baby together we can't lose
 And I know you're always down for something new
 When we're making love girl let's put on a show
 Until the curtains close You will be my vixen
 My bed'll be your stage
 You will get the spotlight all night
 Each and every time we play
 You will be my vixen
 As we improvise
 Delivering a captivating performance every time [Repeat] You'll be my vixen You always said you wanted to become an actress
