                        Bottles on bottles, free shots for everybody
 Got enough for everybody, we crankin' up the volume
 Turn the music up louder, get loose and move your body
 Get loose and move your body, we crankin' up the volume Bottles on bottles, free shots for everybody
 Got enough for everybody, we crankin' up the volume
 Turn the music up louder, get loose and move your body
 Get loose and move your body, we crankin' up the volume Safe sex, and paychecks
 That's what it's all about, don't forget about
 Safe sex, and paychecks I bought the bar, I bought the ho' so a nigga can't tell me ***
 Just pour up the Ace, that cheap *** makes me sick
 I even let your bitch keep the gold bottle, gold pack, no Lifestyle
 Came to the club with my dogs, yeah we gon' ball 'til we fall
 OG purp on me, Steve Urkel have a young nigga geeked
 These girls, they DTF, that train got 'em feelin' their-self
 This nightlife *** ain't new to me
 Al the bad bitches get loose for me
 Say you do this every night, you gotta prove it to me
 Say you 'bout that life, you gotta prove it to me Shots, shots, now let's ***in' party
 Shots, shots, now let's ***in' party
 Shots, shots, now let's ***in' party
 Shots, shots, now let's ***in' party Bottles on bottles, free shots for everybody

 That's what it's all about, don't forget about
 Safe sex, and paychecks Rock star life, *** who don't like it
 Party all night, party all night
 I came here to have a good time
 Good smoke, good vibes, it's the good life
 Somehow I got the sack past security
 Now I'm jumpin' up and down off the Hennessy
 Now I'm jumpin' up and down off the Hennessy
 I'll probably wake up in the mornin' with no memory
 Double shots, no chaser
 We party hard in the AM
 Safe sex, no babies
 Everybody go crazy (Get wasted) Chug, chug, chug
 Don't stop 'til you get enough
 Don't stop 'til you get enough
 Don't stop 'til you get enough Chug, chug, chug
 Don't stop 'til you get enough
 Don't stop 'til you get enough
 Don't stop 'til you get enough Bottles on bottles, free shots for everybody
