                        Da-da-darkchild, baby
 Osinachi

 I see you over there looking like a millionaire
 Wind blowing through my hair making you wanna stare
 Come closer I want you, you can see it in my eyes
 I hope you're ready for the ride

 Zoom zoom zoom
 The honesty in my eyes got you hypnotized
 Zoom zoom zoom
 I'mma give you a look you gon' memorize

 Chorus:
 Jump in my painted windows, baby lets go
 My eyes look like a Picasso, let it all go
 Jump in my painted windows, wanna see my soul
 I'll show you, I can love you

 In the blink of an eye (Painted window)
 In the blink of an eye (My painted windows)
 In the blink of an eye (Painted window)
 In the blink of an eye (My painted windows)
 Ooh

 I got you so hot in a daze looking like a moron
 My hoods up gimme a jump baby time to get me started
 Be careful don't let go somebody might scare you go go
 You shouldn't let it come to this side

 Zoom zoom zoom ah
 The honesty in my eyes got you hypnotized
 Zoom zoom zoom ah
 I'mma give you a look you gon' memorize

 Jump in my painted windows, baby lets go
 My eyes look like a Picasso, let it all go
 Jump in my painted windows, wanna see my soul
 I'll show ya I can love ya

 In the blink of an eye (Painted window)
 In the blink of an eye (My painted windows)
 In the blink of an eye (Painted window)
 In the blink of an eye (My painted windows)
 Ooh

 Affection in my eyes while I watch the way you move
 Temptations no surprise I can't get enough of you

 Jump in my painted windows baby lets go
 My eyes look like a Picasso let it all go
 Jump in my painted windows Wanna see my soul
 I'll show you I can love you

 Jump in my painted windows baby lets go
 My eyes look like a Picasso let it all go
 Jump in my painted windows Wanna see my soul
 I'll show ya I can love ya

 In the blink of an eye (Painted window)
 In the blink of an eye (My painted windows)
 In the blink of an eye (Painted window)
 In the blink of an eye (My painted windows)
 Ooh

 Da-da-darkchild, baby
