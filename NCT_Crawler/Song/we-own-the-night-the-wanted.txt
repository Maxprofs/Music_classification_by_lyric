                        Bài hát: We Own The Night - The Wanted

May our hearts be full like our drinks tonight
May we sing and dance till we lose our minds
We are only young if we seize the night
Tonight we own the night
Tonight we own the night

La la la la la
La la la la la

When my time is over, lying in my grave
Written on my tombstone, I want it to say
This man was a legend, a legend of his time
When he was at a party, the party never died

Hey, Everybody's got a dream so what do you say
Are we making history?

May our hearts be full like our drinks tonight
May we sing and dance till we lose our minds
We are only young if we seize the night
Tonight we own the night
Tonight we own the night

La la la la la
La la la la la

For tonight im famous, for tonight im king
And I will be remembered, for centuries of sand
This man was a hero, a hero of the night
When he was at a party, the party never died

Hey, I'm a little drunk, but I got something to say

May our hearts be full like our drinks tonight
May we sing and dance till we lose our minds
We are only young if we seize the night
Tonight we own the night
Tonight we own the night

And let us wake up in studded strangers bed
Let the drinks comes in until nothing left
And this night my friends we will not forget
Tonight we own the night
Tonight we own the night

May our hearts be full like our drinks tonight
May we sing and dance till we lose our minds
We are only young if we seize the night
Tonight we own the night
Tonight we own the night.
