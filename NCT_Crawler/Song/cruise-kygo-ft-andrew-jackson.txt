                        Bài hát: Cruise - Kygo, Andrew Jackson

[Verse 1]
Sunset rolling, summer stolen
We'll never be so young
Checking wishes, shock on kisses
Tripping off my tongue

[Pre-Chorus]
See I'm giving up the fire
They said it was too late for us
But we are coming back to life
A little every time we touch
I wanna run away tonight
I feel like I'm in love with you
Tomorrow we can face the lie
Right now, let's just

[Chorus]
Cruise
Cruise
Cruise
Cruise

[Verse 2]
Open windows, all four fingers
Dancing on the wind
My heart's thumping, goosebumping
All over my skin

[Pre-Chorus]
See I'm giving up the fight
They said it was too late for us
But we are coming back to life
A little every time we touch
I wanna run away tonight
I feel like I'm in love with you
Tomorrow we can face the lie
Right now, let's just

[Chorus]
Cruise
Cruise
Cruise
Cruise

Cruise
Cruise
Cruise
Cruise
Cruise
                        
                    |
