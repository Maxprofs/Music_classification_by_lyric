                        Bài hát: Pretty Hurts - Beyonce

Mr. third world, your first question 
What is your aspiration in life? 
Oh, my aspiration in life 
Would be to be happy 

Mama said, you're a pretty girl 
What's in your head, it doesn't matter 
Brush your hair, fix your teeth 
What you wear is all that matters 
Just another stage, pageant the pain away 
This time I'm gonna take the crown 
Without falling down, down 

Pretty hurts, shine the light on whatever's worse 
Perfection is a disease of a nation, pretty hurts, pretty hurts 
Pretty hurts, shine the light on whatever's worse 
Trying to fix something but you can't fix what you can't see 
It's the soul that needs the surgery 

Blonder hair, flat chest 
TV says bigger is better 
South beach, sugar free 
Vogue says thinner is better 
Just another stage 
Pageant the pain away 
This time I'm gonna take the crown 
Without falling down, down, down 

Pretty hurts, shine the light on whatever's worse 
Perfection is a disease of a nation, pretty hurts, pretty hurts (Pretty hurts) 
Pretty hurts (pretty hurts), shine the light on whatever's worse 
Trying to fix something but you can't fix what you can't see 
It's the soul that needs the surgery 

Ain't got no doctor, no computer can take the pain away 
The pain's inside and nobody frees you from your body 
It's the soul, it's the soul that needs surgery 
It's my soul that needs surgery 

Plastic smiles and denial can only take you so far 
And you break when the paper sign leaves you in the dark 
You left a shattered mirror and the shards of a beautiful girl 

Pretty hurts, shine the light on whatever's worse (pretty hurts) 
Perfection is a disease of a nation, pretty hurts, pretty hurts 
Pretty hurts, shine the light on whatever's worse 
Trying to fix something but you can't fix what you can't see 
It's the soul that needs the surgery 

When you're alone all by yourself 
And you're lying in your bed 
Reflection stares right into you 
Are you happy with yourself 
It's just a way to masquerade 
The illusion that's been shed 
Are you happy with yourself? 
Are you happy with yourself?, yes
                        
                    |
