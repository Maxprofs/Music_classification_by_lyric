                        Bài hát: Hero - Luciano Pavarotti, Mariah Carey

Mariah:
This is for you, I love you, thank you.

Hmm
There's a hero
If you look inside your heart
You don't have to be afraid
Of what you are
There's an answer
If you reach into your soul
And the sorrow that you know
Will melt away, hey

And then a hero comes along
With the strength to carry on
And you cast your fears aside
'Cause you know you can survive
So when you feel like hope is gone
Look inside you and be strong
And you'll finally see the truth
That a hero lies in you

LP:
Quante volte va
Anche se tu non lo vuoi
Ogni piccola sconfitta sembra sia
Un deserto
Di rinunce e grande ostilit ̈¤
E vuoi dimenticare la realt ̈¤

La luce dentro te
Si accende sai perch ̈¦
Non sei mai solo nei momenti in cui
Ti sembra che nessuno al mondo
Creda in te
Non perderti perch ̈¦
La luce tua si accender ̈¤
E vedrai che il buio
In quel momento svanir ̈¤

Mariah:
Oh oooh
Lord knows (Lord knows)
Dreams are hard to follow
But don't let anyone
Tear them away, yeah yeah
(Pavarotti: La luce dentro te)
Just hold on
And there will be tomorrow
And in time
You'll find the way (you'll find the way)

LP & Mariah:
La luce dentro te - And then a hero comes along
Si accende sai perch ̈¦ - With the strength to carry on
Non sei mai solo nei momenti in cui - And you cast your fears aside
Ti sembra che nessuno al mondo - 'Cause you know you can survive
Creda in te - So when you feel like hope is gone
Non perderti perch ̈¦ - Look inside you and be strong
La luce tua si accender ̈¤ e vedrai che il buio - And you'll finally see the truth
In quel momento svanir ̈¤ - That a hero lies in you

That a hero lies in you
La luce dentro te
Doo
That a hero lies in
You

Luciano Pavarotti's lyrics translation

How many times
Also if you don't want it
Every little loss seems like
A desert
Of renunciation and big hostility
And you want to forget about reality

The light inside yourself
It turns on and you know why
You're never alone in those moment when
You feel like nobody in the world
Believes in you
Don't lose yourself because
Your light will bright
And you'll see the darkness
In that moment it will vanish

The light inside yourself
