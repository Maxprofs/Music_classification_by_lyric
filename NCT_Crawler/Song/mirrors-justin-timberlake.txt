                        Bài hát: Mirrors - Justin Timberlake

[Verse 1]
Aren't you somethin' to admire
Cause your shine is somethin' like a mirror
And I can't help but notice
You reflect in this heart of mine
If you ever feel alone and
The glare makes me hard to find
Just know that I'm always
Peering out on the other side

[Pre-Hook]
Cau se with your hand in my hand and a pocket full of soap
I can tell you there's no place we couldn't go
Just put your hand on the past
I'm here tryin' to pull you through
You just gotta be strong

[Hook 1]
Cause I don't wanna lose you now
I'm lookin' right at the other half of me
The biggest scene is set in my heart
There's a space, but now you're home
Show me how to fight for now
And I'll tell you, baby, it was easy
Comin' back into you once I figured it out
You were right here all along
It's like you're my mirror
My mirror staring back at me
I couldn't get any bigger
With anyone else beside me
And now it's clear as this promise
That we're making
Two reflections into one
Cause it's like you're my mirror
My mirror staring back at me, staring back at me

[Verse 2]
Aren't you somethin', an original
Cause it doesn't seem really as simple
And I can't help but stare, cause
I see truth somewhere in your eyes
I can't ever change without you
You reflect me, I love that about you
And if I could, I
Would look at us all the time

[Pre-Hook]

[H ook]

[Break]
Yester day is history
Tomorrow's a mystery
I can see you lookin' back at me
Keep your eyes on me
Baby, keep your eyes on me

[Hook]

[Hook 2] x10
You are you are the love of my life

[Verse 3]
Baby, you're the inspiration for this precious song
And I just wanna see your face light up since you put me on
So now I say goodbye to the old me, it's already gone
And I can't wait wait wait wait wait to get you home
Just to let you know, you are

[Hook 2] x8

[Verse 4]
Girl you're my reflection, all I see is you
My reflection, in everything I do
You're my reflection and all I see is you
My reflection, in everything I do

[Hook 2] x16
