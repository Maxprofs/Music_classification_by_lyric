                        Bài hát: Spiritual - Katy Perry

Magic, or one, or mystery
All of you trying to work on me
I would surrender myself
Holy how, and heaven high
You will open up my heart
And I'm finally here

This is spiritual, under your spell
For not me no, the way you make me feel
Like an angel, oh, at blow
Like a feather, you make me float

Love you crazy kite on your left
Lost in sweet ectasy
Under nirvana finally

Magic, or one, or mystery
All of you trying to work on me
I would surrender myself
Holy how, and heaven high
You will open up my heart
And I'm finally here
                        
                    |
