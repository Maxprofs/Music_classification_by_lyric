                        LOVE STORY
The Who

 ***

Where do I begin
To tell the story of how great a love can be
The sweet love story that is older than the sea
The simple truth about the love she brings to me
Where do I start

With her first hello she gave a meaning
To this empty world of mine
There'd never be another love another time
She came into my life and made the living fine
She fills my heart
She fills my heart with very special things
With angel songs , with wild imaginings 
She fills my soul
With so much love that anywhere I go
I'm never lonely with her along
Who could be lonely
I reach for her hand it's always there

How long does it last
Can love be measured be the hours in a day
I have no answers now but this much I can say
I know I'll need her still the stars all burn away
And she'll be there
