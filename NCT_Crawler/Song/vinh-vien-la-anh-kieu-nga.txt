                        Bài hát: Vĩnh Viễn Là Anh - Kiều Nga

Look into my eyes and tell me what you see
If this meant to show one say it's mystery
Since the day I met you baby I can feel
Deep inside my heart I know it's real
You have turned my dreams into reality
Baby not my hunter, you're sweet melody
It's the same old feeling baby, it's so real
Deep inside my heart I know it's real

Say you'll never, never, never go away
Say you'll never, never, never never go away

Yesterday my life was just a history
Now I feel like mastering my destiny
It's the same old feeling baby, it's so real
Deep inside my heart I know it's real

Say you'll never, never, never go away
Say you'll never, never, never never go away
                        
                    |
