                        Bài hát: Count Me In(From "Liv & Maddie"/ Music from the TV Series) - Dove Cameron

Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh 

If I'm the sun then you're the moon 
If you're the words then I'm the tune 
Yeah 
If you're the heart then I'm the beat 
Somehow together we're complete 
Yeah 

There are times my world is crumbling and the rain is crashing down 
But everywhere you are the sun comes out 

Even when you're gone 
I feel you close 
You'll always be the one 
I love the most 
You're in my heart, on my mind, 
You are underneath my skin 
And anywhere anytime that you need anything 
Count me in 
Oh oh oh oh oh oh 
Count me in yeah yeah 

I don't need to say a word, no 
'Cause you know when I'm happy and when I'm hurt 
We're close as pages in a book 
'Cause you make me feel better with just one look 

There are times my world is crumbling and the rain is crashing down 
But everywhere you are the sun comes out 

Even when you're gone 
I feel you close 
You'll always be the one 
I love the most 
You're in my heart, on my mind, 
You are underneath my skin 
And anywhere anytime that you need anything 
Count me in oh oh oh oh oh oh 
Count me in yeah yeah 

'Cause we're two halves of the same new heart that beats to our own drum 
You're the shadow always by my side, 
One that sometimes knows me better than I know myself 
And I wish that you were here with me tonight 

Even when you're gone 
I feel you close 
You'll always be the one 
I love the most (I love the most) 
You're in my heart, on my mind, 
You are underneath my skin 
And anywhere anytime that you need anything 
Count me in oh oh oh oh oh oh 
Count me in yeah yeah oh oh oh oh 
Count me in oh oh oh oh 
Count me in
