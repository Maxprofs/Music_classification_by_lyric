                        [Nicki Minaj - Chorus]
 You see right through me
 How do you do that sh-t
 How do you do that sh-t
 How do you do that sh-t
 How do you, how do you, how do you, how do you, how do you

 [Nicki Minaj - Verse 1]
 You let me win, you let me ride
 You let me rock, you let me slide
 And when they looking you let me hide
 Defend my honor, protect my pride
 The good advice I always hated
 But looking back it made me greater
 You always told me forget the haters
 Just get my money, just get my weight up
 Know when I'm lying, know when I'm crying
 It's like you got it down to a science
 Why am I trying, no you aint lying
 I tried to fight it, back with defiance
 You make me laugh, you make hoarse from yelling at you
 At gettin' at you, pickin' up dishes and throwing them at you
 Why are you speaking when no-one asks you

 [Nicki Minaj - Chorus](2x)
 You see right through me
 How do you do that sh-t
 How do you do that sh-t
 How do you do that sh-t
 How do you, how do yo, how do yo, how do yo, how do yo

 [Nicki Minaj - Verse 2]
 What are we doing
 Could you see through me
 Cause you say Nicki and I say "who me"
 You say "no you" and I say "screw you"
 Then you start dressing, and you start leaving
 And I start crying and I start screaming
 The heavy breathing but what's the reason
 Always get the reaction you wanted
 I'm actually frontin', I'm asking you something
 Yo, answer this question, class is in session
 Tired of letting passing progression
 Control my mind, capture my soul
 Ok you're right, just let it go
 Okay you got it, it's in the can
 Before I played it, you knew my hand
 You can turn a free throw to a goal
 N-gga got the peep hole to my soul

 [Nicki Minaj - Chorus](2x)
 You see right through me
 How do you do that sh-t
 How do you do that sh-t
 How do you do that sh-t
 How do you, how do yo, how do yo, how do yo, how do yo

 [Nicki Minaj - Bridge]
 Stop... Stop
 Won't you just stop looking through me
 Cause I can't take it
 No I can't take it

 [Nicki Minaj - Chorus]
 You see right through me
 How do you do that sh-t
 How do you do that sh-t
 How do you do that sh-t
 How do you, how do yo, how do yo, how do yo, how do yo

 You see right through me
 You see right through me baby
 You see right through me
 How do you (do that)
 How do you (do that)
 How do you (do that)
