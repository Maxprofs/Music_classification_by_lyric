                        Bài hát: Solace - Enya

What can I do to comfort you?
Don't hide away in solitude

What can I say to show the way?
Let tears become a soft rain

Why do you hide the loss inside?
The love you feel is in your eyes.

Why do you go upon this road
When you can find your way home?
                        
                    |
