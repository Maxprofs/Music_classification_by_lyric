                        The way you smile, the way you taste
You know I have an appetite for sexy things
All you do is look at me, it's a disgrace
What's runnin' through my mind is you up in my face

Your voice is like music to my ears
Whisper softly and the world disappears
Take me higher and just wipe away my fears
When you're with me, oh boy, it's my heartbeat that I hear

Ooh, ooh baby, touch me and I come alive
I can feel you on my lips, I can feel you deep inside
Ooh, ooh baby, in your arms I finally breathe
Wrap me up in all your love, that's the oxygen I need, yeah

You're fillin' me up, you're fillin' me up
You're fillin' me up, you're fillin' me up
You're fillin' me up, you're fillin' me up with your love

The more you move, the more I tense
It's like you got me hypnotized, I'm in a trance
Your jersey fits, it's right at home between my hands
And now I hope you know that I'm your biggest fan, yeah, yeah

Your voice is like music to my ears
Whisper softly and the world disappears
Take me higher and just wipe away my fears
When you're with me, oh boy, it's my heartbeat that I hear

Ooh, ooh baby, touch me and I come alive
I can feel you on my lips, I can feel you deep inside
Ooh, ooh baby, in your arms I finally breathe
Wrap me up in all your love, that's the oxygen I need, yeah

You're fillin' me up, you're fillin' me up
You're fillin' me up, you're fillin' me up
You're fillin' me up, you're fillin' me up with your love

You got somethin' that I really want and
Come here, oh we don't even have to talk and
Lay back and let me tell you what I'm thinkin'
'Cause I like you, 'cause I like you

Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby

Ooh, ooh baby, touch me and I come alive
I can feel you on my lips, I can feel you deep inside
Ooh, ooh baby, in your arms I finally breathe
Wrap me up in all your love, that's the oxygen I need, yeah

Ooh, ooh baby, touch me and I come alive
I can feel you on my lips, I can feel you deep inside
Ooh, ooh baby, in your arms I finally breathe
Wrap me up in all your love, that's the oxygen I need, yeah

Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
