                        Cry just a little - Avantasia.

A heart out of affection, a night at the masquerade 
You won some and you're lonesome 
As the spotlight fades. 
Going forth pretending destination is at hand. 
When she's crying just a little, just for me 

I've seen them set off to the promised land. 
Escaping from the hurtings 
They don't understand. 
A sense of satisfaction 
On account of pristine tears. 
She's crying just a little more, just like you. 

Why don't you cry, cry a little over me? 
Why don't you lie? 
Can't you tell me that I am hard to deny? 
Can't she see what I am going through? 
Cry just a little for me. 
Oh girl, a little for me. 

Afraid to give away what you keep inside. 
There's a ghost in your mirror 
Every lonesome night. 
And those nights are getting colder. 
And your heart's a frozen wound. 
Don't you wonder who'll be there, when you awake? 

Why don't you cry, cry a little over me? 
Why don't you lie? 
Can't you tell me that I am hard to deny? 
Can't she see what I am going through? 
Cry just a little for me. 
Oh girl, a little for me. 

Why don't you cry, cry a little over me? 
Why don't you lie? 
Can't you tell me that I am hard to deny? 
Can't she see what I am going through? 
Cry just a little for me! 
Oh cry, a little for me...
