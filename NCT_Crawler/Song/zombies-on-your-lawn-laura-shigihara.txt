                        (Sunflower)
Sunflower!

...1, 2, 3, 4!
There's a zombie on your lawn...
There's a zombie on your lawn...
There's a zombie on your lawn...
We don't want zombies on the lawn...

I know your type: tall, dark and dead
You wanna bite all the petals of my head 
And then eat the brain of the one who planted me here.

(House owner)
Nooooooo......

(Sunflower)
I'm just a sunflower but see
Me power an entire infantry.
You like the taste of brain 
We don't want zombies.
Ahhhhhhhh...

(Football zombie)
I use to play football.
(Football...)

(Road cone zombie)
Road cone protect my head.
(My head...)

(Screen-door zombie)
I have a screen-door shield. 
(Door shield..)

(Zombies)
We are the UNDEAD!

(Sunflower)
There's a zombie on your lawn...
There's a zombie on your lawn...
There's a zombie on your lawn...
We don't want zombies on the lawn...

I think is time to reevaluate
I know you have a lot of food on your plate
Brain are quiet rich in cholesterol

You are all dead so it doesn't matter
Instead we use this solar power
To make the lawn defense on any hour...

(Miner zombie)
I like your tricycle.
(Cycle...)

(Regular zombie with a slice of butter on the head) 
There's butter on my head!
(My head..)

(Dolphin zombie)
I... gonna... eat... your brain!
(B-rain)

(Zombies)
We are the UNDEAD!
