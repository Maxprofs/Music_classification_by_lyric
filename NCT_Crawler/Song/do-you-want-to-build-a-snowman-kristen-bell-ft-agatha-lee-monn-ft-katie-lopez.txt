                        Bài hát: Do You Want To Build A Snowman? - Kristen Bell, Agatha Lee Monn, Katie Lopez

Elsa?
Do you wanna build a snow man?
Come on let's go and play
I never see you anymore
Come out the door
It's like you've gone away
We used to be best buddies
And now we're not
I wish you would tell me why
Do you wanna build a snowman
It doesn't have to be a snowman (Go away Anna)
Ok bye

Do you wanna build a snowman?
Or ride a bike around the halls?
I think some company's overdue
I've started talking to the pictures on the walls (hanging there Joan)
It gets a little lonely
All these empty rooms
Just watching the hours tick by

Elsa?
Please I know you're in there
People are asking where you've been
They say have courage, and I'm trying to
I'm right out here for you, just let me in
We only have each other, just you and me
What are we gonna do?
Do you wanna build a snowman?
                        
                    |
