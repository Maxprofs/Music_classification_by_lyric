                        Bài hát: Heart Attack - Demi Lovato

Puttin’ my defences up 
‘Cause I don’t wanna fall in love 
If I ever did that 
I think I’d have a heart attack 

Never put my love out on the line 
Never said 'yes' to the right guy 
Never had trouble getting what I want 
But when it comes to you, I’m never good enough 
When I don’t care 
I can play ‘em like a Ken doll 
Won’t wash my hair 
Then make 'em bounce like a basketball 

But you make me wanna act like a girl 
Paint my nails and wear high heels 
Yeah, it’s you, make me so nervous 
That I just can’t hold your hand 

You make me glow, but I cover up 
Won’t let it show, so I’m 
Puttin’ my defences up 
Cause I don’t wanna fall in love 
If I ever did that 
I think I’d have a heart attack (x3) 

Never break a sweat for the other guys 
When ya come around, I get paralyzed 
And everytime I try to be myself 
It comes out wrong like a cry for help 
It’s just not fair 
Pain’s more trouble than it all is worth 
I gasp for air 
It feels so good, but you know it hurts 

But you make me wanna act like a girl 
Paint my nails and wear perfume 
For you, make me so nervous 
That I just can’t hold your hand 

You make me glow, but I cover up 
Won’t let it show, so I’m 
Puttin’ my defences up 
Cause I don’t wanna fall in love 
If I ever did that 
I think I’d have a heart attack (x3) 

The feelings I lost in my love 
They’re burning, I’d rather be numb 
And there’s no one else to blame 
So scared I take off and I run 
I’m flying too close to the sun 
And I’m burst into flames 

You make me glow, but I cover up 
Won’t let it show, so I’m 
Puttin’ my defences up 
‘Cause I don’t wanna fall in love 
If I ever did that 
I think I’d have a heart attack (x5)
