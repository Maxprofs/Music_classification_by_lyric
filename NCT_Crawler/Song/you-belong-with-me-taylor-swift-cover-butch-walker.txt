                        Bài hát: You Belong With Me (Taylor Swift Cover) - Butch Walker

You're on the phone with your boyfriend, he's upset
He's going off about something that you said
He doesn't get your humor like I do
I'm at a bar, it's a typical Tuesday night
I'm listening to the kind of music nobody likes
He'll never know your story like I do

He wears izods, I wear t-shirts
He's team captain and I'm on the bleachers
Dreaming about the day when you wake up and find
That what you're looking for, was here the whole time

And you can see that I'm the one who understands you
Been here all along so why can't you see-
You belong with me-
You belong with me

Walking the streets with you and your cut off jeans
Can't help thinking this is how it ought to be
Laughing on a park bench thinking to myself, hey isn't this easy
You got a smile that can light up this whole town
I haven't seen it in a while, since he brought you down
You say you're fine, I know you better than that
Hey what you doing with a guy like that?

And he wears high heals, I wear sneakers
Coz he's team captain and I'm on the bleachers
Dreaming about the day when you wake up and find
That what you're looking for, was here the whole time

And you can see that I'm the one who understands you
Been here all along so why can't you see-
You belong with me-
Standing by, just waiting at your back door
All the time how could you not know baby
You belong with me-
You belong with me

Oh I remember driving to your house in the middle of the night
I'm the one who makes you laugh when you know you're about to cry
I know all your favorite songs, and you tell me about your dreams
I think I know where you belong, I think you know its with me-

If you could see that I'm the one who understands you
Been here all along so why can't you see-
You belong with me-
Standing by, just waiting at your back door
All this time how could you not know baby
You belong with me-
You belong with me
You belong with me
You belong with me
You belong with me
You belong with me
