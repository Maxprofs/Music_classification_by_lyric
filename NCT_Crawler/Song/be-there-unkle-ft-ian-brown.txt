                        You don't wanna go there
 Let me lead you by the hand
 You don't wanna be there
 Over the sea and onto land As I look into your eyes
 I pay no mind, I found the way
 To get inside you
 I'd give you peace of mind I might see you falling
 I might see you falling
 I might see you falling, beautiful
 This time I don't see you falling
 I don't see you falling
 I don't see you falling, beautiful
 Sometime You don't wanna go there
 Let me lead you by the hand
 You don't wanna be there
 Over the sea and onto land As I look into your eyes
 I pay no mind, I found the way
 To get inside you
 I'd give you peace of mind I might see you falling
 I might see you falling
 I might see you falling, beautiful
 This time I don't see you falling
 I don't see you falling
 I don't see you falling, beautiful
 Sometime Here I am
 And there you are
 Falling, falling, falling
 Falling, falling, falling I might see you falling
 I might see you falling
 I might see you falling, beautiful
 This time I don't see you falling
 I don't see you falling
 I don't see you falling, beautiful
 Sometime I might see you falling
 I might see you falling
 I might see you falling, beautiful
 This time I don't see you falling
 I don't see you falling
 I don't see you falling, beautiful
 Sometime How do you feel?
 How do you feel? I don't see you falling
 I don't see you falling Corrupt, a plea for free will
 An irresponsible horror show
 It has been suggested
 That this contradictory
