                        Bài hát: Nocturne - Secret Garden

Now let the day
Just slip away
So the dark night
May watch over you
Nocturne

Though darkness lay
It will give way
When the dark night
Delivers the day

Now let the day just slip away
so the dark night may watch over you
Velvet blue. Silent true.
It embraces your heart and your soul.
Nocturne

Never cry, never sigh,
You don’t have to wonder why
Always be. Always see.
come and dream the night with me.
Nocturne

Have no fear when the night draws near
and fills you with dreams and desires
Like a child asleep so warm so deep
You will find me there waiting for you
Nocturne

We’ll fly, claim the sky,
You don’t have to wonder why
Always be. Always see.
come and dream the night with me!
Nocturne

Now the darkness lay, it will give way
When the dark night delivers the day,
Nocturne.
