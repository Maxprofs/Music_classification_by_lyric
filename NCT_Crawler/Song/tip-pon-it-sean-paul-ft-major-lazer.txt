[Intro]
Gyal

[Verse 1]
With a body like that
When you Snapchat me, girl, sey me haffi screenshot
Some may call it hopscotch, well it's only gyal hot
She a bubble like zoob, got that real bubble butt
Check ya iPhone fi di iMessages
Send me, hopping out the exits
When mi get inside Magnum, ready ready mix
So know tonight, your business get fixed, gyal

[Chorus]
Mi love all your whining, bubble gyal
When you go pon your toe and tip on it
Body look tight and right, gyal
When you cream, drop the ting and drip on it
Treat me like a opponent, opponent
Pon di desktop then you double pic on it
Mi love you, boom fix pon it
Do all kind tricks pon it
Wind gyal
Same way
Wind gyal
Mi no come here fi no game play
Wind gyal
Same way
Wind gyal
Do all kind tricks pon it
                        
                    |
