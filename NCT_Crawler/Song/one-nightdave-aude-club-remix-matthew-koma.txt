                        You think you're the new sexy
 In a white Mercedez at bends me to the grave
 You make casual messy
 And all the Cheerios posses you like a slave, you're custom made
 Don't take this swing, for more than it is
 It's one night one night one night

 Chew my love, under your tongue, like it's your bubble gum
 You're blowing bubbles till the taste is gone
 You're coming over for the night
 One night one night one night
 Chew my love, under your tongue, like it's your bubble gum
 Just spit me out when it becomes more than fun
 Cause I'm coming over for the night
 One night one night one night

 Conversation is valient
 Baby you're too digital
 Levitate the physical
 But keep me under your ceiling
 Cause your concrete is cheaper, no, crumbling like grease I know
 Don't take this swing, for more than it is
 It's one night one night one night

 Chew my love, under your tongue, like it's your bubble gum
 You're blowing bubbles till the taste is gone
 You're coming over for the night
 One night one night one night
 Chew my love, under your tongue, like it's your bubble gum
 Just spit me out when it becomes more than fun
 Cause I'm coming over for the night
 One night one night one night

 And now I'll pull you in close
 It's a sweet and sour high
 When you promise not to try
 You've a promise that I lie
 We can drink a punch for this one last time
 Just one more last time

 Chew my love, under your tongue, like it's your bubble gum
 You're blowing bubbles till the taste is gone
 You're coming over for the night
 One night one night one night
 Chew my love, under your tongue, like it's your bubble gum
 Just spit me out when it becomes more than fun
 Cause I'm coming over for the night
 One night one night one night

 Just spit me out when it becomes more than fun
