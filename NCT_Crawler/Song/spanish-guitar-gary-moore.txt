                        Bài hát: Spanish Guitar - Gary Moore, Phil Lynott

As I sit here and play
My spanish guitar
Underneath the stars,
It passes the time away.

Each note I play
Is a memory of Spain,
The melodies they take me
Back there again.

So as I sit here and play
On my old spanish guitar,
Each note I play
Just sails away.
And it brings me closer
To that spanish senorita.
Oh, she's so far away.

As I sit here and play
Underneath the stars,
It passes the time away
And brings me closer
To my spanish holiday.
