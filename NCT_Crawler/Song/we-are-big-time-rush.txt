                        Thinking, we don't want to get caught up in over thinking
 We only got tonight
 Moments, we gotta keep on living for these moments,
 'Cause this is our time Life's too short to sit and wait
 For love to come our way
 Light it up like fireworks
 I wanna hear you say We are we are We are alive, and we have the light shining down
 We are we are, we are the reckless
 You can hear us drowning of the sound
 We are we are, young and dumb
 Always chasing something
 We are we are, hearts like drums
 You can hear us coming
 We are we are Chances, you know there's nothing wrong with taking chances
 We put it on the line
 Oh, someday I know we're gonna be somebody someday
 Only gotta try Life's too short to sit and wait
 For love to come our way
 Light it up like fireworks
 I wanna hear you say We are alive, and we have the light shining down
 We are we are, we are the reckless
 You can hear us drowning of the sound
 We are we are, young and dumb
 Always chasing something
 We are we are, hearts like drums
 You can hear us coming
 We are we are We are alive, and we have the light shining down
 We are we are, we are the reckless
 You can hear us drowning of the sound
 We are we are, young and dumb
 Always chasing something
 We are we are, hearts like drums
 You can hear us coming
 We are we are
