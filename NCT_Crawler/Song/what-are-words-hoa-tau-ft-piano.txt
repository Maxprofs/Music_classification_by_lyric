                        Bài hát: What Are Words - Hòa Tấu, Piano

Anywhere you are, I am near 
Anywhere you go, I'll be there 
Anytime you whisper my name 
You'll see 

How every single promise I'll keep 
'Cause what kind of guy would I be 
If I was to leave 
When you need me most? 

What are words 
If you really don't mean them when you say them? 
What are words 
If they're only for good times, then they're done? 

When it's love 
Yeah, you say them out loud 
Those words, they never go away 
They live on, even when we're gone 

And I know an angel was sent 
Just for me and I know I'm meant 
To be where I am 
And I'm gonna be 

Standing right beside her tonight 
And I'm gonna be by your side 
I would never leave 
When she needs me most 

What are words 
If you really don't mean them when you say them? 
What are words 
If they're only for good times, then they're done? 

When it's love 
Yeah, you say them out loud 
Those words, they never go away 
They live on, even when we're gone 

Anywhere you are, I am near 
Anywhere you go, I'll be there 
And I'm gonna be here 
Forever more 

Every single promise I keep 
'Cause what kind of guy would I be 
If I was to leave 
When you need me most? 

I'm forever keeping my angel close
                        
                    |
