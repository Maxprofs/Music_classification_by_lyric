                        [Verse 1]
We've got a bit of love/hate
You take me to the edge then you hit the breaks
I say it's over one day,
But then I'm crawling back begging you to stay
We make up then we break up all the time

I'll say that I hate a song, then you'll go request it the whole night long
Some people say it's so wrong but even when we fight,
Girl, you turn me on
We make up then we break up all the time

[Chorus]
We're like na na na
Then we're like yeah yeah yeah
Always like na na na
Then we're like yeah yeah yeah

No we can't make up our minds
Cause when we think we've got it right
We go na na na

[Verse 2]
You wanna party too late
But when I do the same all you do is complain
You know that it drives me insane
But when I get with you girl you make it okay
We make up then we break up all the time

[Chorus]
We're like na na na
Then we're like yeah yeah yeah
Always like na na na
Then we're like yeah yeah yeah

No we can't make up our minds
Cause when we think we've got it right
We go na na na na

[Break]

[Chorus]
We're like na na na
Then we're like yeah yeah yeah
Always like na na na
Then we're like yeah yeah yeah

We're like na na na
Then we're like yeah yeah yeah
Always like na na na
Then we're like yeah yeah yeah

No we can't make up our minds
Cause when we think we've got it right
We go na na na na
                        
                    |
