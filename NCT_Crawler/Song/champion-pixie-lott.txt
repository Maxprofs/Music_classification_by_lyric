                        I fight for love
 I'll prove to you I've got the moves
 Like no one else Boy, she's a fool (she's a fool)
 She's telling lies, talking jaw
 She can go to hell, c'mon through that veil If she's Apollo Creed, then I'm Rocky Balboa
 When I'm down on my knees
 That's when baby, I'll show ya
 I'll fight for your heart, I'll be your champion, champion You're the prize, you sting me though
 You're floating like a butterfly
 But I feel alive You know why
 I love you even more than any other guy
 For you I'd die If she's Apollo Creed, I'll be Rocky Balboa
 When I'm down on my knees
 That's when baby, I'll show ya
 I'll fight for your heart, I'll be your champion I'm gonna rumble in the jungle
 Be as sweet as vanilla
 Prove my love to you, in this twelve round thriller
 I'll fight for your heart, I'll be your champion, champion I'm gonna use my lips, use my hips
 Wrap you 'round my fingertips
 Just to prove I love you, baby If she's Apollo Creed, I'll be Rocky Balboa
 When I'm down on my knees
 That's when baby, I'll show ya
 I'll fight for your heart, I'll be your champion
 I'll be your champion I'll fight for your heart, I'll be your champion yeah I'm gonna rumble in the jungle
 Be as sweet as vanilla
 Prove my love to you, in this twelve round thriller
 Fight for your heart, I'll be your champion, champion
