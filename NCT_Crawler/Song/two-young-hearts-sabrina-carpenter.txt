                        It's a narrow line I'm walkin'
 Better watch myself
 'Cause we got everybody talkin'
 And I can hear 'em say Maybe in another lifetime
 Maybe when you're older
 What they don't know is
 I've already made up my mind (My mind)
 And yes I know what love is 'Cause we are two old souls,
 With two young hearts
 We can run, I will follow you to the end of the earth
 Where we can see forever,
 They can never tear us apart
 Two old souls,
 With two young hearts
 Two young hearts They say we're too young
 I could lie awake in darkness
 Oh just to dream of you
 And you could lay your head on my chest
 Yeah, just like you always do Maybe in another lifetime
 Maybe when we're older
 At least we know that
 We've already made up our minds
 And yes we know what love is 'Cause we are two old souls,
 With two young hearts
 We can run, I will follow you to the end of the earth
 Where we can see forever,
 They can never tear us apart
 Two old souls,
 With two young hearts
 Two young hearts We're gonna keep on runnin'
 Runnin' for all that we are
 We want it all or nothing
 We knew it right from the start
 We are apart of something
 Something as old as time, time, time 'Cause we are two old souls
 With two young hearts
 We can run, I will follow you to the end of the earth
 Where we can see forever,
 They can never tear us apart
 Two old souls,
 With two young hearts
 Two young hearts You're never too young
