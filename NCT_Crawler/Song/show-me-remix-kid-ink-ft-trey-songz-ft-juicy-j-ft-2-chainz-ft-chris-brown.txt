                        Bài hát: Show Me (Remix) - Kid Ink, Trey Songz, Juicy J, 2 Chainz, Chris Brown

Oooh baby
I said baby
Yeah
Mustard on the beat, ho
Baby let me put your panties to the side
Imma make you feel alright
Imma give you what you need quick, baby, it's the remix

[Hook: Chris Brown & Trey Songz]
Mami you remind me of something (baby you me remind me)
But I don’t know what it is (I don't even know)
Cause you remind me of something (girl you gotta show me)
Girl you gotta show me, yeah (alright)
You remind me of something (baby you remind me)
But I don't know what it is right now (don't even know)
Cause you remind me of something
Girl you gotta show me

[Verse 1: Kid Ink]
Uh, on the real know, west coast back like '94
Just picture me rolling in my own lane
Should of listened to the hype though, hold that
And show me something, DJ ain't playing nothing but Mustard
Catch up to the bandwagon *** us
It's Friday, I'm feeling like the old Chris Tucker
And we go for the record
Trying to go platinum and add a couple karats
Being low key kinda hard with the cameras
Her boyfriend here, but she looking so careless

[Hook]

[Verse 2: Trey Songz]
Hold up, don't you know that this the remix?
And she just got her weave fixed
Niggas go and get your weed lit
All my Cali niggas need it
Let's get to that booty, that you throwin' round baby
I give that booty work, imma never go lazy
Dancing with your girl, in your own world
Face like an angel, is it wrong I can't wait to bang you (bow)
How you acting like a little devil
Speed up, slow down, whoa now, gas pedal
Clap it smack it, grab it, tryin' tell you
Booty dumb, booty dumb, yeah that ass special

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Juicy J]
Bring it back, let's get it baby
I just wanna *** you at the dinner table
Shawty come pull up a seat at the winner's table
We don't get attached, we too busy getting paper
Foreign cars make 'em both lose they top
Just turned 21 and she fiendin' for shots
Heard she from the west coast, all she *** with is Pacs
So I give her California love while I'm high
Like, you remind me of somethin'
Leave the club, we can bang like we from Compton
Pull a Lambo round back, Bel Air we down there
Make a movie in the club, shawty this the soundtrack

[Hook]

[Verse 4: 2 Chainz]
Two red girls, eating red beans and rice
We Popeye's, eat hot fries
You should see what I got parked outside
I kiss my girl every time I'm at a stop sign
My ex left me for another nigga
Now she realized she stuck with a sucker nigga
Uh yeah you a go getta', then you should go get her
The type to put Forgiatos on a four wheeler
I put violators on the floor seat
I'm getting money and you sattin' on my broke meter
I'm straight from section 8, I save coupons
Just bought a car, that bitch came with Grey Poupon
