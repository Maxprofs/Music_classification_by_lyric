Trains and Winter Rains
Enya()

City Streets passing by
Underneath stormy skies.
Neon signs in the night
Red and blue city lights
Cargo trains rolling by
Once again someone cries
Trains and winter rains
No going by, no going home.
Trains across the plains,
And in the sky, the star alone.
La la la
Everytime, it’s the same.
One more night, one more train.
Everywhere empty roads,
Where they go, no one knows.
Trains and winter rains,
No going by, no going home.
Trains across the plains,
And in the sky, the star alone.
Trains and winter rains,
No going by, no going home.
Trains across the plains,
And in the sky, the star alone.
La la la
Da da da da da ... da da da da da da da
Trains and winter rains,
No going by, no going home.
Trains across the plains
And in the sky, the star alone
Trains and winter rains,
No going by, no going home
Trains across the plains
And in the sky, the star alone
                        
                    |
