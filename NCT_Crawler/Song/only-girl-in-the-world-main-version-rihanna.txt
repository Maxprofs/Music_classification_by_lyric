                        Bài hát: Only Girl (In The World) [Main Version] - Rihanna

La, la, la, la
La, la, la, la
La, la, la, la

I want you to love me like I'm a hot guy
Keep thinkin' of me, doin' what you like
So boy, forget about the world
'Cause it's gon' be me and you tonight
I wanna make your bed for ya
Then I'ma make you swallow your pride

Want you to make me feel like I'm the only girl in the world
Like I'm the only one that you'll ever love
Like I'm the only one who knows your heart
Only girl in the world like I'm the only one that's in command

'Cause I'm the only one who understands
How to make you feel like a man
Want you to make me feel like I'm the only girl in the world
Like I'm the only one that you'll ever love
Like I'm the only one who knows your heart, only one

Want you to take me like a thief in the night
Hold me like a pillow, make me feel right
Baby, I'll tell you all my secrets that I'm keepin'
You can come inside

And when you enter, you ain't leavin'
Be my prisoner for the night

Want you to make me feel like I'm the only girl in the world
Like I'm the only one that you'll ever love
Like I'm the only one who knows your heart
Only girl in the world like I'm the only one that's in command

'Cause I'm the only one who understands
Like I'm the only one who knows your heart, only one

Take me for a ride
Oh baby, take me high
Let me make you first
Oh, make it last all night

Take me for a ride
Oh baby, take me high
Let me make you first
Make it last all night

Want you to make me feel like I'm the only girl in the world
Like I'm the only one that you'll ever love
Like I'm the only one who knows your heart
Only girl in the world like I'm the only one that's in command

'Cause I'm the only one who understands
How to make you feel like a man
Only girl in the wo
