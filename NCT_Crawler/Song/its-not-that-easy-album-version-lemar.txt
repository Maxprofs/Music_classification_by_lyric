                        Was it me?
 Was it you?
 Was it all the little things that I didn't do?
 Try to move on, but I cant
 No I can't imagine being someone else's man

 Girl I tried, I tried a million times
 To get you off my mind
 Its not that easy no
 Not that easy
 Don't you know how hard it is for me
 To smile and say goodbye
 It's not that easy no
 It's not that easy

 Its not over
 Not for me
 Used to have so much faith and I still believe
 You're my weakness
 Youre my strength
 And one without the other
 Just don't make no sense

 Girl I tried, I tried a million times
 To get you off my mind
 Its not that easy no
 Not that easy
 Don't you know how hard it is for me
 To smile and say goodbye
 It's not that easy no
 It's not that easy

 Its not as easy for me
 As it is for you
 Let me talk about it
 Its not that easy
 Listen
 What am I meant to do without your love, your love
 What am I meant to do without your love
 Oh what am I meant to do without your love, your love
 What am I meant to do without your love

 Girl I tried, I tried a million times
 To get you off my mind
 Its not that easy no
 Not that easy
 Don't you know how hard it is for me
 To smile and say goodbye
 It's not that easy no
 It's not that easy

 What am I meant to do without your love, your love
 What am I meant to do without your love
 What am I meant to do without your love, your love
 What am I meant to do without your love

 Don't you know how hard it is for me
 To smile and say goodbye
 It's not that easy no
 It's not that easy
