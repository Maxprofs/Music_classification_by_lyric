                        Big lights, people
 Rushing to grow up before you know
 Stop signs, denied
 Everyone tells me I gotta go slow
 And it's gonna hurt sometimes, no matter what you do
 But nothing can change my mind If I'm too young,
 To fall in love,
 Why do you keep running through my brain?
 If I'm too young,
 To know anything,
 Why do I know that I'm just not the same?
 Don't tell me I won't, don't tell me I can't feel,
 What I'm feeling is real!
 'Cause I'm not too young. Raindrops, deep thoughts
 Pictures of you and me wherever I go
 Laughing, running to a place where nobody says no
 It's gonna hurt sometimes, no matter what you do,
 But I've got to fall to fly If I'm too young to fall in love, why do you keep running through my brain?
 If I'm too young to know anything
 Why do I know that I'm just not the same?
 Don't tell me I won't, don't tell me I can't feel what I'm feeling is real
 'Cause I'm not too young
 'Cause I'm not too young, no If I'm too young to fall in love, why do you keep running through my brain?
 And if I'm too young to know anything
 Why do I know that I'm just not the same?
 Don't tell me I won't, don't tell me I can't feel what I'm feeling is real
 'Cause I'm not too young
 'Cause I'm not too young
 I'm not too young
