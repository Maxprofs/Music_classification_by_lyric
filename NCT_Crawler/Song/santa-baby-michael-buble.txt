Santa Baby - 수영

Santa baby slip a sable under the tree
for me I've been an awful good girl
Santa baby and hurry down the chimney tonight

Santa baby an out-of-space convertible too
light blue I'll wait up for you dear
Santa baby and hurry down the chimney tonight

Think of all the fun I've missed
Think of all the fellas that I haven't kissed
Next year I could be oh so good
If you'd check off my Christmas list

Santa baby I wanna yacht and really that's Not
a lot I've been an angel all year
Santa baby so hurry down the chimney tonight

Santa honey one thing I really do need
the deed To a platinum mine
Santa baby so hurry down the chimney tonight

Santa baby I'm filling my stocking with a duplex
and checks Sign your 'X' on the line
Santa baby and hurry down the chimney tonight

Come and trim my Christmas tree
With some decorations bought at Tiffany's
I really do believe in you
Let's see if you believe in me

Santa baby forgot to mention one little thing
a ring I don't mean a phone
Santa baby and hurry down the chimney tonight

Santa baby so hurry tonight
