                        All my problems say

Where are no way from you

And I see

All the angels sit

And stare at you

You’re everything

But not today

I’m so down and out cuz

Something is wrong without you

When you’re not around

Just shadows and rain fall

Wait till tomorrow

I’ll wait

Just wanna be with you

Only you

Always you

You’re so beautiful to me

It’s true

I’m amazed by you

I think I’m falling

All my world is there

Just slipping away

I am next to you

But I fall to pieces and crumble away

Today nothing works

I am so down and out cuz

Something is wrong without you

When you’re not around

Just shadows and rain fall

Wait till tomorrow

Can’t wait

Just wanna be with you

Only you

Always you

You’re so beautiful to me

It’s true

I’m amazed by you

I think I’m falling (falling with you, only you, always you)

You’re so beautiful (beautiful) to me

It’s true (true)

I’m amazed by you

I know I’m falling
