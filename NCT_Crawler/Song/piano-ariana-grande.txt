                        Song: Piano - Ariana Grande

I could write a song by my new piano
I could sing about how love is a losing battle
Not hard, it's not hard
It’s not hard, it’s not hard
It’s not hard, it’s not hard
It’s not hard, it’s not hard
And I could sing about Cupid and his shooting arrow
In the end, you’d find out that my heart was battered
Real hard, it’s so hard
Real hard, it’s that hard

[Pre-Chorus]
But I rather make a song they can play on the radio
That it makes you wanna dance, don’t it make you wanna dance?
But I rather make a song they can play on the radio
That makes you wanna grab your lover's hand

[Chorus]
So hold up and take it through the night
And you should follow through to make it alright
Now grab each others' hands, get ‘em up
I want to see you rock to the piano, the piano

[Verse 2]
I could write a song by my new piano
I could sing about how love is a losing battle
Not hard
(It's not hard)
It's not hard
(it's not hard)
It's not hard
(it's not hard)
It's not hard
(it's not hard)
And I could sing about Cupid and his shooting arrow
In the end, you’d find out that my heart was battered
Real hard
(It's not hard)
It’s so hard
(So hard)
Real hard
(It's that hard)
It’s that hard
(It's that hard)

[Pre-Chorus]
But I rather make a song they can play on the radio
That it makes you wanna dance, don’t it make you wanna dance?
But I rather make a song they can play on the radio
That makes you wanna grab your lover's hand

[Chorus]
So hold up and take it through the night
And you should follow through to make it alright
Now grab each others' hands, get ‘em up
I want to see you rock to the piano, the piano
So hold up and take it through the night
And you should follow through to make it alright
Now grab each others' hands, get ‘em up
I want to see you rock to the piano, the piano

[Bridge]
I’d rather tell you about how I’m feeling boy
And how I’m doing things my way if I got my piano, then I’m gon' be okay

[Chorus]
So hold up and take it through the night
And you should follow through to make it alright
Now grab each others' hands, get ‘em up
I want to see you rock to the piano, the piano
So hold up and take it through the night
And you should follow through to make it alright
Now grab each others' hands, get ‘em up
I want to see you rock to the piano, the piano
So hold up and take it through the night
And you should follow through to make it alright
Now grab each others' hands, get ‘em up
I want to see you rock to the piano, the piano

[Outro]
I could write a song by my new piano
I could sing about how love is a losing battle
It’s not hard, it’s not hard
It’s not hard, it’s not hard
It’s not hard, it’s not hard
It’s not hard
