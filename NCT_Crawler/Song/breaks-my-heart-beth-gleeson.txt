                        Song: Breaks My Heart - Beth Gleeson

I try to see beyond just you and me.
The place where I should be but the truth 
I feel will be revealed whenever you're around. 

Everytime I see you, it just breaks my heart
How can I get used to us apart when everytime I see you
 it just breaks my heart
I thought in time that you would leave my mind 
but how can I forget when you're here so near? 

And though I try, it cannot be denied.
Everytime I see you, it just breaks my heart.
How can I get used to apart when everytime I see you,
it just breaks my heart
How can I get over losing you?
Everything I knew just fell apart.
There's just no getting over losing you 
Oh how to pick myself up anymore

The truth how I feel will always be revealed whenever you're around.
Everytime I see you, it just breaks my heart.
How can I get used to us apart when everytime I see you,
it just breaks my heart, oh.......
everytime I see you, it just breaks my heart.
How can I get used to us apart when everytime I see you, it just breaks my heart.
