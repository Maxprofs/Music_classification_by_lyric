                        Song: Staying Alive - Lynda Trang Đài, Tommy Ngô

Get rolled with the fever on the dance floor
Now who got a fever for the flavor who can dig the way that I flex
On a track can cause a rampage
We can work on point with the nop on style though my lip
There'd be room in the mad joints
So put your hands in the air cause there's a party over here
So grab yourself a beer
Or we can get our fever on I'm with it
So let me put my big brown beefer on

I'm comin with the discos, I can flip so
I'm-a try the solo tip
Stumpin' for da honeys in the crowd, lend me your ear
So I can turn the party out
Til tomorrow afternoon, cause when I raise my spirits
No one leaves the room
So tell me can ya feel the
Matched skills comin' with the fever, fever, fever

Ah, ha, ha, ha stayin alive, stayin alive
Ah, ha, ha, ha stayin alive, stayin alive
Ah, ha, ha, ha stayin alive, stayin alive
Ah, ha, ha, ha stayin alive
Get rolled with the fever on the dance floor

Step to the side, you'd better run and hide
More to the side, everybody wants to stay alive

Everybody's in the house, we have to own respect
So you can break your fears out
N-Trance I'm the only one, we got it goin on
So let me get my flowin' on
If the blast from the pasts that you heard of me
And the boys comin down with murder
And it's gotta be da way, everybody wants to make a move
So just party

Or we can have a jam, so get your move on
I'm-a take this groove and slam
Flip how I want it flipped, from the back to the front
When I props me the manuscript
Cause I got the moves and I'm always gonna flow
With the crazy, crazy groove
So can ya tell do ya feel the
Matched skills comin with the fever, fever, fever

Ah, ha, ha, ha stayin alive, stayin alive
Ah, ha, ha, ha stayin alive, stayin alive
Ah, ha, ha, ha stayin alive, stayin' alive
Ah, ha, ha, ha stayin alive
Get rolled with the fever on the dance floor

Step to the side, you'd better run and hide
More to the side, everybody wants to stay alive
Step to the side, you'd better run and hide
More to the side, everybody wants to stay alive

Everybody in the house c'mon and let me hear ya say ho
Everybody in the house c'mon and let me hear ya say ho
Everybody in the house c'mon and let me hear ya say ho
Everybody in the house c'mon and let me hear ya say ho.

It's about time, everybody in the house
Put the lick to my vicious rule and rhymes
We can work on a tip, with my boys bringin disco noise
As I brought the wickedness
Gettin sharp with the flow, we took a Bees Gees flip
And broke it down like get-go
A disco lick that's deeper
Cause we gotta get with da fever, fever, fever

Ah, ha, ha, ha stayin alive, stayin alive
Ah, ha, ha, ha stayin alive, stayin alive
Ah, ha, ha, ha stayin alive, stayin alive
Ah, ha, ha, ha stayin alive
Get rolled with the fever on the dance floor
