                        Bài hát: Wrongest Way - Sonny

[Intro]
Oh, girl...what cha deal is?
I been eyeing you like: "Oh, my goodness!"
Let's spend some time somewhere and kick it
Cause I'm like hold up, hold up, hold up, whoo!

[Verse 1]
I'mma pull up in my jag
Got me bouncing like an 808
She all about the cash
Watch her do me like a meter maid
Pull up to the crib, they know we can get it boo
She only tryna be my thing, girl you know...

[Chorus]
I wanna getchu somewhere right away
I'm bout to take you to my private place
Ooh, girl, we bout to misbehave (ooh, babe)
Just say you want me in the wrongest way (oh, oh, ohh)
(oh, oh, ohh)

[Hook]
Holla at cha boy, taking off! (oh, ooh, uh, ohha)
In a crowd, I see you! (oh, ooh, uh, ohha)
Girl, you know what do! (oh, ooh, uh, ohha)
Get her looks from her mama! (oh, ooh, uh, ohha)
Hold up, hold up, hold up


[Verse 2]
She got it
She got a lot of flavor, and she keeping it poppin'
Girl don't be a tease, no, I don't want you to stop it
I swear I'm just a beast, it's hard for me to get off it
I'm gonna mmm

But if she doesn't feel my vibe
It's alright, ya boy will be okay
She can be the light, she just doing what her girlfriends say
They all up in my back, tryna pull me off of lay-away
I ain't gonna be ya friend, now ya know

[Chorus]
I wanna getchu somewhere right away
I'm bout to take you to my private place
Ooh, girl, we bout to misbehave
Just say you want me in the wrongest way

[Hook]
Holla at cha boy, taking off! (oh, ooh, uh, ohha)
In a crowd, I see you! (oh, ooh, uh, ohha - I see you girl!)
Girl, you know what do! (oh, ooh, uh, ohha - Yeah, you know what to do)
Get her looks from her mama! (oh, ooh, uh, ohha - mama!)
Hold up, hold up, hold up

[Bridge] x2
Girl you know that you're the baddest, you're the baddest
Wanna get you to my palace, make it last
No make believe, it's going down, it's going down
Cause when I get you to my room, it's up to you


[Chorus] x2
I wanna getchu somewhere right away (right away)
I'm bout to take you to my private place (private place)
Ooh, girl, we bout to misbehave (ooh, girl)
Just say you want me in the wrongest way

[Outro]
Oh, darling
I wanna take you somewhere right away
I wanna get you in the wrongest way
Hold up, hold up, hold up, hold up

You're the only one, I mean it
You're the only one, I mean it (oh, ooh, uh, ohha)
You're the only one, I mean it
You're the only one, I mean it
Hold up, hold up, hold up, hold up
                        
                    |
