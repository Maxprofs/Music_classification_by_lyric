Don't Make Me Wait For Love
michael bolton
Sitting here just staring at your picture
Waiting for your call
So unclear,
I'm hanging on a notion
We could have it all
Time and time again you tell me to be patient
But we can't let love slip away
Baby, don't make me wait for love this time
ohOoh, oh, darlin
a love like this is hard to find
Don't make me wait for love
I close the blinds and try to hide the darkness
Fall asleep alone
Give me a sign, a man ain't supposed to face life
Standing on his own
When you're near me I can't help but see forever
Come and rescue me tonight
Baby, don't make me wait for love this time
ohOh, oh, darlin
a love like this is hard to find
Don't make me wait for love
Don't make me wait for love this time
a love like this is hard to find
