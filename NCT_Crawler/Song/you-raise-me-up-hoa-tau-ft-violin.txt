                        Bài hát : You Raise Me Up - Hòa Tấu, Violin

When i am down 
And oh my soul so weary 
When troubles come 
And my heart burdened be 
Then i am still 
And wait here in the silence 
Until you come, and sit awhile with me 
You raise me up 
So i can stand on mountanis 
You raise me up, to walk on stormy seas 
I am strong, when i am on your shoulders 
You raise me up 
To more then i can be 
You raise me up 
So i can stang on mountains 
You raise me up 
To walk on stormy seas 
I am strong 
When i am on your shoulders 
You raise me up, to more then i can be 
There is no life 
No life without its hunger 
Each restless heart 
Beats so imperfectly 
But when you come 
I am felled with wonder 
Sometimes i think i glimpse eternity 
(You raise me up so i can stand on mountanis) 
I can stand on mountanis 
(You raise me up, to walk on stromy seas) 
And i am strong 
When i am on your shoulders 
You raise me up to more than i can be (x2)
                        
                    |
