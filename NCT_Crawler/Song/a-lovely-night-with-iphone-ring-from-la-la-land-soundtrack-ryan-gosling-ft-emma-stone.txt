                        Bài hát: A Lovely Night (From "La La Land" Soundtrack) - Ryan Gosling, Emma Stone

The sun is nearly gone
No lights are turning on
A silver shine that stretches to the sea

We stumble on a view
That's tailor made for two
What a shame those two are you and me
Some other girl and I
Would love the swirling sky
But there's only you and I
And we've got, no shot
This could never be
You're not the type for me

Really?

And there's not a spark in sight
What a, a waste of a lovely night

You say there's nothing here
Well let's make something clear
I think I'll be the one to make that call

But you'll call

I know you looked so cute
In your polyester suit

It's wool

You're right I'd never fall for you at all
And maybe this appeals
To someone not in heels
Or to any girl who feels
There's some chance
For romance
But, I'm frankly feeling nothing

Is that so?

Or it could be less than nothing

Good to know
So you agree?

That's right

What a waste of a lovely night
                        
                    |
