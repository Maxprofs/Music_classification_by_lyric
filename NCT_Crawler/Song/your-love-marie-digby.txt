                        I can never find the words to describe what you do to me
If i did it would sound like a hundred symphonies
The sun would descend from the sky
Just to see who stole all his light and glory
You and me can't you see
We could change all of history :)

When the crowd parts and I find you face
Its only you I'm seeing

Your love, your love your love, is all that i need
Your love your love your love so honey stay right here with me
Your touch, your smile, your kiss, your heart is lighting me up
Your love your love, is all that i need, oh



I remember walking with you on that april night
I was cold and you knew it so you asked me if i'm alright
Then you reached for my hand
Held it tightly in yours
And neither of us could say a thing
But the look on your face
To me, it meant it everything

Now, I can't help repeating what happened that day over and over

Your love, your love your love, is all that i need
Your love your love your love so honey stay right here with me
Your touch, your smile, your kiss, your heart is lighting me up
Your love your love, is all that i need, oh

If something is good it can last forever
So hold me tightly like time don't matter when we're together

Your love, your love your love, is all that i need
Your love your love your love so honey stay right here with me
Your touch, your smile, your kiss, your heart is lighting me up
Your love your love, is all that i need
                        
                    |
