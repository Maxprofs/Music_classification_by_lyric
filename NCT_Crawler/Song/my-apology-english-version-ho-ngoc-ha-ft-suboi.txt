                        Bài hát : My Apology (English Version) - Hồ Ngọc Hà, Suboi

I blamed you for everything that was going on 
I was angry and didn't know right from wrong 
I wish I could turn back the hands of time 
I wish I wasn't so damn blind 
All the pain and the suffering, I wish I could take it back 
All the swearing and fights, I wish I could take it back 
All the blaming and swearing, I wish I could take it back 
I wish I could take it all back

Sorry, can we work things out again 
Can we go back to the time you were my man 
I will love you like I should 
Love you like any person would 
Oh please, accept my apology 

Sorry, can we work things out again 
Can we go back to the time you were my man 
I will love you like I should 
Love you like any person would 
Oh please, accept my apology 

[RAP]
Boy I want you back
Let me put it down
You need to know that
I'm gonna tell you now
How much I really miss you
So please accept my apology

I pushed you away, cause I was angry at you 
Now I know that I was wrong, and it was my fault too 
Now I am alone and wishing you were here 
I will change, no more anger and tears 

All the pain and the suffering, I wish I could take it back 
All the swearing and fights, I wish I could take it back 
All the blaming and swearing, I wish I could take it back 
I wish I could take it all back

Sorry, can we work things out again 
Can we go back to the time you were my man 
I will love you like I should 
Love you like any person would 
Oh please, accept my apology 

Sorry, can we work things out again 
Can we go back to the time you were my man 
I will love you like I should 
Love you like any person would 
Oh please, accept my apology 
I understand if you are going away, but still I beg you to stay 
The lonely nights are killing me, please accept my apology.
Sorry...

[RAP]
You, this is my apology to you
Right here
I'm really sorry for what I did to you
I wanna make this
So comeback
Baby please
I really want to say this ...
Sorry, can we work things out again 
Can we go back to the time you were my man 
I will love you like I should 
Love you like any person would 
Oh please, accept my apology 

Sorry, can we work things out again 
Can we go back to the time you were my man 
I will love you like I should 
Love you like any person would 
Oh please, accept my apology 

[RAP]
Please accept my apology
Oh please, accept my apology
Oh please, baby
Oh please, accept my apology !
