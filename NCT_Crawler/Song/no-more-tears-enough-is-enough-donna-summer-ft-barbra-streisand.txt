                        It's raining, it's pouring
 My love life is boring me to tears,
 After all these years No sunshine, no moonlight,
 No stardust, no sign of romance
 We don't stand a chance I've always dreamed I find the perfect lover
 But he turned out to be like every other man
 Our love, our love Raining (raining)
 Pouring (pouring)
 There's nothing left for us here
 And we won't waste another tear If you've had enough,
 Don't put up with his stuff,
 Don't you do it
 If you've had your fill,
 Get the check, pay the bill,
 You can do it Tell him to just get out
 Nothing left to talk about
 Pack his raincoat show him out
 Just look him in the eye and simple shout Enough is enough
 I can't go on, I can't go on, no more no
 Enough is enough
 I want him out, I want him out that door now I've always dreamed I'd find the perfect lover,
 But he turned out to be like every other man
 Our love (I had no choice from the start)
 Our love (I've gotta listen to my heart)
 Our love (tearing us apart) Enough, is enough, is enough
 I can't go on, I can't go on no more no
 Enough, is enough, is enough
 I want him out, I want him out that door now Goodbye mister, goodbye,
 Goodbye mister, goodbye sugar No more tears
 No more tears
 No more tears
 I've had it, you've had it, he's had it, we've had it
 Enough is enough is enough is enough Is enough is enough is enough is enough is enough
 Is enough is enough is enough is enough is enough!
