No, no, no I'm not bitter, I'm not mad
Well, maybe just a little, just a tad
I know every apple here ain't bad
But I found a warm in every single one I've had

Boys, they're only good for food, I mean, bananas
Boys, them boys are nuts, they drive me bananas
Oh boys, we should pack them up and chip them out
Boys, boys, boys
I hate them
I hate boys, but boys love me
I think they suck and my friends agree
I hate boys, but boys love me
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I hate boys
]
If you hate them boys, shake it, now shake it
If you hate them boys, shake it, now shake it
We will all be happy, all be glad
It's sweet, momma nature never had
All these dirty little boys will think that the girls
Will only make them toys
Boys want some women, but they really can't remember
Then again, all men are dogs
All men are dogs
I hate boys, but boys love me (boys love me)
I think they suck and my friends agree
I hate boys, but boys love me
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I hate boys
If you hate them boys, shake it, now shake it
If you hate them boys, shake it

Let's go
Boys suck, makes me sick
Men are evil, little dick
Use them up, spit tem out
I-H-A-T-E

I hate boys, but boys love me (boys love me, oh yeah)
I think they suck and my friends agree (ooh)
I hate boys, but boys love me
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (hey yeah)
I hate boys
I hate boys, but boys love me
I think they suck and my friends agree (ooh yeah)
I hate boys, but boys love me (ooh yeah)
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I hate boys
