                        Bài hát: Carry On (Her Letter To Him) - Ne-Yo

[Intro:]
Ah, carry on, carry on, yeah
Ah, carry on, carry on, yeah

[Verse 1:]
I said uhu, so you found another bed you'd rather sleep in tonight, yeah
I said uhu, so I gotta lose for what you think is a win tonight, yo,
Said uhu, some night is tonight that you won't answer your phone, yeah
I said uhu, soundtrack of the scene be the sound of my ringtone
As I call you all night long

[Chorus:]
Well go and carry on
Go and carry on whoa
I said do you, cause I'm through
Hold on, I won't so carry on, ay

[Verse 2:]
Uhu, so you found another reason to go do what you do, yeah, yeah
I said uhu, well I've run out of reasons to sit here waiting on you, whoa
I said uhu, you showed me now exactly what you want,
What you want, ay,
Uhu, now learn that you're exactly what I don't
Too much for too long

[Chorus:]
So go and carry on
So go and carry on
I said do you, cause I'm through
Hold on, I won't so carry on, ay
So carry on

[Bridge:]
You don't want it
And I don't need it
Better use for my time
So carry on
Cause you don't want it
Said I don't deserve it
I'm moving along with mine, ay, uhu, uhu
Uhu, uhu, uhu

[Chorus:]
So carry on, ay
Carry on, ay
I said do you, cause I'm through
Hold on
I won't so carry on, ay
Oho, whoa, carry on
                        
                    |
