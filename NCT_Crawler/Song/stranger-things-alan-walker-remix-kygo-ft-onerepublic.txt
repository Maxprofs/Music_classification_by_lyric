                        Bài hát: Stranger Things (Alan Walker Remix) - Kygo, OneRepublic

Castles glitter under Spanish skies
But I'm just looking out for you tonight

[Verse 1]
We used to run around this ghost town
Always thinking out loud
Are we gonna get out?
I remember
We dream of places that we could go
Castles with the strange glow
People that we don't know
I remember

[Pre-Chorus 1]
We left a life
That's ordinary from the start
We looked for stranger things
'Cause that's just who we are
Found me the edge of something beautiful and loud
Like I'm picturing now

[Chorus]
Castles glitter under Spanish skies
But I'm just looking out for you tonight
Snow white mountains in a foreign state
Tell me someday we'll get there
                        
                    |
