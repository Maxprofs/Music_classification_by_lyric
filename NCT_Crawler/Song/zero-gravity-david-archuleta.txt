                        Tell me what you did to me
Just air beneath my feet
Didn't even notice we were miles above the ground
I'm not afraid of heights
We crashed into the sky
Didn't know that I could feel the way that I do now
I'm not asking for an explanation
All I know is that you take me away
And you show me how to fly

Nothing brings me down
When you're around
It's like zero gravity
The world just disappears
When you're here
It's zero gravity
When things get messed up
I lift my head up
And I get lost in the clouds
There's no sense of time with you around
It's zero gravity

The ages fade away
Till there's no more shades of gray
You only have to whisper anything at all
You opened up my eyes
You turn my lows to highs
And up's the only way that I know how to fall
Not gonna analyze or try to fight it
Don't even care if it makes no sense at all

'Cause with you I can fly

Nothing brings me down
When you're around
It's like zero gravity
The world just disappears
When you're here
It's zero gravity
When things get messed up
I lift my head up
And I get lost in the clouds
There's no sense of time with you around
It's zero gravity

You make it
So easy
To just drift away
I can't
Imagine
Being without you

Don't think about it
Don't think about it
Don't think about it
Don't think about it
Don't think about it
Don't think about it
Don't think about it

Nothing brings me down
When you're around
It's like zero gravity
The world just disappears
When you're here
It's zero gravity

Nothing brings me down
When you're around
It's like zero gravity
The world just disappears
When you're here
It's zero gravity
                        
                    |
