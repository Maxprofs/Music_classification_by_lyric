                        Bài hát: Fever - The Black Keys

Fever where'd you run to
Fever where'd you run to
Acting out of certainty
A fever let me live a dream
Fever, how much slept on
No one misbehave too
Fever let me sun screw
Wouldn't leave you if I could
Fever

Fever ‘cause I’m breaking
Fever got me aching
Fever how will you explain
Break it down again
Fever got me guilty
Just go ahead and kill me
Fever how will you explain
Break it down again

Fever can you hear me
Fever can you hear me
You shook me like I never been
Now show me how to love again
                        
                    |
