                        I never said I'd lie and wait forever.
If I died we'd be together.
I cant always just forget her.
My Chemical Romance
But she could try.
At the end of the worldor the last thing i see.
You are never coming home.
Could I? Should I? And all the things that you never ever told me.
And all the smiles that are ever ever. ever.
Get the feeling that you're never.
At the top of my lungs in my arms. She dies.
She dies.
At the end of the world. Or the last thing i see.
You are never coming home.
Could I? Should I?
And all the wounds that are ever gonna scar me.
And all the ghosts that are never gonna catch me.
If i fall down.
