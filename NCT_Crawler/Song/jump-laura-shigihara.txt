                        Bài hát: Jump - Laura Shigihara

Underneath the Big Dipper we gathered stars 
We took off both our slippers 
And sank into the water 

Then we swam beneath a bridge 
We met a man who sold us what we needed 
He gave us directions 

And we swim 
And we fall 
Hold my hand 
Through it all 

If we jump into the water 
would we swim or would we drown? 
If we built a set of wings 
then could we fly or just fall down? 
And if you keep talking to me 
through this darkness through this night 
I'll be alright 

Though we were without a map 
without a plan, without a destination 
we knew were we were going 

We put feathers on our backs 
And climbed so we could see all that below us 
Before we let go 

And we fly 
And we fall 
Hold my hand 
Through it all 

If we jump into the water 
would we swim or would we drown? 
If we built a set of wings 
then could we fly or just fall down? 
And if you keep talking to me 
through this darkness through this night 
I'll be alright 

Would you hold me so I'd never be afraid 
As the sky falls down around us now 
If you tell me everything will be okay 
I'll believe you, you don't have to tell me how
                        
                    |
