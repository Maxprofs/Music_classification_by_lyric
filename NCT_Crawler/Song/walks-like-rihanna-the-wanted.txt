                        Have you seen that girl, have you seen her
She's the freakiest thing, you gotta need her
You do whatever it takes to get her by your side, woah
It's not the way she smiles, with her little laugh
It's not the way she looks in a photograph
But all the boys they crowd around

She can't sing, she can't dance but who cares
She walks like rihanna
She can't sing, she can't dance but who cares
She walks like rihanna

Have you seen that girl, have you seen her
With the way she moves you wanna kiss her
She'll be the girl of your dreams if you can close your eyes
You can feel that beat when she's in the room
You can feel your heart going boom boom
And all the boys they crowd around

She can't sing, she can't dance but who cares
She walks like rihanna
She can't sing, she can't dance but who cares
She walks like rihanna

She walks like rihanna

(Instrument al)

Our hearts go boom boom boom boom
Our hearts go boom boom boom boom
Our hearts go boom boom boom boom
Our hearts go boom boom boom boom

Our hearts go boom boom boom boom
Our hearts go boom boom boom boom

She can't sing, she can't dance but who cares
She walks like rihanna
She can't sing, she can't dance but who cares
She walks like rihanna

She walks like rihanna

Our hearts go boom boom boom boom
                        
                    |
