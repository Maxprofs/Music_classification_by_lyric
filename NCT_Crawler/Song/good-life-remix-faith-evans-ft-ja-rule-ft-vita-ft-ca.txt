                        [Caddillac Tah]:
 Ain't no niggas like the murderers
 Gettin crunk buyin the bar tearin the club
 We live the good life
 Very expensive cars and them broads you handcuffin
 We run through man it's nothin man we huntin
 For houses in the Hampton just a little somethin to lamp in
 Me and my campin we ball like professional ballas do it
 Better yet no other how you love it
 Man we livin the good life [Faith Evans]:
 Seven days of work with no break
 Gotta take a day off to unwind
 It gives me time to get away
 A little time to ease my mind, my mind [Chorus]:
 Forget about your worries save your problems for tomorrow
 Tonight just try to have a good time (gotta have a good time)
 DJ make you easy the music help you do it
 Tell me don't you wanna live the good life (and have a good time yeah)
 The good life [Faith Evans]:
 Good friends no stress
 Is the good life
 Laid back relax
 In the good life
 Good love no mess is
 The good life
 Wanna live in the good life [Ja Rule]:
 Baby baby
 What that remind you of
 Not Dre B.I.G. and Faith was in love
 The good life
 Live it up however you life
 Drip your body and ice is the glove in tonight
 Is that right
 Pull up in the V12 6 Zu me and you
 The good life
 Get in the club toast it up
 Cause he can't get enough of
 The good life [Faith Evans]:
 Dancin with a glass of champagne or maybe Chardonay
 Keeps me feelin good all night
 See so many happy people on the floor
 Leave your problems at the door [Chorus] [Faith Evans]:
 Good friends no stress is

 V-I-T-A
 When I come through the door I work the floor
 We gon sip all night hangle Remy for ya'll
 Stay cute star studded with a platinum cross
 VS1 D diamond with a rainbow gloss
 But that ain't half a what I do when I flood the scene
 Showin sassy but petite but my pockets mean
 Yeah I live the good life in the been body bin
 S25 with a 7-2 rim it's the good life [Faith Evans]:
 Don't you wanna live in

 Laid back relax in

 Good friends good love in
