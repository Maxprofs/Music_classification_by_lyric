                        Frustration (watching you dance)
 Hesitation (to get in them pants)
 Come closer baby (so I can touch)
 One question, Am I moving too fast? 'Cause I ain't leaving alone, feel like I could be outer-space
 We both know that we're grown
 That's why I wanna know How many drinks would it take you to leave with me?
 Yeah you look good, and I got money but I don't wanna waste my time
 Back of my mind, I'm hoping you say two or three
 You look good, we came to party, but I don't wanna waste my time Temptation (is calling your name)
 Sweet persuasion, oh (baby this is a game)
 Come closer baby (if you like what you hear)
 Impassioned (is what I'm making you feel) Cause' I ain't leaving alone, I feel like I could be outer-space
 We both know that we're grown
 That's why I wanna know How many drinks would it take you to leave with me?
 Yeah you look good, and I got money but I don't wanna waste my time
 Back of my mind, I'm hoping you say two or three
 You look good, we came to party, but I don't wanna waste my time
 Waste my time No no no
 I ain't judging if you do decide that you might be *** tonight
 What?
 More power to you if you do decide that you might be *** tonight
