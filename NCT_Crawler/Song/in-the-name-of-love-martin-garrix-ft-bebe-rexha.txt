                        Bài hát: In the Name of Love - Martin Garrix, Bebe Rexha

[Bebe Rexha]
If I told you
This was only gonna hurt
If I warned you
That the fire's gonna burn
Would you walk In
Would you let me do it first
Do It all In the name of love

Would you let me
Lead you even when you're blind
In the darkness
In the middle of the night
In the silence
When there's no one by your side
Would you call In the name of love

In the name of love , name of love
In the name of love , name of love

In the name of

If I told you
We could bathe in all the lights
Would you rise up
Come and meet me in the sky
Would you trust me
When you're jumping from the heights
Would you fall In the name of love

When there's madness
When there's poison in your head
When the sadness
Leaves you broken in your bed
I will hold you 
In the depths of your despair
And it's all In the name of love

In the name of love , name of love
In the name of love , name of love

In the name of

[Nhạc]

I wanna testify
Scream in the holy light
You bring me back to life
And It's all in the name of love

I wanna testify
Scream in the holy light
You bring me back to life
And It's all in the name of love

In the name of love , name of love
In the name of love , name of love

In the name of
