Delta Goodrem-One Day

One day I'll learn to like myself
One day I'll finally get it right
And I'll try till time catches up with me
One day I'll be too old to care

Ooh
one day
Ooh
one day it will be okay

One day I'll speak some Japanese
One day I'll learn to play guitar
And I'll stop procrastinating
And get up off this chair
One day is always one day late

Ooh one day it will be okay

So I'll get up and try it again
So I'll pick myself up and I'll say
One day it will be okay

One day my heart will find a friend
One day I'll make the perfect wife
And I'll change my name just for him
All of these things I'll do one day

Ooh one day it will be okay
Ooh one day it will be okay
So I'll get up and try it again
So I'll pick myself up and I'll say
One day it will be okay
