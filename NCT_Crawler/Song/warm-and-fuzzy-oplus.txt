                        Bài hát: Warm And Fuzzy - OPlus

Sleigh bells ringing
Quire singing,
Wondering what ole Santa's bringing
It's the warm and fuzzy time of year

Snow flakes fall
The temp is dropping
Families out together shopping
It's the warm and fuzzy time of year 

Elves are working over time 
Making all our toys 
Reindeer hooves on all the roofs 
Good little girls and boys 
Big old cups of steaming cider 
Fall asleep by the cozy fire
It's the warm and fuzzy time of year

Elves are working over time
Making all our toys
Reindeer hooves on all the rooves
Good little girls and boys
Big old cup of steaming cider
Fall asleep by the cozy fire 

It's the warm and fuzzy time of year
It's the warm and fuzzy time of year
