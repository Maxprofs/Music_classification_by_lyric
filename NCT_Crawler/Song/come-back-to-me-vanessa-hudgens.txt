                        [Intro]
HaHa!
You all need to get ready to hear
The unbelievable,
Indescribable
Vanessa Hudgens.
Baby V!

(Baby Come Back)

Everyday, I try to play, another game
But my heart can’t take it.
I try to find, another boy,
But all the while, I can’t face it.
Why do I miss you so much?
I wanna stop this hurt inside
Oh baby please, give us one more try

(Baby Come Back)

I see you out with all your friends
Laughin’ it up as you pretend
To have a good time, (good time)
I know cause I'm living the same lie (same lie)
So one of us has got to say
We can't keep living this same way
So I’ll be the one
Yeah I’ll say it, I’ll say it, I’ll say it, I’ll say it again

Baby Come back to me
In my heart I still believe
We were meant to be...
Together so whatever it takes (Baby Come Back)
Baby come back to me
I should have never set you free
My baby
Come back (Baby Come Back)

I wanna call, but then I stall,
Cause after all, I just couldn’t take it
Cause if your play was to push me away
You know that day, my heart you’d break it (Baby Come Back)
I know we made a mistake, (I do)
Can’t you stop your foolish pride (Oh no)
And come back to me
Let’s try, Let’s try, Let’s try, Let’s try it again

Baby Come back to me (Come Back)
In my heart I still believe
We were meant to be...
Together so whatever it takes (Baby Come Back)
Baby come back to me
I should have never set you free
My baby
Come back (Baby Come Back)

[Bridge:]
You know you miss your baby V
And I can see that you think about me
So why do you act like you don’t care
Like all this love between us isn’t there
I know that you're upset
I know I did you wrong
I know that you want me to pay for all the pain I’ve caused
But in the end it all comes down to just one thing,
It’s you and me
So I sing

Baby Come Back!

Baby Come back to me
In my heart I still believe
We were meant to be...
Together so whatever it takes (Baby V!)
Baby come back to me (Come Back)
I should have never set you free
My baby
Come back
(Baby Come Back!)
