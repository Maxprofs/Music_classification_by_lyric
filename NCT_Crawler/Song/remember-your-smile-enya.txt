                        Bài hát: Remember Your Smile - Enya

Lost in the mountains
Far from the crowds
We would wander together
Walking for miles
With the night still before us
And day passing by
I always remember your smile

Cool in the evening
Warm in the sun
Their clouds moving slowly
Time was undone
Yet the days fell before us
And nights rolled on by
I always remember your smile

Every step and each moment
Were all so worthwhile
I always remember your smile

I always remember your smile

And it's strange how for a moment
The heavens were mine
I always remember your smile

Each one has a journey
That's how it goes
Sometimes we're together
Sometimes alone
                        
                    |
