                        Bài hát: Slow Down Love - Louis The Child

[Verse 1: Chelsea Cutler]
Painting you picture of the feelings that you never did, ooh
Do you hear the voices in my head
Calling for something to know?

[Pre-Chorus: Chelsea Cutler]
Slow it down, love, it's too bright out there
Out there
Hold on, love, you're walking thin air
Thin air

[Chorus: Chelsea Cutler]
Dammit, now if you know you're in or out
Oh, I put too much behind it
Dammit, now if there's something I left out
Oh, I'm in my head, come and find me
Dammit, now if you know you're in or out
Oh, I put too much behind it
Dammit, now if there's something I left out
Oh, I'm in my head, come and find me

[Verse 2]
All this time I waited on a future that you never did
And despite all the love I gave
You wanted something I can't give

[Pre-Chorus: Chelsea Cutler]
Slow it down, love, it's too bright out there
Out there
Hold on, love, you're walking thin air
Thin air

[Chorus: Chelsea Cutler]
Dammit, now if you know you're in or out
Oh, I put too much behind it
Dammit, now if there's something I left out
Oh, I'm in my head, come and find me
Dammit, now if you know you're in or out
Oh, I put too much behind it
Dammit, now if there's something I left out
Oh, I'm in my head, come and find me
                        
                    |
