                        Love me with all your heart 
That ́s all I want love 
Love me with all your heart 
or not at all 
Just promise me this 
that all you ́ll give me 
all your kisses 
Every winter 
every summer 
every fall 
When we are far apart 
or when you ́re near me 
Love me with all your heart 
as I love you 
Don ́t give me your love 
for a moment 
or an hour 
Love me always 
as you loved me 
from the start 
With every beat of your heart
                        
                    |
