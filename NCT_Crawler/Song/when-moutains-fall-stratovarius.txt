                        It was just like yesterday
When you chose to leave and I to stay
It was a warm and sunny day
But my heart felt as heavy as stone

Never told me where you went
Then again I never tried to ask
Now I know in life you have one chance
and you better use it well

When the mountains fall 
And the oceans flood
I'm still in search of you
Only thing I want to say
I'm still in love with you

Finally I found your place
Sadly I came three summers late
Now I am sitting by your grave
and I sing this song for you

When the mountains fall 
And the oceans flood
I'm still in search of you
Only thing I want to say
I'm still in love with you

One last thing I have to say
I'm still in love with you
                        
                    |
