L.$. Feat. Tease - Gimmie Dat

Gimme that if you dont I'ma smack you
Speeding through my lanes while ya all stuck in traffic
Go hard in the plane by 12 of the magic
Follow like the king is he all the madras
Love so priceless you cant buy me (you cant buy me)
Lucky I had to get just call me Tyre
West side California is where you find me
I'm so fly sky thats why you sleep by me
We've got the 1 2 purse like money made weather
Cant get in the game no joke he aint pleasure
You know I stay grip I'ma fly like the feather
Flow so sharp and I'll leave your heads sipping
I'ma wrap in jewelry champagne QB
And Tease's gonna run damn like his name is L3
From the north to the south from the west to the east
To the day I die I'ma rip in 9-16

Now lets fly duce from the SAC
Tryna put the second men I wanna MAP
Looking for this guy hes murder in supreme night
LA Sentiz and we're gonna take the game like

Gimme that (gi-gimme that)
Gimme that gimme that (n we gonna take the game like)
Gimme that (gi-gimme that)
Gimme that gimme that (n we gonna take the game like)
Gimme that

No joke I want it
You girl doubt that
No joke I'm on it
No JK rather call me Tease
I'll respect swagger but no strong enemy
Hey its kind of funny how the girls responded me
Gotta be athletes by the way they run to me
To fly duce from the SAC
I'ma pull a second man I want MAP
Yeah they cant fit it so you know its never nothing
But I'ma shut it down Tyre don't mark us presence
You know why I make you run in hot weather
Go hard in the play everytime Chris grab her
Look I dont know why I'm just a guy
No jack blue watch your guy super fly
And everything that I do too easy
Mozzarella dance song cus I stay cheesy

Fly duce from the SAC
Tryna put the second men I wanna MAP
Looking for this guy hes murder in supreme night
LA Sentiz and we're gonna take the game like

Gimme that (gi-gimme that)
Gimme that gimme that (n we gonna take the game like)
Gimme that (gi-gimme that)
Gimme that gimme that (n we gonna take the game like)

Sap camp thats where you find it easy
Tears write us snoop no sinners like gresey
I'm sick of why they're grabbing and saying they are so dough
Saying that they got box from bro I got mo
Comming out read stops and hit like kanbo
Should I say it again I need you to get the memo
Hear the world is cold you know we've got the heat
It's time to burn it up right LA Sentiz
About to bust to rhyme no flip no
Beat this game up like damn damn
No flents Johnny Jonky and play it out like an nintendo
Kshawn on the beat making his like kanbo
LA Sentiz from the 9-16
Don't play footballs through though we bow that grin
Its just to 80's but I still make it quick
Got my cash money young money but no drink left

Fly duce from the SAC
Tryna put the second men I wanna MAP
Looking for this guy hes murder in supreme night
LA Sentiz and we're gonna take the game like

Gimme that (gi-gimme that)
Gimme that gimme that (n we gonna take the game like)
Gimme that (gi-gimme that)
Gimme that gimme that (n we gonna take the game like)
Gimme that
Gimme that
Gimme that
Gimme that
