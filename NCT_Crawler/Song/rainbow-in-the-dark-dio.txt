                        Bài hát: Rainbow In The Dark - Dio

When there's lightning – you know it always bring me down
Cause it's free and I see that it's me
Who's lost and never found
I cry out for magic - see it dancing in the light
It was cold - lost my hold
To the shadows of the night

No sign of the morning coming
You've been left on your own
Like a Rainbow in the Dark
A Rainbow in the Dark

Do your demons - do they ever let you go
When you've tried - do they hide - deep inside
Is it someone that you know
You're just a picture – You’re an image caught in time
We're a lie - you and I
We are words without a rhyme

There’s no sign of the morning coming
You've been left on your own
Like a Rainbow in the Dark
Just a Rainbow in the Dark - Yeah

When there's lightning – you know it always brings me down
Cause it's free and I see that it's me
Who's lost and never found
I cry out for magic – see it floating in the air
But it's fear - and you'll hear
It calling you beware – look out

There’s no sign of the morning coming
There's no sight of the day
You've been left on your own
Like a Rainbow
Like a Rainbow in the Dark
You’re a Rainbow in the Dark
Just Rainbow in the Dark
A Rainbow in the Dark
Too many mornings
Rainbow in the Dark, dark, dark
I see you’re all, you’re all, you’re all Rainbows
You are Rainbows in the Dark
