                        Always see it on TV
 Or read it in the magazines
 Celebrities want sympathy
 All they do is piss and moan
 Inside the Rolling Stone
 Talking about how hard life can be I'd like to see them spend the week
 Livin' life out on the street
 I don't think they would survive
 If they could spend a day or two
 Walking in someone else's shoes
 I think they'd stumble and they'd fall
 They would fall
 (Fall) Lifestyles of the rich and the famous
 They're always complaining
 Always complaining
 If money is such a problem
 Well they got mansions
 Think we should rob them Did you know when you were famous
 You could kill your wife
 And there's no such thing as
 25 to life as long as you've got the cash
 To pay for Cochran And did you know if you were caught
 And you were smoking crack
 McDonald's wouldn't even want to take you back
 You could always just run for mayor of D.C. I'd like to see them spend the week
 Livin' life out on the street
 I don't think they would survive
 If they could spend a day or two
 Walking in someone else's shoes
 I think they'd stumble and they'd fall
 They would fall
 (Fall) Lifestyles of the rich and the famous
 They're always complaining
 Always complaining
 If money is such a problem
 Well they got mansions
 Think we should rob them Lifestyles of the rich and the famous
 They're always complaining
 Always complaining
 If money is such a problem
 You got so many problems
 Think I could solve them Lifestyles of the rich and famous
 We'll take your clothes, cash cards
 And homes, just stop complaining
 Lifestyles of the rich and famous
 Lifestyles of the rich and famous
 Lifestyles of the rich and famous
