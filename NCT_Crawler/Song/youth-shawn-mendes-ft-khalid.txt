                        Bài hát: Youth - Shawn Mendes, Khalid

Here I am, stuck on this couch 
Scrolling through my notes 
Heart was broken, still not growing, nah 

Waking up to headlines 
Filled with devastation again 
My heart is broken 
But I keep going 

[Pre-Chorus: Khalid & Shawn Mendes] 
Pain, but I won't let it turn into hate 
No, I won't let it change me 
Never losing sight of the one I keep inside 
Now, I know it 
Yeah, I know it 




[Chorus: Khalid & Shawn Mendes] 
You can't take my youth away 
This soul of mine will never break 
As long as I wake up today 
You can't take my youth away 

You can't take my youth away 
This soul of mine will never break 
As long as I wake up today 
You can't take my youth away 
You can't take my youth away 

[Verse 2: Khalid & Shawn Mendes] 
It's hard to sleep at night 
Knowing what's outside 
Feeling hopeless 
I need focus 




You hit me with words I never heard come out your mouth 
To be honest 
I don't want it, no 

[Pre-Chorus: Khalid & Shawn Mendes] 
Pain, but I won't let it turn into hate 
No, I won't let it change me 

[Chorus: Khalid & Shawn Mendes] 
You can't take my youth away 
This soul of mine will never break 
As long as I wake up today 
You can't take my youth away 




You can't take my youth away 
This soul of mine will never break 
As long as I wake up today 
You can't take my youth away 
You can't take my youth away 

[Bridge: Khalid & Shawn Mendes] 
You can't take my youth away 
Pain, but I won't let it turn into hate 
No, I won't let it change me 
Pain, but I won't let it turn into hate 
No, I won't let it change me 

[Chorus: Khalid & Shawn Mendes] 
You can't take my youth away 
This soul of mine will never break 
As long as I wake up today 
You can't take my youth away (youth away) 




You can't take my youth away 
This soul of mine will never break 
As long as I wake up today 
You can't take my youth away 

You can't take my youth away 
This soul of mine will never break 
As long as I wake up today 
You can't take my youth away 

You can't take my youth away 
This soul of mine will never break 
As long as I wake up today 
You can't take my youth away 
You can't take my youth away
