Title: Spaceship
Mother said
Get me out
Brother meant
Get me out
I got a spaceship in the yard
We\\\\\\\'re only fourteen years apart
Or am I lost beside the stream
Tattoo my head tattoo my feet
I will leave home
lalalalalala~~~~~~~~~
I will leave home
Horseindasky
Through the vision valley waitin\\\\\\\' to be found
