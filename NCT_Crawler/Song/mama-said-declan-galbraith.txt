                        I couldn't sleep last night, there was something on my mind
I lay there wishin' in the dark, someone could tell me why.
If you love somebody from the bottom of your heart.
Why do you hurt each other. How does it fall apart.
An' then I heard a voice, as she sat down on my bed.
And I can still remember the words my mamma said.

Chorus:
Love can give, love can take, love can bend and love can break.
When you think it's over, it's not the end. Don't give in, just be strong.
And please remember son, my mamma said.
There ain't no broken heart love cannot mend.

My mamma said no one knows what your life has got in store.
You may go walking on the Moon, you may be rich or poor.
But I know for certain, if you try to reach the stars.
Anything is possible, your dreams are what you are.
But when it comes to matters of the heart there is no guarantees.
All that I can say to you is what my mamma said to me.

CHORUS
Love can give, love can take, love can bend and love can break.
When you think it's over, it's not the end. Don't give in, just be strong.
And please remember son, my mamma said.
There ain't no broken heart love cannot mend.

So one day in my lifetime, when my world falls apart.
I won't cry, I'll just tell my heart, my heart. . . . .

Chorus:

Love can give, love can take, love can bend and love can break.
When you think it's over, it's not the end. Don't give in, just be strong.
And please remember son, my mamma said.
There ain't no broken heart love cannot mend.

There ain't no broken heart love cannot mend.
                        
                    |
