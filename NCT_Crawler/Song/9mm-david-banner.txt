 Konvict music... Akon n david banner
 If niggas wanna ride tonight, best beleive we bout to ride tonight yeah
 Young money, cash money

 [Chorus: x2]
 I got a 9 mm
 Ready to go off any minute
 So you feel it
 Because of a law I had to conseal it
 If you *** around you gon make me reveal it

 [Lil wayne:]
 Tool on deck
 Why would I lie
 Nigga you a pussy
 Hope you got 9 lives
 I could hit a nigga wit the 9.-9 times
 Country ass boy
 Country like leanne rimes
 Mississippi d-banner
 And lil-weezy-anna
 Everybody got tools
 So you will need a hammer
 I'm a pill poppin animal
 Syrup sipping nigga
 I'm so high you couldn't reach me wit a ***ing antenna
 Your ***ing wit this man
 You can be this man dinner
 The 9 give me brains
 But the ak add lever
 The rapper is insane
 Flowing like a mad river
 Make your ass quiver
 Like you nekkad at winter
 Hollygrove honcho
 Hard time giver
 I'm a shark in the water
 You just long john silver
 I got a girl
 You want to meet her
 Her name is 9 millimeterrrrr

 [Chorus x2]

 [David banner:]
 If I got 9 slugs, 9 bullets gon fly
 If I got a red beam, 9 people gon die
 9 momma's gon cry, 9 spirits in the sky
 9 preachers preachin, 9 sermons tellin 9 lies
 Cause each and every one of yall 9 nigga's wasn't ***
 I would of rather kept the 9 lugers in the ruger clip
 The index finga slip I let the 9 spit
 I lick em all like 18 tits on 9 chicks
 I'm a suicide risk, 9 slits on each wrist
 If I died 9 times, the next go arounds a bitch
 And if I come back I throw 99 souls
 And shove 9 inches of dick in 99 hoes yall

 [Chorus x2]

 [Snoop Dogg:]
 Ima west coast original, black john wayne
 Nigga where we from we like to pop that thang
 Hey you better stop that man,
 Fat mouth the dawg and imma pop, pop, bang
 Pigs wanna bust me, hoes wanna suck me
 Nigga's wanna touch me, none of that trust me
 I'm too slick to slide, never snitch I let it ride
 I set aside, all my feelins when I'm killin, like a villian
 Move quick like a cheetah, imma killa
 I aint here to lock up, I flash the heata and then lock ya whole block up
 Dip dop deeta, banner turn the beat up,
 Illa for realla my nilla deal another card
 You niggas always actin hard,
 I keep a 9 mm in my waist and got two more in the car
 Yeah you all bout to get so quit it,
 Tryin to conseal it you *** around and make me reveal it so kill it skillet

 [Chorus: until end]
