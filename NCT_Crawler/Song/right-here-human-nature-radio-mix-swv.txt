                        Lately there seems to be
 Some insecurities
 About the way I feel
 Where I wanna be
 Boy ya know it's with you
 No one can do
 The things you do to me

 Never to be mistaken
 Long as it's love we're making
 There's gonna be some rain
 Gonna be some pain
 But as long as I know
 Boy time will show
 Our love will grow
 And I know

 (Chorus:)
 Love will be right here
 Be right here
 Right here
 Be right here
 No fear
 Have no fear
 No tears
 Love is here

 True love some don't believe in
 That's just what I'm givin'
 I'm gonna keep it strong
 I'll be holding on to you
 No one can do me like you do
 It's true

 Sure as the sun is shining
 Our love will keep on climbing
 There's gonna be some rain
 Gonna be some pain
 But as long as I know
 Boy time will show
 Our love will grow
 And I know

 [Chorus:]

 Swv (x 3)

 Love will be right here
 Be right here
 Right here right here
 Be right here
 Be right here

 No fear
 No fear
 Have no fear

 No tears
 Love is here
 Love's gonna be right here
 Right here
 Be right here
 Right here right here
 No fear
 Have no fear
 No tears
 Love's gonna be right here
                        
                    |
