                        Bài hát: Show Me Love (America) - The Wanted 

You should've known I love you 
Though I'll never say it too much 
Maybe you didn't get me 
Maybe I'll never know what I done 

Now I'm lost in the distance 
You look at me like a stranger 
Cause how it looks right to me 
That you were scared of the danger 

I could've shown you America 
All the bright lights in the universe 
We could have reached, the highest heights 
A different place, a different life 
Remember that night underneath the stars 
For a minute I thought the world was ours 
All you had to do was show me love 

Yeah it's true you know, we're not perfect 
There's a fire inside of me 
It means I'll fight for the things that are worth it 
If it makes me feel complete 
Cause I'm hitting rocks, and I'm taking shots 
I'm prepared to lose everything I've got 

Now I'm lost in the distance 
You look at me like a stranger 
Cause how it looks right to me 
That nothing can save us 

I could've shown you America 
All the bright lights in the universe 
We could have reached, the highest heights 
A different place, a different life 
Remember that night underneath the stars 
For a minute I thought the world was ours 
All you had to do was show me love 

Show me love, love 
Show me love, love 
Show me love, show me show me love... 
Show me show me love... 
Show me love 

I could've shown you America 
All the bright lights in the universe 
We could have reached, the highest heights 
A different place, a different life 
Remember that night underneath the stars 
For a minute I thought the world was ours 
All you had to do was show me love 

All you had to do was show me love
                        
                    |
