                        Bài hát: Un Poco Loco - Anthony Gonzalez, Gael Garcia Bernal

What color is the sky?
Ay mi amor, ay mi amor
You tell me that it's red
Ay mi amor, ay mi amor
Where should I put my Shoes?
Ay mi amor, ay mi amor

You say put them on your head
Ay mi amor, ay mi armor
You make me un poco loco
Un poqui-ti-ti-to loco
The way you keep me guessing

I'm nodding and I'm yessing
I'll count it as a blessing
That I'm only un poco loco
The loco that you make me
It's just un poco crazy

The sense that you're not making
The liberties you're taking
Leaves my cabeza shaking
You are just un poco loco
Un poqui-ti-ti-ti-ti-ti-ti-ti-ti
Ti-ti-ti-ti-to loco
                        
                    |
