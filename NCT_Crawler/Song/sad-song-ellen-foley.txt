                        It's a sad song
 When love goes wrong
 Leaves you feeling
 Like you never felt before
 Don't it hurt you
 And introvert you
 Leave you bleeding
 Feel so low and insecure Broken hearted melody
 Oh what have you done to me?
 I feel that time alone can say
 Where I'll end up now What a sad song
 When loves goes wrong
 Leaves you feeling
 That you never felt before
 Don't it shake you
 Almost break you
 Send you reeling
 Til your rolling out of love Broken hearted melody
 Oh what have you done to me?
 I feel that time alone can say
 Where I'll end up now
 (Oh won't you save me) Shalala... Shalala...
 Shalala... Shalala...
 Shalala... Shalala...
 Shalala... Shalala... Broken hearted melody
 Oh what have you done to me?
 I feel that time alone can say
 Where I'll end up now What a sad song (broken hearted melody)
 When love goes wrong (oh what have you done to me)
 Leaves you feeling (broken hearted melody)
 Like you never felt before (oh what have you done to me)
 Don't it shake you (broken hearted melody)
 Almost break you (oh what have you done to me)
 Send you reeling (broken hearted melody)
 Til your rolling out of love (oh what have you done to me)
