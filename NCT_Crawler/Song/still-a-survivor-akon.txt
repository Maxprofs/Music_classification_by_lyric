                        Title: Still A Survivor
Artist: Akon

Yeah eh ehhh
still a rider
a soul survivor


Your back is up against the wall
and there's no way to turn
you can feel the heat from the fire burn
there's no where to run and your down to the wire
remember that you still a rider (still a rider)
still a survivor (a soul survivor)
Remember that you still a rider


And that's all i ever been known that b
most stop from running
saying their licensed
saying you know what i got that thang on me

tryna pop that and plus stain on me
pretty young case stayed thang on me

if they go down in history

nigga don't forget to leave me a rider
even though we struggling
tryna find ways to doubling

girls on the hunt thinking we bubbling
funny how people love it when
i come in when the taylors fumbling
if we keep on stumbling

we end up more then just struggling
survivor

that's what i'll always be
might of have to move kammy
but believe money that am still sucker free
(AK) i low em down
(8K) i throw down
(state k) i closed down
so what do you do when


Your back is up against the wall
and there's no way to turn
you can feel the heat from the fire burn
there's no where to run and your down to the wire
remember that your still a rider (still a rider)
still a survivor (a soul survivor)
Remember that your still a rider


Just like my niggas that really never made it home
and being honest they gettin that money
trying their best to get feed their family

no matter what hustle going
we'll find a way to get up on it
gotta put that muscle on and stand on and on till the moring
rider
like everybody in the hood
really when nobody thought you could
i see you my nigga whats good?
rippin leather and wood
9 Milli meter hidden by that hood
get teristic leave for the ball
like the motto they riding for
survivor

that's what ill always be
might have to move kammy
but believe money that am still sucker free
(AK) i low em down
(8K) i throw down
(state k) i closed down
so what do you do when

Your back is up against the wall
and there's no way to turn
you can feel the heat from the fire burn
there's no where to run and your down to the wire
remember that your still a rider (still a rider)
still a survivor (a soul survivor)
Remember that your still a rider


Keep on riding and do what you gotta to keep on surviving
Keep on riding and do what you gotta to keep on providing
