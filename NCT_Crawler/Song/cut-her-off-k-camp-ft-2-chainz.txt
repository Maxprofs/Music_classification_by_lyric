(Intro)
It ain’t nothing to cut that bitch off
It ain’t nothing to cut that bitch off

So what you saying ho?
You Know I’m the man ho?
Nothing but a bird I’mma leave you where you stand, ho
Heard you got a man ho
Hope he understand though
You ain’t nothing but a creeper, I’m just saying, though
Saying, though

It ain’t nothing to cut that bitch off
It ain’t nothing to cut that bitch off

(Verse)
Creeping on the low, hope your man don’t see
She will bust it down for some damn limeritas
Chew me like some bubblegum, something like Rasheeda
Gotta get my partner some, she on me like Adidas
Baby, you can’t hold back, better stop flexing like you not
Your man tryna patrol then I guess he is a cop
But he really can’t cuff if he busting at my spot
But I done had enough cause you making my *** hot
Blowing up a nigga phone, what I tell yo ass ’bout that?
Tryna hold something, hold my nuts, can you do that?
Can be play around with that mouth while he hit it from the back?
You can’t say nothing now cause we all been through that, through that

(Hook)
It ain’t nothing to cut that bitch off
It ain’t nothing to cut that bitch off

So what you saying, ho?
You Know I’m the man, ho?
So what you saying, ho?
You Know I’m the man, ho?

(Verse: 2 Chainz)
You know that ain’t a real bad bitch, that’s a knockoff!
When I get to work I get to juggin like hot sauce
Outdoor like front,
Hit her from the back, real ranger lace front, stuntin
Tattoos on my neck and on my kidneys
If I don’t like that hoe I turn her ass into a Frisbee
If I don’t like yo *** I turn that hoe into a Frisbee
I’ll throw it out with O’s, man right by the Wendy’s
3 cellphones and all of em jumpin
I can see yo hoes and all of em nothing
Yea I’m don Don Cheadle, them cornelias watch the don spill
Pockets fat as don, call her Tina, make a done deal

(Hook)
It ain’t nothing to cut that bitch off
It ain’t nothing to cut that bitch off

So what you saying, ho?
You Know I’m the man, ho?
So what you saying, ho?
You Know I’m the man, ho?

(Verse)
Baby I’m ashamed, why you acting this way?
If she ’bout that action, you can bring her this way
Hit her on yo mattress, make you feel some type of way
Pass her to my migos, they gonna bust it, ¡Andale!
Please don’t play no games cause I know thats what you like
Knock it off the frame, baby girl, it’s alright
Yeah that pussy bomb, I just call it dynamite
You ready? Here I come, I can do this *** all night

(Hook)
It ain’t nothing to cut that bitch off
It ain’t nothing to cut that bitch off

So what you saying, ho?
You Know I’m the man, ho?
Nothing but a bird, I’mma leave you where you stand, ho
Heard you got a man, ho
Hope he understand, though
You ain’t nothing but a creeper, Baby I’m just saying though
Saying though

(Outro)
It ain’t nothing to cut that bitch off (Cut That Bitch Off, Cut That Bitch Off)
It ain’t nothing to cut that bitch off
