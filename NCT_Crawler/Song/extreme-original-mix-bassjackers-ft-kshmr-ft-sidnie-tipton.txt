[Verse]
Bottles getting low, bodies getting high
In the neon lights and the pink sky
I don't even know where you've been before
But I'll make it like it's your first time, your first time

[Pre-Chorus]
Cause you've got something bright
In those dark eyes
Mess me up, just please
Don't apologize
[Chorus]
I like it extreme, even more than you like it in your dreams
So just take me, take me to extremes
Only you know exactly what I mean
So just take me, take me

[Drop]
And you know that I like it
And you know, and you know, and you know

Baby take me to extremes
Only you, only you, only you know

And you know that I like it
And you know, and you know, and you know

Baby take me to extremes
Only you, only you, only you know

[Verse]
Bottles getting low, bodies getting high
In the neon lights and the pink sky
I don't even know where you've been before
But I'll make it like it's your first time, your first time

[Pre-Chorus]
Cause you've got something bright
In those dark eyes
Mess me up just please
Don't apologize

[Chorus]
I like it extreme even more than you like it in your dreams
So just take me, take me to extremes
Only you know exactly what I mean
So just take me, take me

[Drop]
And you know that I like it
And you know, and you know, and you know

Baby take me to extremes
Only you, only you, only you know

And you know that I like it
And you know, and you know, and you know

Baby take me to extremes

[Pre-Chorus]
Cause you've got something bright
In those dark eyes
Mess me up just please
Don't apologize

[Chorus]
I like it extreme even more than you like it in your dreams
So just take me, take me to extremes
Only you know exactly what I mean
So just take me, take me
