                        Bài hát : After The Sunrise - Yanni

Carly Simon
Playing Possum
After The Storm
(carly simon)

Heat's up, tea's brewed
Clothes strewn around the room
Looks like a wind swept through
Made a wild man out of you
And doesn't anger turn you on
And expectation of a calm
After the storm
And your body feels so warm
After the storm

The wind's pulling the moon down
Under the eiderdown
You're taking me to town
And you're tossing me around
You come on like a hurricane
I'm settling like youre weathervane
After the storm
And your body feels so warm
After the storm
                        
                    |
