I know I believed in you I did but to me
We are over now all the times
We were together yeah
Let’s go

Baby one more time
Let me blow your mind

Only fantasy I’ll start the Showtime just for you
Indulge in me, soft like sweet chocolate

With sexy stares and hot body language come on closer
Nasty wolves that are up all night come hold me

Baby one more time
Let me blow your mind

Baby come to me I can’t handle it, toxic in your direction
Get drunk on me, soaked like pink lipstick

Fix my makeup Oh wet my throat all the dancing people
Sometimes Tight sometimes Art take me

Baby one more time
Let me blow your mind
-- 
You can’t stop me here
Try to release yourself from me
The chains around your heart
Push them inside
(THIS PART REALLY DOESN’T MAKE SENSE!!)

We can take it slow
Anyway you wanna go
I like this music don’t stop moving
Dance into the night
Hit me boy
Baby don’t be shy
Come by my side
Baby hold me tight
I wanna make you mine

One more time

Baby one more time
Let me blow your mind

Baby one more time
Don’t stop me
So I can tempt these times of ecstasy

Let me blow your mind
Hold me again
So it never stops
