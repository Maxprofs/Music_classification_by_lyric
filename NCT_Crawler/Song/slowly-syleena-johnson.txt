                        When he first walked through the door
 I had this feeling that I never felt before
 He was the finest thing I've ever seen
 He had me trippin' just 'cause he smiled at me And he kissed me softly on my cheek
 Said to me, "You smell good enough to eat"
 Girl, I swear my heart must've skipped a beat
 He's got me feeling like I did when I was seventeen (But I couldn't wait)
 For him to put his hands all over me
 (So I'm getting warm and I'm waiting)
 For him to make love to me
 (Slowly) Then slowly he undressed me
 Then slowly he laid me down
 Pulled my panties down
 Then slowly he went down on me
 Then slowly we made love Ohh, been an hour
 Since his love had been in me
 Couldn't believe he felt this good inside of me
 It was everything I dreamed that it would be
 And like a virgin, I was tight but he loosened me Then slowly, he began to speak
 "You're so good, baby"
 That's what he said to me
 Girl, I'm telling you that this one is the truth
 Put it on me like a real man is s'pose to (And I couldn't wait)
 To feel him come inside of me
 ('Cause he wasn't selfish, he was patient)
 Ohh, ooh
 Girl, he made love to me
 But slowly Then slowly he undressed me
 Then slowly he laid me down
 Pulled my panties down
 Then slowly he went down on me
 Then slowly we made love Ooh
 (We made love)
 To the steady rhythm of my heart beats
 (We made love)
 To the tears came down my face (We made love)
 Till it rained sunshine and the fall leaves turned to snow
 (We made love)
 He took my body through the four seasons (We made love)
 Till our spirits locked and wouldn't let go
 (We made love)
 Till our bodies couldn't come no more (We made love)
 Till the full moon became the sunlight's glow
 He filled my cup
 Till it over flowed, ohh ooh ooh Then slowly he undressed me
 Then slowly he laid me down
 Pulled my panties down
 Then slowly he went down on me
 Then slowly we made love
