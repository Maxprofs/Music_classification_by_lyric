                        Bài hát: Gimme! Gimme! Gimme! - V.A

Is there a man out there?
Someone to hear my prayer

Gimme gimme gimme, a man after midnight
Won't somebody help me chase these shadows away?
Gimme gimme gimme, a man after midnight
Take me through the darkness to the break of the day

Sorry to drag you away
God! Thank God you did!
This used to be a quiet little island
Regretting you stayed away so long?
I'm regretting I never knew what was here
What?
Well this place, you know, the [Incomprehensible]
I always meant to come back and build it someday
But she beat me to it
Well, do you prefer buildings to people?
What?

Tell me something about my mum
Your mum, well she was irresistible, oh she was one off
Well umm, we talked and we fought
You know it was me that brought her to this island
That wasn't the only thing you did, was it?
Alright, what's she told you?
Oh nothing, she's never mentioned you
But you said," Mum's always talking about a friend from the old days"
Whats going on, Sophie why am I here?

Is there a man out there?
Someone to hear my prayer

Gimme gimme gimme, a man after midnight
Won't somebody help me chase the shadows away?
Gimme gimme gimme, a man after midnight
Take me through the darkness to the break of the day

Fancy! Donna with a grown up daughter!
Have you got any children, Harry?
No, I haven't put myself in the path of paternity
It's never too late
I don't think my other half would agree
Oh you don't want children
Oh no no, its not that, its just that
Well, I would've liked a daughter, I'd have spoiled it to bits
Lucky thing
Is then, your dad here?
I don't know
What?
I don't know who my dad is

Is there a man out there?
Someone to hear my prayer

Can I be nosy? I am a writer so it goes with the territory
Go on
Well how did your mother get this place?
When I knew her, she was singing in a nightclub on the mainland
She was left some money in a will
We lived with an old lady when I was little, her name was Sophia
What, my great aunt Sophia?
I think it must be
Ah but I always heard her money went to family
Wait a minute, how old are you?
Twenty!

Gimme gimme gimme, a man after midnight
Won't somebody help me chase the shadows away?
Gimme gimme gimme, a man after midnight
Take me through the darkness to the break of the day
                        
                    |
