                        Verse 1
 Out of luck with love, but still I played the game
 Crossed the heart and hoped to God that it would change
 So many times, afraid to give my heart away
 That was before you came
 Showed me another way

 Bridge 1
 Close my eyes
 And tell myself that it's all right (its ok girl, it's ok girl)
 Do you feel the way I feel?
 Cause if I let you in
 Baby you can get the best of me

 Chorus
 The way that you love me, love me, love me
 Sgot me thinkin I'm ready, ready, ready
 When I couldn't see
 You know you made me believe that
 I'm ready for love
 The way that you love me, love me, love me
 Sgot me thinkin I'm ready, ready, ready
 Can't keep it inside
 Because you're doing it right
 And I'm ready for love

 Verse 2
 Resigned to me, myself and I but you flipped it
 Never thought that I would find something like this
 You stole my heart and ooh you got me good
 Keep doing what you do
 Coss I'm so in love with you

 Bridge 2
 Talk to me
 And tell me (sok girl, go ahead girl)
 Cause I'm laying down my cards
 And I'm putting down my guard
 Baby you can get the best of me

 Chorus

 Middle 8
 Hold up, wait a minute, want my love? Come get it, get it!
 (I'm ready for, I'm ready for love, I'm ready for, I'm ready for love)
 Said hold up, wait a minute, want my love? Come get it, get it!
 (I'm ready for, I'm ready for love, I'm ready for, I'm ready for love)
 Said hold up, wait a minute, want my love? Come get it, get it!
 (I'm ready for, I'm ready for love, I'm ready for, I'm ready for love)

 Bridge 3
 Close my eyes
 And tell myself that it's all right (sok girl, go ahead girl)
 Cos I'm laying down my cards
 And I'm putting down my guard
 Baby you can get the best of me
                        
                    |
