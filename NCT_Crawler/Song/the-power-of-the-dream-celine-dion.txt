                        Song: The Power Of The Dream - Celine Dion

Deep within each heart 
There lies a magic spark 
That lights the fire for our imagintion 
And since the dwan of man A 
strength just I can 
Has brought together people of all nations 
There’s nothing ordinary 
In the living of each day 
There’s a special part everyone of us will play 

Feel the flame forever burn 
Teaching lessons we must learn 
To bring us close to the power of dream 
As the word gives us its best 
To spare the path for moment passed 
It’s the power of dream that brings us here 

Your mind will take you far 
The rest is just here 
You’ll find yo’ fate is all your own creatin 
And every boy and girl 
As they’re calling to this world 
To bring the gift to whole man inspriation 

Feel the flame forever burn 
Teaching lessons we must learn 
To bring us close to the power of dream 
The world you unites in hope and peace we pray 
That you will always be 
It’s the power of the dream that will bring us here 

There’s so much strength in all of us 
Every woman , child , man 
It’s the moment that you think you can’t
                        
                    |
