This is what you call a flip
Ten keys from a quarter brick
Bentley from his mama's whip
K.O.D., he hard as ***
This is what you call a flip
Ten keys from a quarter brick

Bentley from his mama's whip
K.O.D., he hard as ***
This is what you call a flip
Ten keys from a quarter brick
Bentley from his mama's whip

K.O.D., he hard as ***
This is what you call a flip
Ten keys from a quarter brick
Bentley from his mama's whip
K.O.D., he hard as ***
Wow, niggas been crampin' my style
Blowin' my high, they want a reply

The number one question is, "How?"
How does it feel now that you on?
How much you worth? How big is your home?
How come you won't get a few features?
I think you should? How 'bout I don't?

How 'bout you just get the *** off my dick?
How 'bout you listen and never forget?
Only gon' say this one time, then I'm dipped
Niggas ain't worthy to be on my ***
Haven't you heard? I'm as cold as the tip
Tip of the iceberg that tipped the Titanic

No tip-toein' 'round it, my *** is gigantic
It's big as the ***in' Atlantic, I'm lit, bitch
This is what you call a flip
Ten keys from a quarter brick
Bentley from his mama's whip
K.O.D., he hard as ***

This is what you call a flip
Ten keys from a quarter brick
Bentley from his mama's whip
K.O.D., he hard as ***
This is what you call a flip
Ten keys from a quarter brick

Bentley from his mama's whip
K.O.D., he hard as ***
This is what you call a flip
Ten keys from a quarter brick
Bentley from his mama's whip
K.O.D., he hard as ***

I grew up on the hue of the love
'Member I got my first view of the blood
I'm hangin' out and they shoot up the club
My homie got pharmaceutical plug
I smoke the drug and it run through my vein
I think it's workin' it's numbin' the pain

Don't give a *** and I'm somewhat insane
Don't give a *** and I'm somewhat insane
Yeah, at this *** daily, sipped so much Actavis
I convinced Actavis that they should pay me
If practice made perfect, I'm practice's baby

If practice made perfect, I'm practice's baby
Platinum wrist ridin' in back like Miss Daisy
Platinum disc and I own masters, bitch, pay me
Y'all niggas trappin' so lacksiyal daisy
My nigga sell crack like it's back in the '80s
Know a young nigga, he acting'so crazy

He serve a few packs and he jack a Mercedes
He shoot at the police, he clap at old ladies
He don't give a *** if them crackers gon' hang him
Bitches been askin', "Where have you done lately?"
I stacked a few M's like my last name was Shady
My life is too crazy, no actor could play me

My life is too crazy, no actor could play me
This is what you call a flip
Ten keys from a quarter brick
Bentley from his mama's whip
K.O.D., he hard as ***
This is what you call a flip

Ten keys from a quarter brick
Bentley from his mama's whip
K.O.D., he hard as ***
This is what you call a flip
Ten keys from a quarter brick
Bentley from his mama's whip

K.O.D., he hard as ***
This is what you call a flip
Ten keys from a quarter brick
Bentley from his mama's whip
K.O.D., he hard as ***

Power, greed
Money, Molly, weed
Percs, Xannys, lean, fame
And the strongest drug of them all
And the strongest drug of them all
Love
