Jordin Sparks - Let It Rain

shout it out
i can't hold back no more
i let it out
all these feelings that were
trapped inside
i was frozen evertime
i looked in your eyes
clear my head
from all the cluttered things
i should've said
that wasn't me
no i can't live like that
I'm waking up and there is no
looking back

Every little tear
i was scared to cry
everyting i feared
but i kept inside
i don't wanna hold
it back one more day
oh wash it away
every tiny thought clouding
up my head
every single word that
i never said
i refuse to feel ashamed
let it rain
let it rain

clear the sky
i start to breathe again
no-thing to hide
let you through to who
i am inside
every layer
'til you get underneath my skin
let you in, let you in

every little tear
i was scared to cry
everything i feard
but i kept inside
i dont wanna hold it back
one more day
oh wash it away
every tiny thought
clouding up my head
every single word that
i never said
i refuse to feel ashamed
let it rain
let it rain

other girls are suking side of me
make a boy make it believe
let it rain wash me clean
wash me clean
let it rain

every little tear
i was scared to cry
everything i feard
but i kept inside
i dont wanna hold it back
one more day
oh was it away
every tiny thought
clouding up my head
every single word that
i never said
i refuse to feel ashamed
let it rain
let it rain

wash me clean
wash me clean
