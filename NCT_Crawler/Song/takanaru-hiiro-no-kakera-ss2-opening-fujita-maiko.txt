                        *Itsukara darou
Anata no yubi ga
Kirei da to shitta no wa
Kono kimochi ni kizuita no wa

Hikarete iku hayasa ni
Tsuite ikenai kara
Okubyou na kokoro ga
BUREEKI wo kakeru yo

Futo me ga atte
...Nanika hanashite
Anata ni mitsumerareru to
Watashi wa ugokenaku naru

#Takanaru kodou de kowaresou
Tsukamareta ude hikiyoserarete
Osararenai tsutawaranai de
Anata wo suki da to
Kanjita itai hodo
Iki mo dekinai koi no hajimari

*Tomadou mama
Anata no ude no naka
Sotto me wo tojita
Korekara dou narun darou

Kizutsuku no wa kowai no ni
Suki ni narisugireba tsurai no ni
Mou dame dayo
Konna kimochi

Tsumetai kaze
...Kisetsu ga kawaru
Doushite nakisou ni naru
Kore ijou dakishimenai de

#Anata no egao ga itoshikute
Chikazuita koe fureta kankaku
Aki no yuugure ochiba ga matte
Hashiridashita koi
Kimochi wa tomaranai
Kanjiru omoi shinjite mo ii

**Hajimete koishii hito no
Kaori wo shitta sono toki ga
Itsumademo kienai
Shunkan ni naru

#Takanaru kodou de kowaresou
Tsukamareta ude hikiyoserarete
Osararenai tsutawaranai de
Anata wo suki da to
Kanjita itai hodo
Iki mo dekinai koi no hajimari

*Since when was it that
I'd known your fingers
were this beautiful?
When was it that I noticed these feelings?

Because I couldn't follow
when I was captivated at such an early instant,
my cowardly heart
broke the brake

Our eyes met by accident
...Just what should we say?
I become unable to move
whenever our eyes meet

#The heartbeat resounding highly sounds like it is breaking
I pulled close the arm that I grabbed
I'm unable to restrain it, so please don't say anything
When I realized that I loved you,
the feeling I felt was pain
It was the beginning of a love that would take my breath away

*While bewildered,
I slowly closed my eyes
when I was within your arms
Just what would become of us from now on?

Though I was afraid of hurting you,
though I knew that it would become painful if we were too much in love,
I can no longer hold back
these feelings of mine

The wind was cold
...The seasons changed
Why do I feel like crying?
Please don't embrace me anymore than this

#I love your smile
Your voice that's so close, the sensation of touching you
Within the autumn twilight, the fallen leaves danced
I can no longer stop my feelings,
this infatuation that rushed out
Is it fine for me to believe in those thoughts I felt from you?

**That moment when I knew of the scent
of the first person I loved
became an everlasting instant
that would never disappear

#The heartbeat resounding highly sounds like it is breaking
I pulled close the arm that I grabbed
I'm unable to restrain it, so please don't say anything
When I realized that I loved you,
the feeling I felt was pain
It was the beginning of a love that would take my breath away
                        
                    |
