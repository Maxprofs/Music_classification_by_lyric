                        Out in the rain, looking for sunshine
I call your name, but you’re like a ghost
I let you disappear, should’ve never let you go
I want to say just for the record
That you still got my heart and my soul
And though we’re worlds apart
Yeah, I gotta let you know
You are the piece I can’t replace, oh
You left a mark that won’t erase, oh

No one else can teach me how to love again
‘Cause you left a permanent stain on my heart and I’ve been feeling it
Never mind what people say ’cause they don’t understand
How you left a permanent stain on my heart, you're never leaving it

Some tried to break through the walls that
I built up, but they don’t compare to you
One chance, and I swear I’ll never let you go
You are the piece I can’t replace, oh
You left a mark that won’t erase, oh

No one else can teach me how to love again
‘Cause you left a permanent stain on my heart and I’ve been feeling it
Never mind what people say ’cause they don’t understand
How you left a permanent stain on my heart, you're never leaving it

Ooh ooh ooh ooh
You left a permanent stain on my heart, you're never leaving it

Wash away the tide
Never gonna fade, no one can touch the flame or tame the fire
You are the piece I can’t replace, oh
You left a mark that won’t erase, oh

No one else can teach me how to love again
‘Cause you left a permanent stain on my heart and I’ve been feeling it
Never mind what people say ’cause they don’t understand
How you left a permanent stain on my heart, you're never leaving it

Ooh ooh ooh ooh
You left a permanent stain on my heart, you're never leaving it
Ooh ooh ooh ooh
You left a permanent stain on my heart, you're never leaving it
