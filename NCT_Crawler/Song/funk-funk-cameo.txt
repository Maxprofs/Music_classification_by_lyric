                        Get up, we are eternal funk
 Alias the phemaldehyde funkmen
 You can't see us but you can feel us Get up on the funk, funk, funk, funk, funk, funk
 Feel it begin to rock, rock, rock, rock, rock, rock
 If you're tired of the same ol' sound
 Get up on the Cameo sound 'Cause we are living funk, funk, funk, funk, funk, funk
 Come on, dig the funky horns It is our will to let you know that we exist
 So don't resist
 Let it all hang out
 Huh, don't be a dead boogie, baby Yeah, dig my heavy drift, yeah, dig my heavy drift
 My drift's too hip to resist, my drift's too hip to resist
 To get off on is a trip, to get off on is a trip, funk, funk If you can do with me I can do with you
 Just like 2 supposed to do
 Hey, hey This sure ain't none of the P funk
 It's gettin' down on the C funk
 'Cause we are living funk, funk
 Funk, funk, funk, funky We can be funky as we want to be
 And can be funkier than that
 We were here before you felt the funk
 And we will be hear after the funky feelin's gone I'm stretchin' out on the floor, I'm stretchin' out on the floor
 It feels too good to ignore, it feels too good to ignore
 Sweats all over my face, baby, sweats all over my face
 It's a crazy place I'm breakin' out on the floor again, baby
 It feels too good to ignore
 Sweats all over my face
 Funk, funk, it's a crazy place
