                        Bài Hát: Top Of The World - Hòa Tấu, Piano

Such a felling coming over me
There is wonder in most everthing i see
Not a cloud in the sky
Got the sun in my eyes
And i won't be surprised if it's a dream.

Everything i want the world to be
Is now coming true especially for me
And the reason is clear
It's beause you are here.

You're the nearest thing to heaven that i've seen
I'm on the top of the world looking down on creation
And the only explanation i can find
Is the love that i've found ever since you've been around
Your love's put me at the top of the world.

Something in the wind has learned my name
And it's telling me that things are not the same 
In the leaves on the trees and the touch of the breeze
There's a pleasing sense of happiness for me.

There is only one wish on my mind
When this day is through i hope that i will find
That tomorrow will be just the same for you and me
All i need will be mine if you are here.

I'm on the top of the world lookin' down on creation
And the only explanation i can find
Is the love that i've found ever since you've been around
Your love's put me at the top of the world.
