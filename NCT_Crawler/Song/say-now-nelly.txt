                        Gun shots reigned out over the city
 And had everybody duckin' and runnin checkin' for any inda
 Shelter 'cause them peoples man they at it again
 If you aint heard or seen it then you better pretend
 Aint got no time for stoppin' ain't no catchin' your wind
 Ya baby mammas on the porch tellin' her daughters come in
 Got fathers grabbin' sons "where the hell have you been?"
 Boy and y'all just startin young I'm talkin 13 and 10
 They started tranin' in the streets some type of ghetto battles
 But they ain't hoopin in the gym they hoopin crates in the alleys
 Where else can you shoot a jump shot
 Slang a rock all from the same spot?
 Got one gang on this half
 The other gang on the other half of the same block
 Gunplay on Monday
 Sundays a fun day
 Will it stop one day?
 I can't call it no way
 When your gettin' started everybody wanna help and get you off
 But turn around first motherfuckers wanna see you fall Say now (say now)
 Can you hoes come out to play now? (Play now)

 Wait a minute na, oh Feel like I'm runnin towards the daylight
 Tryin ta get my mind right
 And just before I grab it somebody reach out and snatch it from me

 Play now, yeah Oh hear me out Uh uh (check it)
 Uh uh uh (you check it)
 Uh uh Trynna put my
 City on the map and they mad at me
 The same city some of them live in and they mad at me
 When I come down to speak dirty why you mad at me?
 Is it 'cause the old school freaked out niggas from A to Z?
 Ain't CDs, Tvs, our aim's to please
 They mean the same to me like Biggie to C's
 Like Easy to E's, Tupac to overseas
 And I done see more Aaliyah fans fall cry to their knees
 I tell ya, I aint been livin' this life for too long
 And I can't count how many times someone has asked me what's wrong
 Why my mother was gone
 Why my daddy wasn't home
 And the same *** they told me I found myself tellin my own
 Now it's good-bye bad nights
 Hello good times
 There ain't no way I'll let no nigga step in my shine
 Keep tryin' (you keep tryin')
 There's bound ta be somethin' G
