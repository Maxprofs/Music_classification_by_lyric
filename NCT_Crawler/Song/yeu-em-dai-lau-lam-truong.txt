                        Bài hát: Yêu Em Dài Lâu - Lam Trường

Although loneliness has always been a friend the mine
I'm leaving my life in your hand
People say I'm crazy and that I am blind
Risking it all in a glance.

How you got me blind is still a mystery
I can't get you out of my head
Don't care what is read in your history
As long as you're here with me

I don't care who you are
Where you're from
What you did
As long as you love me.

Who you are
Where you're from
Don't care what you did
As long as you love me.

Hứa đi em theo anh đôi ta cùng về suối mơ
Vòng hoa uyên ương anh trao đến em
Nghĩ suy chi xin em, xin em đừng từ chối anh
Và xin em đừng trách anh vội vàng.

Người yêu ơi! 
Thôi xin em
Không lo âu
Ta yêu nhau
Dài lâu cho đến mai sau.

Thôi xin em 
Không lo âu
Tình anh không phai đâu
Dài lâu cho đến mai sau.

As long as you love me!

I've tried to hide it so that no one knows
But I guess it shows
When you look into my eyes.

What you did and where you're comin from
I don't care, as long as you love me, baby.

I don't care who you are (who you are)
Where you're from (where you're from)
What you did
As long as you love me (as long as you love me).

Who you are (who you are)
Where you're from (where you're from)
Don't care what you did (yeah.

As long as you love me (as long as you love me)
Who you are (who you are)
Where you're from
What you did
As long as you love me.

Who you are (who you are)
Where you're from (where you're from)
As long as you love me
Who you are
As long as you love me
What you did (I don't care)
As long as you love me.
