                        I'ma do it, do it
Like I wanna do it
You gon' know me like, you ain't never know me before
I'ma bring it, bring it
I'ma give it, give it
You gon' love me like you ain't love nobody before
Hello, hello, hello, hello
Hello, hello, hello, hello
Hello, hello, hello, hello
You gon' love me like you ain't love nobody before
Too nice,Too clean Too white, Too green Little haters, big dreams
I don't care what you think about me (uh!)
Two face Old friends, Told me, The end, Whats near (ha!) Forget them
See a lot of things changed since then
Don't they know that I came from Nebraska
Am I gonna quit?
Nice of you to ask, but
Momma told me go and chase what you're after
I'm on track, so I'mma rap faster
I'mma break it down for you and get a little deeper,
Slayin' on it prayin' on it like a grim reaper,
Runnin' up the theremometer yup, I got a fever
Hi, konichiwa, are you a believer?
I'mma do it, do it
Like I wanna do it
You gon' know me like, you ain't never know me before
I'ma bring it, bring it
I'ma give it, give it
You gon' love me like you ain't love nobody before
Hello, hello, hello, hello
Hello, hello, hello, hello
Hello, hello, hello, hello
You gon' love me like you ain't love nobody before

Too hard,Too soft Too rough,Too posh
Lemme do, What I want
Lace it up baby, tie it in a knot (uh!)
Race track, Two legs Hollywood, Big break Suck it up, Intake
Let me tell you how it happened real quick (oh!)
Touch down in the middle of the city,
Mass ave. stt jam up to Newbury,
Million Dollar party now
Tell me who you wearin'
Lotsa new hand held hype you can carry
I'mma break it down for you and get a little deeper,
Slayin' on it Prayin' on it like a grim reaper,
Runnin' up theremometer yup, I got a fever
Hi, konichiwa, very nice to meetcha!
I'ma do it, do it
Like I wanna do it
You gon' know me like, you ain't never know me before
I'ma bring it, bring it
I'ma give it, give it
You gon' love me like you ain't love nobody before
Hello, hello, hello, hello
Hello, hello, hello, hello
Hello, hello, hello, hello
You gon' love me like you ain't love nobody before
Let me keep going,
Baby till I'm dead and gone
That's my only wish
And if you don't know,
I'll be singin' my song
I got a lot to give
Ohh
I'ma do it, do it
Like I wanna do it
You gon' know me like, you ain't never know me before
I'ma bring it, bring it
I'ma give it, give it
You gon' love me like you ain't love nobody before
Hello, hello, hello, hello
Hello, hello, hello, hello
Hello, hello, hello, hello
You gon' love me like you ain't love nobody before
Hello, hello, hello, hello
Hello, hello, hello, hello
Hello, hello, hello, hello
You gon' love me like you ain't love nobody before
