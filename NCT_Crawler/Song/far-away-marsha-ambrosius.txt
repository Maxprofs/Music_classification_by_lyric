                        So sad to see you go so soon
 I know that you ain't coming back
 In the beginning everything was cool
 Toward the end of it all, it's all bad I know I played my part in making it what it is
 And I know that you did the same
 I guess I'm up outta here, I'm moving on again
 I'm sure that you will understand I played by the rules, you played by the game
 I couldn't have stayed, it's easier to say
 'Cause I was by your side when you went through the pain
 I guess it doesn't matter now that you're so far away And every minute you're gone I'm missing you so
 I can't believe that you're far away
 Can't get you outta my mind, boy you're outta my life
 I can't believe that you're far away And it would be different if you could hear me baby
 Now that you're so far away
 Didn't want you to go babe, babe Ooh, tears stains on my pillow tryna forget you
 Don't know what I'm gonna do
 Four days and counting, I been laying here
 Staring myself in the mirror all alone in my room I can't feel this way again, gonna think with my head
 'Cause my heart is what got me here
 So hurt from what you done
 More than enough reasons for me to move on 'Cause I gave you my word, you put your trust in me
 Supposed to be the one to give you what you need
 I was by your side when we were meant to be
 I guess it doesn't matter now that you're so far away And every minute you're gone I'm missing you so
 I can't believe that you're far away
 Can't get you outta my mind, boy you're outta my life
 I can't believe that you're far away And it would be different if you could hear me baby
 Now that you're so far away
 Didn't want you to go If I'd have known Sunday morning that you would be gone
 I wouldn't ever come home
 I wouldn't have answered my phone to hear the voice had a tone
 I knew that something was wrong The cop's the one who had told me that you was alone
 Inside an empty room
 Identified you as my baby
 Oh my baby, so far away And every minute you're gone I'm missing you so
 I can't believe that you're far away
 Can't get you outta my mind, boy you're outta my life
 I can't believe that you're far away And it would be different if you could hear me baby
 Now that you're so far away
 Can't believe that you're gone
