                        Bài hát : What Is Love - Janelle Monáe

What is love
If it's not with you,
I know when you're alone you feel it too.
In your arms is where I long to be,
'Cause being with you gives me sanity. (Hey!)

(Oohh)

Listen to me darling,
I wake up every morning
Thinking 'bout the way you feel.

(Oohh)

I wonder if you know it,
And what good is the party
If you're not around?
Listen to me now.

What good is love (This is a crazy love)
If it's not your love (It's an amazing love)
What good is love (It's an amazing love)
If it's not your love (It's an amazing love)

What's a song,
If you can't hear it too?
Can't imagine dancing without you.
A shooting star ain't really nothing to see,
If you're not right here standing next to me. (Hey!)

(Oohh)

Listen to me darling,
I wake up every morning
Thinking 'bout the way you feel.

(Oohh)

I wonder if you know it,
And what good is the party
If you're not around?
Listen to me now.

What good is love (This is a crazy love)
If it's not your love (It's an amazing love)
What good is love (It's an amazing love)
If it's not your love (It's an amazing love)

(Whoaa)

What is love
If it's not with you,
I know when you're alone you feel it too.
In your arms is where I long to be,
'Cause being with you gives me sanity. (Hey!)

(Oohh)

Listen to me darling,
I wake up every morning
Thinking 'bout the way you feel.

(Oohh)

I wonder if you know it,
And what good is the party
If you're not around?
Listen to me now.

What good is love (This is a crazy love)
If it's not your love (It's an amazing love)
What good is love 
If it's not your love

What's the song? 
What's the word?
In this love with you? (It's an amazing love)
If it is not with you, (It's an amazing love)
If you came here too. (It's an amazing love)

(Oohh)

I know when you're alone,
You've got to feel it too!
Ho, yeah, oh, yeah
What is love!
Listen to me darling!
What is love if it's not with you?
