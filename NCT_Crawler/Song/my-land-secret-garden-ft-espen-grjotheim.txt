                        My land
Secret Garden..Albums: Inside I'm singing

How green are your valley
How blue your great sky
Your mountain stands tall in their glory
The river runs free
The bright stars are your eyes.
Your beauty is endless before me.

* chorus: 

For you are the songs ever singing in me
And you are the heart ever true.
For you are my land and you always will be.
The voices ever calling me home to you.

When to your green valley some day I'll return
When you lay your mantle around me
At rest I will be where the heart will not yearn
My land will ever surround me.

repeat *chorus
