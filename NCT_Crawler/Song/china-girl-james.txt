                        She said, "Jimmy, just you shut your mouth"
 She said, "Shh" I could escape this feeling with my China girl
 I am just a wreck without my little China girl
 I hear her heart beat 'loud as thunder
 I see stars crashing down I'm a mess without my China girl
 Wake up mornings there's no China girl
 I hear hearts beating 'loud as thunder
 I see stars crashing down I feel a tragic like I was Marlon Brando
 When I look at my China girl
 I could pretend that nothing really meant too much
 When I look at my China girl I stumble into town just like a sacred cow
 Visions of swastikas in my head
 Plans for everyone
 It's in the white of my eyes My little China girl
 You shouldn't mess with me
 I'll ruin everything you are I'll give you television
 I'll give you eyes of blue
 I'll give you men
 Who want to rule the world And when I get excited
 My little China girl says
 "Oh, dear, just you shut your mouth"
 She says, "Shh"
 She says, "Shh"
 She says, "Shh"
