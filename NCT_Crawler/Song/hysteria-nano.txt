                        Bài hát : Hysteria - Nano

All of these cuts and bruises that will fade away
I act as if they've made me that much wiser
Another night I sink into my lonely bed
To shut out every sound as I scream inside my head
And like a turning wheel the time keeps moving on
The pain from yesterday is now just so long gone
And as I fall into another aching sleep
The crying voice I keep on hearing echoes deep

It's every shameful fall, every mistake that I've made
These are the scars that have brought me where I am today
Another false conception that I fed myself to escape reality
The only lie I see is now inside of my head
The only truth slips through my fingertips in the end
Let me keep on dreaming as I watch the days just pass me on by

I turn another page of my biography
And all the mysteries begin to fall in place
I wonder why I wasted so much precious time
I'd never find my life inside this cluttered room

I'm letting go today

They try to measure the depths of all the scars that we have
And try to prove to us that life could be so much more
But if you'd only stop and take a look around
You'd know we're all the same
And as I keep repeating all the days in my head
It's like endless movie that has no happy end
But the scene goes on without an answer and I will cry

It's every shameful fall, every mistake that I've made
These are the scars that have brought me where I am today
Another false conception that I fed myself to escape reality
The only lie I see is now inside of my head
The only truth slips through my fingertips in the end
Let me keep on dreaming as I watch the days just pass me on by
                        
                    |
