English translation lyrics
Don’t cross your legs, don’t cross your legs
Don’t cross your legs, don’t cross your legs
Don’t cross your legs, don’t cross your legs

You showed me chic and provoked my instincts
I didn’t think about the consequences and lifted up my leg and crossed it over my opposite leg, it was nauseating
What is this feeling of my leg falling asleep and my blood not circulating?

You showed me snobby and provoked my instincts
I clenched my firsts and banged my desk so everyone focused on me, then i crossed my legs, it was all twisted up
What is this feeling that my growth plates are closing up starting with my toes?

At your rash and haughty behavior
At your eyes, that say “i’m the truth”
A pointless competitive spirit burns up in me so i spread out my short legs and crossed them

(rap)
When i go out to the city, i see colorful, thick or thin kinds of skirts and pants here and there
Out of those, i see bewitching legs that stand out
You cross your legs and sit on a bench, with a nervous face that seems like you’re waiting for someone
But it’s not like that so are you doing that because your legs fell asleep?

Don’t cross your legs, don’t cross your legs
Don’t cross your legs, don’t cross your legs
Don’t cross your legs, don’t cross your legs
Don’t cross your legs, all of you

Don’t cross your legs, don’t cross your legs
Don’t cross your legs, don’t cross your legs
Don’t cross your legs, don’t cross your legs
