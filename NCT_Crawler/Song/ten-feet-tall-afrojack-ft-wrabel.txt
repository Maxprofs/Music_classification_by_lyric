                        Bài hát: Ten Feet Tall - Afrojack, Wrabel

I'm clumsy
And my head's a mess
Cause you got me growing taller everyday
We're giants in a little man's world
My heart is pumping up so big that it could burst

Been trying so hard not to let it show
But you got me feeling like
I'm stepping on buildings, cars and boats
I swear I could touch the sky

Ohhh ohh ohhh
I'm ten feet tall
Ohhh oh ohhhh
I'm ten feet tall


I'll be careful
So don't be afraid
You're safe here
No these arms won't let you break
I'll put up a sign in the clouds
So they all know that we ain't ever coming down

Been trying so hard not to let it show
But you got me feeling like
I'm stepping on buildings, cars and boats
I swear I could touch the sky

Ohhh oh ohhh
I'm ten feet tall
Ohhh oh ohhhh
I'm ten feet tall

You build me up
Make me what I never was
You build me up
From nothing into something
Something from the dust

Been trying so hard not to let it show
But you got me feeling like
I'm stepping on buildings, cars and boats
I swear I could touch the sky

Ohhh oh ohhh
I'm ten feet tall
Ohhh oh ohhhh
I'm ten feet tall
