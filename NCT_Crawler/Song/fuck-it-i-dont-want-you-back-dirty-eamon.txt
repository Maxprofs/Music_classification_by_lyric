                        *** It (I Don't Want You Back) Lyrics
Artist: Eamon



Whoa oh oh 

No, no, no

See I dont know why 
I liked you soo much
I gave you all of my trust
I told you, I loved you
Now that's all down the drain
You put me through pain
I wanna let you know how I feel

*** what I said, it dont mean *** now
*** the presents, might as well throw 'em out
*** all those kisses, they didn't mean jack
*** you you ho, I dont want you back(2x)

You thought, you could keep this *** from me, yea
You burnt bitch, I heard the story
You played me, you even gave him head.
Now you're asking for me back
Your just another act
Look elsewhere, cause you're done with me

*** what I said it dont mean *** now
*** the presents, might as well throw em out
*** all those kisses, they didn't mean jack
*** you you ho, I dont want you back (2x)

Oh oh
Uh huh yeah
Oh oh
Uh huh yeah
Oh oh
Uh huh yeah

Ya questioned, did I care
You could ask anyone, I even said 
Ya were my great one
Now its over, but I do admit I'm sad.
It hurts real bad, I can't sweat that, cuz I loved a hoe

*** what I said it dont mean *** now
*** the presents might as well throw em out
*** all those kisses, they didn't mean jack
*** you you ho, I dont want you back

Oh oh
Uh huh yeah
Oh oh
Uh huh yeah
Oh oh
Uh huh yeah
Oh oh
Uh huh yeah
Oh oh
Uh huh yeah
Oh oh
Uh huh yeah
Oh oh
Uh huh yeah
Oh oh
Uh huh yeah
Oh oh
Uh huh yeah
Oh oh
Uh huh yeah
Oh oh
Uh huh yeah
