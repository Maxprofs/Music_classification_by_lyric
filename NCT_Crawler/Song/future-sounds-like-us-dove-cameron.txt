                        Bài hát : Future Sounds Like Us - Dove Cameron

5, 4, 3, 2, 1
We counting down, down...
Get ready!

From this moment on

The future is now, now...
Get ready!

Lifting off like spaceships in the night!
We're out of sight!
Brighter than the sun
We counting down

Everybody move to the beat of your heart!
Dancing through infinity, beyond the stars!
There's no looking back, 'cause here we come!
The future sounds, oh, the future sounds like us!

We're taking off at the speed of light!
Blowing through your speakers from the satellites!
What you're gonna hear is not what it was!
The future sounds, oh, the future sounds like us!

Can you hear the rush?
We taking over, o-o-over, yeah
Futuristic drums
Are blasting louder, louder, yeah

Shooting through the sky, flashes of light
We're out of sight, yeah!
Year three thousand twelve,
We coming for ya', oh yeah!

Everybody move to the beat of your heart!
Dancing through infinity, beyond the stars!
There's no looking back, 'cause here we come!
The future sounds, oh, the future sounds like us!

We're taking off at the speed of light!
Blowin' through your speakers from the satellites!
What you're gonna hear is not what it was!
The future sounds, oh, the future sounds like us!

5, 4, 3, 2, 1...
We counting down, d-down...
The future is nooooooooooooooooooow
Woo!

Everybody move to the beat of your heart! (Oh, yeah)
Dancing through infinity, beyond the stars!
There's no looking back, 'cause here we come! (Here we come!)
The future sounds, oh, the future sounds like us!

We're taking off at the speed of light!
Blowing through your speakers from the satellites! (Here we come...)
What you're gonna hear is not what it was! (Not what it was)
The future sounds, oh, the future sounds like us!

Can you hear the rush?
We taking over, over, over...
                        
                    |
