                        Bài hát: Burn The World - Seether

Walking on water, like you're the martyr
You can't deceive us all
Touch me and plead me, lance me and bleed me
You can't perceive it all

And tell me you love me
Worship and need me
Tell me you want it all
Cause we could be married
Kids in a carriage
We could've have had it all
But...

You let the world burn down
You let the world burn down
You let the world burn down
You let the world burn down

Never belong to this world that you cling to
I'll never believe at all
Your tongue says you want to, your mouth says you need to
You cannot have it all

So tell me you love me
Never would leave me
Tell me you want it all
We'll never be happy until you forgive me
I should just end it all

You let the world burn down
You let the world burn down
You let the world burn down
You let the world burn down

You let the world burn down
You let the world burn down
You let the world burn down
You let the world burn down
                        
                    |
