                        Bài hát: Revival (Interlude) - Eminem

[Verse: Skylar Grey]
I've drowned in high from the ashes, now
I can't recall your laughter
The smoke of everything, go grasp at ends
Of what's left over
And the lights in every broken
Blown out window screaming, laughing
I hope to feel it coursing out
This is our revival
                        
                    |
