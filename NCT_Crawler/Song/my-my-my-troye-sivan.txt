                        Bài hát: My My My! - Troye Sivan

[Verse 1]
Shine on, diamond
Don't make me wait another day
'Cause passion is passion
You know it just as well as me

[Pre-Chorus]
Now, let's stop running from love
Running from love
Let's stop, my baby
Let's stop running from us
Running from us
Let's stop, my baby

[Chorus]
Oh my, my, my!
I die every night with you
Oh my, my, my!
Living for your every move

[Verse 2]
Spark up, buzz cut
I got my tongue between your teeth
Go slow, no, no, go fast
You like it just as much as me

[Pre-Chorus]
Now, let's stop running from love
Running from love
Let's stop, my baby
Let's stop running from us
Running from us
Let's stop, my baby

[Chorus]
Oh my, my, my!
I die every night with you
Oh my, my, my!
Living for your every move

[Bridge]
Should be the last night ever
Should be the last night we're apart
Got my name on this treasure
On this treasure

[Chorus]
Oh my, my, my!
I die every night with you
Oh my, my, my!
Living for your every move
                        
                    |
