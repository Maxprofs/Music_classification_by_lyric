                        Feels like your life is over,
Feels like no hope is gone,
You kiss it all away,
Maybe, Maybe.

This is a second coming,
This is a call to arms,
You'll find us now and we'll be,
Wasted, Wasted.

Hey, hey, 
Hell is what you,
Make, make,
Rise against your,
Faith, faith,
Nothings gonna keep me down,
Even if it's killling you,
Cos you know it's true.

Well listen up, listen up,
There's a devil in the church,
Got a bullet in the chamber,
And this is gonna hurt,
Let it out, let it out,
You can scream, and you can shout,
Keep your secrets in the shadows,
And you'll be sorry.

Everybodys getting numb,
Everybodys on the run.

Listen up, listen up,
There's a devil in the church,
Got a bullet in the chamber,
And this is gonna hurt.

You got your hell together,
You know it could be worse,
A self inflicted murder,
Maybe, maybe.
You say it's all a crisis,
You say it's all a blur,
There comes a time you gotta,
Face it, face it.

Hey, hey, 
Hell is what you,
Make, make,
Rise against your,
Faith, faith,
Nothings gonna keep me down,
Even if it's killling you,
Cos you know it's true.

Listen up, listen up,
There's a devil in the church,
Got a bullet in the chamber,
And this is gonna hurt,
Let it out, let it out,
You can scream, and you can shout,
Keep your secrets in the shadows,
And you'll be sorry.

Everybodys getting numb,
Everybodys on the run
