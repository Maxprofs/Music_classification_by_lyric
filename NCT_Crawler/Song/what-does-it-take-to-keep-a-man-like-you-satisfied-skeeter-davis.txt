                        I guess my lovin just aint good enough for you
 'Cause every time I turn my head, you look at someone new
 Your kind dont like walking, babe, you want an easy ride
 What does it take, to keep a man like you satisfied? Youve got a plan in mind, to make things come your way
 I wonder if its worth the price, youre gonna have to pay
 'Cause life gets cold and lonely when your self respect has died
 What does it take, to keep a man like you satisfied? You think you need more love than any other man
 Someday youll taste your cup of life and find it filled with sand And then youll have to turn and face the man within
 From where I stand, I dont think youll be proud of where you've been
 And when youre running from yourself, theres just no place to hide
 What does it take, to keep a man like you satisfied?
 What does it take, to keep a man like you satisfied?
