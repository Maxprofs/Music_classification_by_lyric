                        Bài hát : Numb - August Alsina, B.o.B, Yo Gotti

[Verse 1: B.o.B]
She was already on deck 'fore I ever met her
Young Bob in the building looking like on these suckas
Man I swear somebody better tell her
I don’t care what’s on your mind I just want your cerebellum
Yea but my team stay down through the
Back when we was hustling and nobody would help us
Now we poppin bottles man, now we top shelfers
We just knew that we would make it man, nobody could tell us nothing better
Nothing a fortune teller couldn’t tell us
As a youngin I never really cared for Christmas carols
Now when you see my apparel I got several different levels
Look at my wrist, bitch, it’s levels to these bezels
This whip is mine but I drive it like I stole it
Flying down the interstate, lighting up a stougin'
Hustle Gang on that mob ***, bring me my canoles
Beating up the box, call me Oscar De La Hoya

[Verse 2: August Alsina]
I had one, two, three too many
I’m *** up, four chicks with me
I’m loud, took about five shots
Six bottles I just copped
Twisted, turnt up, 24/7
That's more bad bitches I’m getting
They know I hit 'em and quit 'em
And go past what they came here for

Baby can I see you make yo ass drop?
I’mma let the Rose bottles pop
I’mma sip this 'Roc, baby don’t stop
Cause yo body on fire, you too hot

[Bridge: August Alsina]
I can’t feel my face
I’m so numb
I’m so wasted
So dumb
I’m *** faced-ed
Just in case I don’t make it

[Hook]
Take my drink, nigga I’m buzzin'
Take my trees, nigga I’m gone
Take my keys, nigga it’s nothin'
One of these chicks is taking me home [x2]

[Verse 3: August Alsina]
That little red bone said she’s taking me home
Fine ass friend said she coming along
Love in the morning, so I’m ***in' em strong
I’mma beat em to sleep then I’m gone in the morning
Hold up! I tell a bitch roll up
Before I gotta roll out all I do is turn up
Turn down *** what, need another drink
Baby go and pour up, money hungover

So you know I gotta throw up the 'fetti
So that they know that I’m ready
To get em poppin' and droppin' the party never be stoppin'
Cause I be keepin' 'em rockin', you all these bitches be choosin'
Cause now they see that I’m winning like I’m allergic to losing and I..

[Bridge]

[Hook] [x2]

(Verse 4: Yo Gotti)
Gettin' high off the money, nigga yeah I made it
Just count a mill, nigga now I’m faded
You know I’m unstoppable, I feel like Vegas
Shout out to the hood – ‘cause that’s who raised me
Hunnid bands in my pocket boy, that’s that kush
And shawty wanna *** she gave me that look
Hustler of the year know every rule in the book
Pull up in the 'Rari, boy that's all it took
That’s a white out, it’s a night out
Putting money on the bar there just to bring the light out
I just wanna see your fire-works
Fifty bottles, that’s slight work
I’m in the club, turn up

[Hook] [x2]

[Outro]
Nu ah ah ah ah ah umb
Smoke until you go du ah ah ah ah ah umb
Let’s drink until you go nu ah ah ah ah ah umb
Smoke until you go du ah ah ah ah ah umb
Drink until you go nu ah ah ah ah ah umb
Smoke until you go du ah ah ah ah ah umb
Let’s drink until you go nu ah ah ah ah ah umb
Smoke until you go du ah ah ah ah ah umb
