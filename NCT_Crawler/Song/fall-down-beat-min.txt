                        Bài hát: Fall Down (Beat) - Min (St.319)

Wake up in the morning I
Feel misty in my mind
When everybody is sleeping
When everybody is sleeping
You came up in the night
Seduced me with your light
For the next day when I wake up
My wings are already gone
It's the pain of the youth
I'm a girl with a broken heart (oh... no)
You've stole my wings, got me down
No more light, stucked into the ground
No more flying I fall down...
You said you cared but you lied...
I've locked my heart, swallowed the key...
Please don't come back down and hurt me
I fall down...
You said you cared but you lied...
You said you cared but you... lied.
