                        You can dance
 Every dance with the guy
 Who gave you the eye
 Let him hold you tight

 You can smile
 Every smile for the man
 Who held your hand
 'Neath the pale moonlight

 But don't forget who's takin' you home
 And in whose arms you're gonna be
 Oh, darlin'
 Save the last dance for me

 Yes, I know that the music's fine
 Like sparklin' wine
 Go and have your fun

 Laugh and sing
 But while we're apart
 Don't give your heart to anyone

 And don't forget who's takin' you home
 And in whose arms you're gonna be
 Oh darlin'
 Save the last dance for me

 Baby, don't you know I love you so
 Can't you feel it when we touch
 And I'll never, never let you go
 I need you, oh so much

 You can dance
 Go on, carry on
 Till the night is gone
 And it's time to go

 And if he asks
 If you're all alone
 And can he take you home
 You must tell him no

 And don't forget who's takin' you home
 And in whose arms you're gonna be
 Darlin' save the last dance for me
 Oh, darlin' save the last dance for me
                        
                    |
