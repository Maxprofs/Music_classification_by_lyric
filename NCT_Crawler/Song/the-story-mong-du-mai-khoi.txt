                        Bài hát: The Story (Mộng Du) - Mai Khôi

Here in the crowd you say out loud
You tell anh story of the castles
Oh it is you the lonely man
Your life doesn't come in colors.

Your wife is home your child is home
Your story's out you tell it so loud
Hope you don't cry in bed tonight
Your child is prayin' for wings.

Bring it the wings your wife the ring
Don't tell the story of the castles
I hope yo' child ain't cry tonight
Its life is comin' in colors.

Your wife is home your child is home
Your story's out
You tell it so loud
Hope you don't cry in bed tonight
Your child is prayin' for wings.
