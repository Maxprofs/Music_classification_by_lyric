                        Once was a kingdom, far far away.
 Love was the rule of the day.
 Nothing more nothing less
 Than to give your friend your best.
 There's much more story that I could tell
 To make the hardest hearts swell. This is the story when love was king. When love was king, do you remember?
 When love was king, when love was king
 I remember when love was king He ruled the land, with his fist unfurled
 With open arms for the world
 Of hungry children, first he'd think
 To pull their lives from the brink
 When love was king
 He rescued souls lost in the sea
 In drifting vessel he would hear their plea
 When love was king
 He threw a line before they'd sink
 And gave the thirsty ones a drink He told the meek that they should try
 To use the sword to smite the lie
 That being king is for the weak
 When love was king
 I pray the lord these words we seek When love was king
 He showed respect for every man
 Regardless of their skin or clan
 Beside him stood his mighty queen
 and equal force wise and keen
 He lifted up the underneath
 And all his wealth he did bequeath
 To those who toiled with out a gain
 SO they would remember his reign So seek someplace to call your own
 Right next to this mighty shinning throne
 When love was king
 When love was king
