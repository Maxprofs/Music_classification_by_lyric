                        Song: Breathe On Me - Britney Spears, Ying Yang Twins

It's so hot in here

Ohh, it's so hot, and I need some air


Oh boy, don't stop 'cause I'm halfway there
It's not complicated, it's just syncopated
We can read each other's minds
One love united two bodies synchronizing
Don't even need to touch me baby, just

Breathe on me, yeah
Baby just, breathe on me
We don't need to touch, just
Breathe

Ohh, this is way beyond the physical
(It's a way beyond the physical)
Tonight, my senses don't make sense at all
Our imagination, takin' us to places
We have never been before
Take me in let it out
Don't even need to touch me baby, just

Breathe on me
Baby just, breathe on me
We don't need to touch, just
Breathe on me
(Breathe on me)
Baby just, breathe on me
(Breathe on me)
We don't need to touch, just
Breathe

Monogamy is the way to go
Just put your lips together and blow

Breathe
Breathe
Breathe

Breathe on me
Baby just, breathe on me
We don't need to touch, just
Breathe on me
(Breathe on me)
Baby just, breathe on me
(Breathe on me)
We don't need to touch just
                        
                    |
