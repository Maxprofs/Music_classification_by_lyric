                        Oh it's so hot in here Oh it's so hot and I need some air
 And boy, don't stop 'cause I'm halfway there
 It's not complicated, we're just syncopated
 We can read each others minds
 One love united, two bodies synchronizing
 Don't even need to touch me baby just Breathe on me, yeah
 Oh baby just, breathe on me
 We don't need to touch, just breathe Oh this is way beyond the physical
 And tonight my senses don't make sense at all
 Our imagination taking us to places
 We've never been before, take me in, let it out
 Don't even need to touch me baby just Breathe on me, yeah
 Oh baby just, breathe on me
 We don't need to touch, just Breathe on me
 Oh baby just, breathe on me
 We don't need to touch, just breathe Monogamy is the way to go
 Just put your lips together and blow
 Breathe, breathe, breathe Breathe on me
 Baby just, breathe on me
 We don't need to touch, just Breathe on me
 Oh baby just, breathe on me
 We don't need to touch, just
