                        Bài hát: What Do You Mean - Justin Bieber 

What do you mean? 
Ohhh-woah 
When you nod your head yes 
But you wanna say no 
What do you mean? 
Heeey-yeah 
When you don't want me to move 
But you tell me to go 

What do you mean? 
Oh 
What do you mean? 
Said we're running out of time 
What do you mean? 
Ohhh-oh-ph 
What do you mean? 
Better make up your mind 
What do you mean? 

You're so indecisive of what I'm saying 
Trying to catch the beat make up your heart 
Don't know if you're happy or complaining 
Don't want for us to end where do I start 

First you wanna go left and you want to turn right 
Wanna argue all day make love all night 
First you up and you're down and then between 
Ohh I really want to know... 

What do you mean? 
Ohhh-woah 
When you nod your head yes 
But you wanna say no 
What do you mean? 
Heeey-yeah 
When you don't want me to move 
But you tell me to go 

What do you mean? 
Oh 
What do you mean? 
Said we're running out of time 
What do you mean? 
Ohhh-oh-oh 
What do you mean? 
Better make up your mind 
What do you mean? 

You're overprotective when I'm leaving 
Trying to compromise but I can't win 
You wanna make a point but you keep preaching 
You had me from the start won't let this end 

First you wanna go to the left and you want to turn right 
Wanna argue all day, make love all night 
First you up and you're down and then between 
Ohh I really want to know... 

What do you mean? 
Ohhh-woah 
When you nod your head yes 
But you wanna say no 
What do you mean? 
Heeey-yeah 
When you don't want me to move 
But you tell me to go 
What do you mean? 

I wanna know 
What do you mean? 
Said you're running out of time 
What do you mean? 
Oh baby 
Ohhh-oh-oh 
What do you mean? 
Better make up your mind 

What do you mean? 
Ohhh-woah 
When you nod your head yes 
But you wanna say no 
What do you mean? 
Heeey-yeah 
When you don't want me to move 
But you tell me to go 

What do you mean? 
Oh 
What do you mean? 
Said we're running out of time 
What do you mean? 
Ohhh-oh-oh 
What do you mean? 
Better make up your mind 
What do you mean?
