                        Bài hát: No Broken Hearts - Bebe Rexha, Nicki Minaj

Oh baby, oh baby
(This is a star-studded collaboration)
(I know that you’ve been hurting)
I'm Nicki Minaj!
(Oh baby, oh baby)
That's Bebe, let's go!
(I know that you’ve been hurting)

No broken hearts in the club
No tears in the club
'Cause we gon' get it poppin' tonight
No broken hearts in the club
More drinks, pour it up
'Cause we gon' get it poppin' tonight

We goin' straight to Miami
Hop on a plane going no wheres
Shinin' so hard like a Grammy
Forget all the players, what they did?
We gon' be buying the drinks
We gon' be buying the drinks
Line up the bottles, line up the models
We gon' forget everything!

Oh, ain't nobody going home!
You know what you came for
To dance off the pain, don't feel a thing
You just feel the champagne
If you're feeling lonely
Baby let me hear you say

No broken hearts in the club
No tears in the club
'Cause we gon' get it poppin' tonight
No broken hearts in the club
More drinks, pour it up
'Cause we gon' get it poppin' tonight

We only got one life
So let's go hard 'til the day we die
No broken hearts in the club
More drinks, pour it up
'Cause we gon' get it poppin' tonight

We gon' do it like Biggie
Sky is the limit in this town
We taking over the city
We so high, can't bring us down
We gon' do what we do
We gon' do what we do
Three in the morning, 4 in the morning
Meet you for eggs in the morning

Oh, ain't nobody going home!
You know what you came for
To dance off the pain, don't feel no shame
You just feel the champagne
If you're feeling lonely
Baby let me hear you say

No broken hearts in the club
No tears in the club
'Cause we gon' get it poppin' tonight
No broken hearts in the club
More drinks, pour it up
'Cause we gon' get it poppin' tonight

We only got one life
So let's go hard 'til the day we die
No broken hearts in the club
More drinks, pour it up
'Cause we gon' get it poppin' tonight

Ay yo Bebe, anyone hatin' need a pee pee
Sip a little mix, pop pills till I’m sleepy
I’m the one that bust it open out in Waikiki
Pull up in the Ghost I’m creepy
They don’t want beef we proved it
Niggas better keep it on wax like a Q-tip
Keep his dick wetter than the cruise ship
Flower than a tulip, flyer than your new bitch
I do’s it, yup I’m up two zip

Girls is my sons I'm giving them mild tease
They be sweating me headbands and gym tees
Like bad knees on Dirk Nowitzki’s
It is going down like M. Lewinsky’s
Wrist freeze yep my wrist on pink skis
Ring finger be shitting on my pinky’s
Make em mad aw man I got them hating bad
Blood clot money green like Jamaican flags

No broken hearts in the club
No tears in the club
'Cause we gon' get it poppin' tonight
No broken hearts in the club
More drinks, pour it up
'Cause we gon' get it poppin' tonight

We only got one life
So let's go hard 'til the day we die
No broken hearts in the club
More drinks, pour it up
'Cause we gon' get it poppin' tonight
