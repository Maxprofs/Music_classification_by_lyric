                        Bài hát: Breathe - Backstreet Boys

[Brian Electronically:]
We're not over

[Kevin:]
The roses you left me slowly fading to grey
Your coat on the chair and the scent of your hair I miss
The clock on the wall it reminds me of all the better times
When we walked in the park and we whispered in the dark
Yeah we laughed and cried

[Bridge:]
And I never knew alone wherever you are is home

[Chorus:]
Without your lips on mine no the sun doesn't shine and no I can't breathe
I can't breathe
Your words are a symphony music that sings to me no I can't breathe
I can't Breathe
I can't Breathe

[AJ:]
Ooh I walked by the store where we sat on the floor and we ate like kings
And someone said hey we're locking the door no time to play

[Bridge]

[Chorus]

[Brian Electronically:]
We're not over
We're not over

[Brian:]
Without your lips on mine no the sun doesn't shine
and no I can't...
You know I can't Breathe

[Chorus:]
(Yeah No No I can't breathe)
Without your lips on mine no the sun doesn't shine and no I can't breathe
I can't breathe
Your words are a symphony music that sings to me no I can't breathe
I can't Breathe
I can't Breathe
(We're not We're not over)
I can't Breathe
I can't Breathe
(don't say it's over don't say it's over)
Noooooooooooooo
                        
                    |
