Title:Enjoy The Silence
Artist:Susan boyle
Words by 【__MySoul__】

Words like violence
Break the silence
Come crashing in
Into my little world
Painful to me
Pierce right through me
Can't you understand
Oh my little boy
All I ever wanted
All I ever needed
Is here in my arms
Words are very unnecessary
They can only do harm
Music...

Vows are spoken
To be broken
Feelings are intense
Words are trivial
Pleasure remain
So does the pain
Words are meaningless
And forgettable
All I ever wanted
All I ever needed
Is here in my arms
Words are very unnecessary
They can only do harm
Music...

All I ever wanted
All I ever needed
Is here in my arms
Words are very unnecessary
They can only do harm
Music...
