                        Bài hát: Go (English Version) (Cheese In The Trap OST) - Saltnpaper

Hey would you believe me
If I said I miss you
In love
You’re in love

We were in love
Oh my love

Go..

Love is really loving
If I said I miss you
I will try to be where I belong

Because there’s nothing in the world
That could take this away

So I will go into
The dark of your night

I will follow you there
And wait for your light
For you I’m alive
                        
                    |
