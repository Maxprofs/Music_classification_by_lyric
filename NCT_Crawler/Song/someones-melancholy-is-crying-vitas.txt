                        Bài hát: Someone's Melancholy Is Crying - Vitas

Someone's melancholy is crying in the autumn wind
Only I don't know how we should ask the Fate
To bring a piece of happiness instead of separation
Someone's melancholy is crying in the autumn wind
Only I don't know how we should ask the Fate
To bring a piece of happiness instead of separation
And not to wail painfully for us by night

You sway as if you were tipsy at night
It looks like we lack something
The sun got cold and the morning
Brings together hands and heads over the tables

I often feel like pang grips my heart
Someone's joy fills me again
Everyone gets together behind my back 
Like moths on a forest's glade
                        
                    |
