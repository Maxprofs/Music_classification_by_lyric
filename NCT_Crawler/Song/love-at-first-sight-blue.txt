Blue - Love At First Sight

Yeah
See if you can relate to this one

Hope I’m not disturbing you
Because you look in thought right now
I don’t mean to be rude
Cause this is normally not my style
Can I take you out
I feel if I don’t ask chance will pass
And I'll never see your face again
I’ll never see your face again

You may be thinking I am strange
Not every single day
Beauty comes my way,
so
Do you believe in love at first sight,
Tell me does that book that you are reading
Tell the story of your life
Do you believe in love at first sight
Should I walk on by,
Turn a blind eye, to love
Love at first sight

I could be the man for you
I can make all your dreams come true
Maybe I’m a fool
For saying I’m in love with you
You may be thinking I am strange
Not every single day
Beauty comes my way

Do you believe in love at first sight,
Tell me does that book that you are reading
Tell the story of your life
Do you believe in love at first sight
Should I walk on by,
Turn a blind eye, to love
Love at first sight

You say fare well
I say so long
You say goodbye
I’ll say you’re wrong
Cause here in my arms you belong

Do you believe in love at first sight,
Tell me does that book that you are reading
Tell the story of your life
Do you believe in love at first sight
Should I walk on by,
Turn a blind eye, to love
Love at first sight
Do you believe in love at first sight,
Tell me does that book that you are reading
Tell the story of your life
Do you believe in love at first sight
Should I walk on by,
Turn a blind eye, to love
Love at first sight
To love, love at first sight....
