                        I can see it in your eyes,
No more tears, no alibis,
I'm still in love with you,
There's so much I gotta show,
I will never let you go,
But still I know for sure,
Come take me by the hand,
This summer never ends,

And I want to know that you believe in love again,
Please tell me now it's not the end,
'Cause this I promise you so true, 
The summer belongs to you,
Could you believe in love again?
How can I make you understand?
But this I promise you so true, 
The summer belongs to you.

The summer belongs to you.

Would you catch me if I fall?
Crash and burn and lose it all,
Tell me what to do,
'Cause I need you night and day,
Will you ever run away?
Just one more thing to say

Come take me by the hand,
This summer never ends,

And I want to know that you believe in love again,
Please tell me now it's not the end,
'Cause this I promise you so true, 
The summer belongs to you,
Could you believe in love again?
How can I make you understand?
But this I promise you so true, 
The summer belongs to you.

The summer belongs to you
