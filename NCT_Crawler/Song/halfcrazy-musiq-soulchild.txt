Never thought that we would ever be more than friends
Now I'm all confused cause for you I have deeper feelings
We both thought it was cool to cross the line
And I was convinced it would be alright
Now things are strange, nothings the same
And really I just want my friend back

And my mind's gone half crazy cause I can't leave you alone (oh can't get you out of my system)
And I'm wondering if it's worth me holding on (holding on)
Said my mind's gone half crazy cause I can't leave you alone (can't get you out of my system)
And I'm wondering if it's worth me holding on (yeah)

I'd hate walk away from you as if this never existed
Cause when we kissed the moment after I looked at you different
Lately I gotta watch what I say
Cause you take things personally nowadays
You used to laugh now you get mad
Damn I just want my friend back (yeah yeah)

And my mind's gone half crazy cause I can't leave you alone (oh can't get you out of my system)
And I'm wondering if it's worth me holding on (holding on yeah oh )
Said my mind's gone half crazy cause I can't leave you alone (can't get you out of my system yeah yeah)
And I'm wondering if it's worth me holding on

oh oh oh oh oh yeah
What happened to the one I used to know oh yeah yeah
The one I used to laugh and joke with
The one I used to tell all my secrets
We used to chill and be down for whatever whenever together yeah

And my mind's gone half crazy (oh) cause I can't leave you alone (I'm going half crazy baby)
And I'm wondering if it's worth me holding on (over you yeah over you)
Said my mind's gone half crazy (yeah oh) cause I can't leave you alone (and I just don't know)
And I'm wondering if it's worth me holding on (said I just don't know what to do now)
listen
we used to chill yeah we used to hang yeah
we used to we used to do some many things together yeah
yeah yeah oh
yeah yeah oh
oh oh oh
yeah yeah
oh oh oh
