                        Bài hát: Say It With Your Body - INNA

You you don`t have to move your lips
You say it with your body
We we don`t have to talk all that
And I knew the second that I saw you
Never felt like this before
They don`t make like you no more
Come alive like an animal...!

Do do do do don`t talk
Say it with your body
Do do do do don`t talk
Say it with your body
Say it with your body
You tell me that Im all you want
That you knew the second when you saw me
You you make me move my hips like you do
I want you to control me
Never felt like this before
They don`t make it like you no more
Come alive like an animal

Do do do do don`t talk
Say it with your body
Do do do do don`t talk
Say it with your body
Say it with your body
Say it with your body

(Say it with your body)
