                        Bài hát: Don't Make Me Wait For Love - Kenny G, Lenny Williams 

Sitting here just staring at your picture
Waiting for your call
So unclear, I’m hanging on a notion
We could have it all

Time and time again you tell me to be patient
But we can’t let love slip away

Baby, don’t make me wait for love this time
Darlin’, a love like this is hard to find
Don’t make me wait for love

I close the blinds and try to hide the darkness
Fall asleep alone
Give me your sign, a man ain’t supposed to face life
Standing on his own

When you’re near me I can’t help but see forever
Come and rescue me tonight

Don’t make me wait for love this time
A love like this is hard to find
Don’t make me wait for love

Don’t make me wait for love this time
A love like this is hard to find

Baby
Darlin'
Baby
Darlin'
