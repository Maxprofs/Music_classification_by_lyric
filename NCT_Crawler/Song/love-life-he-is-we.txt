Lalalalalalala love Life
What’s that?
Lalalalalalala love Life
What’s that?

Hush now.
Quiet down.
Can you hear my heart racing?
Falling to my knees cause I’ve been a chasing a lie. (a lie)
Love life
I don’t know what I was thinking, dipped my toes in, now I’m sinking
I guess it hurts a bit but I’m over it now.

Heartaches and mistakes,
How many hits can a good girl take.
I’m tired of hurting, slowly learning
I rate you’re too late.
Look at the mess that you’ve created
First date to slight hate
Love life
What’s that?

Lalalalalalalalala love life
What’s that?
Lalalalalalalalala love life
What’s that?

I tried, yes I tried.
But it takes two to make it
I’m obsessed and you can’t fake it
Denied
Deep inside
I wanna break your heart too
Lead you on and up to drop you.
I guess it hurts a bit but I’m over it now.

Heartaches and mistakes
How many hits can a good girl take.
I’m tired of hurting, slowly learning
I rate you’re too late,
Look at the mess that you’ve created
First date to slight hate
Love life
What’s that?

Lalalalalalalalala Love Life
What’s that?
Lalalalalalalalala Love Life
What’s that?

Grey clouds above me
Like when you said you love me
Winds blowing me away
But part of me will always stay
Eyes closed, arms wide
Embrace the storm that I feel inside
No more crying, no more crying
I don’t mind a chop or two
But god I love that sound, sound
Thunder of my inner chaos slowly calming
Down, down
I look up in the sky
No longer seeing you
Look up in the sky
See the sun coming through

Lalalalalalalalala Love Life
What’s that?
Lalalalalalalalala Love Life

Heartaches and mistakes
How many hits can a good girl take.
I’m tired of hurting, slowly learning
I rate, you’re too late,
Look at the mess that you’ve created
First date you slide hate
Love life
What’s that?
Lalalalalalalalala Love Life (What’s that?)
Lalalalalalalalala Love Life (What’s that?)
