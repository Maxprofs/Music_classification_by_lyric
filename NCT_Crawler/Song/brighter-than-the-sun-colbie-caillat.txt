Colbie Caillat - Brighter Than the Sun

Stop me on the corner
I swear you hit me like a vision
I, I, I wasn’t expecting
But who am I to tell fate
where it’s supposed to go with it
Don’t you blink you might miss it
See we got a right to just love it or leave it
You find it and keep it
Cause it ain’t every day
you get the chance to say
Oh this is how it starts
lighting strikes the heart
It goes off like a gun
 brighter than the sun
Oh it could be the stars
falling from the sky
Shining how we want
brighter than the sun

I never seen it
but I found this love I won’t defeat it
You better leave I’m gonna treat it
better than anything I’ve ever had
Cause you’re so damn beautiful read it
It’s time and deliver it let’s seal it
Boy we go together like peanuts
and paydays and molly and reggae
And it ain’t every day
you get the chance to say
Oh, this is how it starts
 lighting strikes the heart
It goes off like a gun
brighter than the sun
Oh, it could be the stars
falling from the sky

Shining how we want
brighter than the sun

Everything is like a white out
cause we shook-shook- shine down
Even when the light’s out
but I can see you glow
Got my head up in the rafters
got me happy ever after
Never felt this way before
ain’t felt this way before

I swear you hit me like a vision
I, I, I wasn’t expecting
But who am I to tell fate
where it’s supposed to go with it
Oh, this is how it starts
lighting strikes the heart
It goes off like a gun
brighter than the sun
Oh, it could be the stars
falling from the sky
Shining how we want
brighter than the sun
Oh, this is how it starts
lighting strikes the heart
It goes off like a gun
brighter than the sun
brighter than the sun
Brighter than the sun
Brighter than the sun

Oh this is how it starts
 lighting strikes the heart
It goes off like a gun
 brighter than the sun
Oh, this is how it starts
lighting strikes the heart
It goes off like a gun
brighter than the sun
Oh, this is how it starts
lighting strikes the heart
It goes off like a gun
brighter than the sun
Oh, this is how it starts
lighting strikes the heart
It goes off like a gun
brighter than the sun
