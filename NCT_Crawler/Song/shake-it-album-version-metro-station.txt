                        I'll take you home if you don't leave me at the front door (leave me at the front door)
 Your body's cold, but girl we're getting so warm
 And I was thinking of ways that I could get inside (get inside)
 Tonight you're falling in love (let me go now)
 This feeling's tearing me up (here we go now)

 Now if she does it like this, will you do it like that?
 Now if she touches like this, will you touch her right back?
 Now if she moves like this, will you move her like that? (Come on)

 Shake, Shake, Shake, Shake, uh shake it
 Shake, Shake, Shake, Shake, uh shake it
 Shake, Shake, Shake, Shake, uh shake it
 Shake, Shake, Shake, Shake, uh shake it
 Shake, Shake, Shake, Shake, uh shake it

 Your lips tremble but your eyes are in a straight stare (straight stare)
 We're on the bed but your clothes are laying right there
 And I was thinking of places that I could hide (I could hide)
 Tonight you're falling in love (let me go now)
 This feelings tearing me up (here we go now)

 Now if she does it like this, will you do it like that?
 Now if she touches like this, will you touch her right back?
 Now if she moves like this, will you move her like that? (Come on)

 Shake, Shake, Shake, Shake, uh shake it
 Shake, Shake, Shake, Shake, uh shake it
 Shake, Shake, Shake, Shake, uh shake it
 Shake, Shake, Shake, Shake, uh shake it
 Shake, Shake, Shake, Shake, uh shake it

 I saw you dancing and I couldn't get you off my mind
 (I could tell that you could tell that I was takin' my time)
 I was thinking of ways that you would stay and be mine
 (Your body's shaking, turn me on, so I can turn off the lights)

 Now if she does it like this, will you do it like that?
 Now if she touches like this, will you touch her right back?
 Now if she moves like this, will you move her like that? (Come on)
