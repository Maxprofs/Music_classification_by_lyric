                        Let's take it nice and easy
 It's gonna be so easy
 For us to fall in love Hey baby what's your hurry
 Relax, don't you worry
 We're gonna fall in love We're on the road to romance
 That's safe to say
 But let's make all the stops along the way The problem now of course is
 To simply hold your horses, to rush would be a crime
 'Cause nice and easy does it every time We're on the road to romance
 That's safe to say
 But let's make all the stops along the way The problem now of course is
 To simply hold your horses, to rush would be a crime
 'Cause nice and easy does it, nice and easy does it
 Nice and easy does it every time Like the man says one more time
 Nice and easy does it, nice and easy does it
 Nice and easy does it every time
