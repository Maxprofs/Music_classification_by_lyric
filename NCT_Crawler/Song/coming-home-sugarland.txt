                        Well hello, it's been a long time
 And I wanna know
 What's been going down
 Since I been gone And are you alright?
 Are you okay?
 Me, I'm alright But is there anyway that you could
 Make space, say grace
 Set my place at the table?
 And tell 'em I'm coming home
 Tell 'em I'm coming home Yes, I know, I know she loves me
 And she wore it so
 And I know just what she'll say
 Each time I call She'll say, "Are you alright?
 How's your work?
 Are you alright?
 How's my baby girl?" And I'll say, "I'm feeling strong
 But it's been too long"
 So I wrote this song to say I miss you
 And tell you I'm coming home
 Momma, I'm coming home Angels on high at the top of a tree
 Stars in the sky shine away, I can see
 Oh Momma, please leave a light on for me I'm coming home
 (I'm coming home)
 Tell 'em I'm coming home
 (I'm coming home)
 Tell 'em I'm coming home
 (I'm coming home, I'm coming home) I'm going home, I'm going home, I'm going home
 (I'm going home)
 Momma, won't you leave a light on for me? I'm coming home, leave a light on for me
 (I'm coming home)
 And I'm coming home
 (I'm coming home, I'm coming home)
 Tell 'em I'm coming home
                        
                    |
