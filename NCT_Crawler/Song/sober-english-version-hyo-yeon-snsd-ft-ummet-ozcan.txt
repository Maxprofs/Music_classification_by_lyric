                        Bài hát: Sober (English Version) - Hyo Yeon (SNSD), Ummet Ozcan

I know that I’m a mess
Do things that I regret
Can’t help that I can’t help myself
You’ll never understand
It’s hard to have one man
So just for now I’ll wish you well

Cause I ain’t looking
Right now ain’t looking for love
But I might be feeling
Some kinda way tomorrow
Tonight I’m doing
All of the things that I want
I better be going
But if you want tomorrow

You can take me out
Pour some wine and rub my shoulders
But I don’t want you now
I’ll come back when I’m hungover
So I’ll, be yours when the night is over
I, only love you when I’m sober

Can tell you’re into this
And that sometimes you wish
That you could have me all to yourself
You don’t know where I’ve been
Cause I just came and went
I’m not the type to kiss and tell

Cause I ain’t looking
Right now ain’t looking for love
But I might be feeling
Some kinda way tomorrow
Tonight I’m doing
All of the things that I want
I better be going
But if you want tomorrow

You can take me out
Pour some wine and rub my shoulders
But I don’t want you now
I’ll come back when I’m hungover
So I’ll, be yours when the night is over
I, only love you when I’m sober

You can take me out
Pour some wine and rub my shoulders
But I don’t want you now
I’ll come back when I’m hungover
So I’ll, be yours when the night is over
I, only love you when I’m sober

Only love you when I’m sober
                        
                    |
