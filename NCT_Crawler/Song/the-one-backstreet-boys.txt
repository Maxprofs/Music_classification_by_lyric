I' be the one

I guess you were lost when I met you
Still there were tears in your eyes
So out of trust and I knew
No more than mysteries and lies
There you were,wild and free
Reachin' out like you needed me
A helping hand to make it right
I am hoding you all through the night
I'll be the one
Who will make all your sorrows undone
I'll be the light
When you feel like there's nowhere to run
I'll be the one
To hold you and make sure that you'll be all right
'Cause my faith is gone
And I want to take you from darkness to light
There you were,wild and free
Reachin' out like you needed me
A helping hand to make it right
I am hoding you all through the night
I'll be the one
Who will make all your sorrows undone
I'll be the light
When you feel like there's nowhere to run
I'll be the one
To hold you and make sure that you'll be all right
You need me like I need you
We can share our dreams comin' true
I can show you what true love means
Just take my hand baby please
I'll be the one
I'll be the night
Where you can run
To make it all right
I'll be the one
I'll be the night
Where you can run
I'll be the one
Who will make all your sorrows undone
I'll be the light
When you feel like there's nowhere to run
I'll be the one
I'll be the one
I'll be the night
Where you can run
To make it all right
I'll be the one
I'll be the night
Where you can run
To make it all right
I'll be the one
To hold you and make sure that you'll be all right
I'll be the one
