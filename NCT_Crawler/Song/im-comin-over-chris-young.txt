                        Bài hát: I'm Comin' Over - Chris Young 

We say goodbye, see you around
We turn our backs then turn back around
We break up, we make up and we make love
We can’t seem to let go girl so

I’m comin’ over, running every red light
To hell with the closure, save it for another time
Try not to think about you but it ain’t working
Why put out a fire when it’s still burning
Just when I think moving On’s getting closer
I’m comin’ over

I’m all alone but you’re on my phone
Telling me you miss me, heh, that you’re at home
Who knows what we are in the morning
All I know is I want you so

I’m comin’ over, running every red light
To hell with the closure, save it for another time
Try not to think about you but it ain’t working
Why put out a fire when it’s still burning
Just when I think moving on’s getting closer
I’m comin’ over

Instrumental break

Oh, I’m comin’ over

Yet we say that we’re done and I know that it’s late
But you already know I’m on my way

I’m comin’ over, running every red light
To hell with the closure, save it for another time
Try not to think about you but it ain’t working
Why put out a fire that’s burning

I’m comin’ over, running every red light
To hell with the closure, save it for another time
Try not to think about you but it ain’t working
Why put out a fire when it’s still burning
Just when I think moving on’s getting closer
I’m comin’ over

Oh, I’m coming over
                        
                    |
