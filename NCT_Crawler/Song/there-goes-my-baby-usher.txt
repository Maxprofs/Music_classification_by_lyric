Usher - There Goes my Baby

On the road to the riches try n stop n take pictures
Pay attention to each detour and u-turn along the way
Be aware of the winding roads,
Know that as long as u take it slow
U'll be fine, plus u'll find, u're already there
On the road to the riches don't forget to stop n take pictures
Coz life ain't 'bout where you finish,
But what u've learned along the way
So as u chase success remember that i told u best
U look fine, then u'll find, u're already there

And that's the truth(go ahead be you- yeah)
Go ahead be you(if u wanna be free)
Want to be free(first u must be)
Be(just be)
Be(just be)

With the glass half empty 'least u know u're not thirsty
Try to see it for what it is, really half full now take a sip
And as it trinkles down, let it wash away any doubt
In your mind, you're fine
Don't think real joy is in position of mo-ney noo!
Don't compare your life to somebody else coz u don't know
Just what they're going through, less u walk a mile in their shoes
Don't be blind, the sun shines, on everybody here

And that's the truth(go ahead be you)
Go ahead be you(if u wanna be free)
Want to be free(then u have to first be)
Be(just be)
Be

I know that sometimes life can throw a curve
But u gotta keep on swingin hard,
It's the only way to knock one out the park
And if it doesn't make it over the wall
The only way to strike out is if you don't swing at aaaallll

And that's the truth(yeah, wanna be u)
Go ahead be you(oh, then u're gonna be free)
Want to be free(please be)
Be(just be)
Be(and i'm speakin the truth)
And that's the truth(just be you)
Go ahead be you(yea! ooh ooh u wanna beee!)
Want to be free(oh but First u must be)
Be, Be(beee)

Yea yea, yeaah ooh yeaa yea,
Beee oooh yea!
