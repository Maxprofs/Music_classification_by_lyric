Han yeojaga geudaereul saranghamnida
One woman loves you
Geu yeojaneun yeolshimhi saranghamnida
That woman loves you wholeheartedly
Maeil geurimjacheoreom geudaereul ttaradanimyeo
She follows you around like a shadow everyday
Geu yeojaneun useumyeo ulgoisseoyo
That woman is laughing and crying

Eolmana eolmana deo? neoreul
How much... just how much more?
Ireohke baraman bomyeo? honja
Do I have to gaze at you like this? alone...
I baramgateun sarang
This love that came like the wind
I geojigateun sarang
This love that is like a beggar
Gyesokhaeya niga nareul sarang hagenni OH~
If I continue this way will you love me? OH~

Jogeumman gakkai wa~ jogeumman~
Just a little nearer, come~ a little more~
Hanbal dagagamyeon
If I take one step closer to you
Du bal domangganeun
You take two steps away
Neol saranghaneun nal jigeumdo yeope isseo
I who love you am still now next to you
Geu yeojan umnida
That woman is crying

Geu yeojaneun seonggyeogi soshimhamnida
That woman’s personality is very timid
Geuraeseo unneun beobeul baeweotdamnida
Therefore she learned how to smile
Chinhan chinguegedo mothaneun yaegiga manheun
What she cannot say so much even to her best friend...
Geu yeojaeui maeumeun nunmultuseongi
That woman’s heart which is full of tears

Geuraeseo geu yeojaneun geudael
So that woman...
Neol sarang haetdeyo ttokgataseo
When she is loving you the same way
Tto hanagateun babo tto hanagateun babo
Yet another fool.. yet another fool
Hanbeon nareul anajugo gamyeon andweyo OH~
Can’t you just hug me before you go? OH~

Nan sarangbadgo shipeo geudaeyeo
I want to receive love
Maeil sogeuroman gaseum sogeuroman
Day by day in my heart, only in my heart...
Sorireul jireumyeo.. geu yeojaneun oneuldo
Just like this calling to you.. that woman today also
Geu yeope itdeyo OH~~

Geudaen babonikka~
Because you ́re a big fool~
