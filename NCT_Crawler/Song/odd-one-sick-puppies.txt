                        Odd one you're never alone,
I'm here and I will reflect you,
Both of us basically unattached to anything or anyone unless we're pretending,
You live your life in your head,
Some call it imagination,
I'd rather focus instead on anything except,
What I'm feelin,
What I'm feelin,
Odd one...

Hey,
It's gonna be OK,
Hey,
We're gonna laugh at this one day,

Odd one I wish I was you,
You're never concerned with acceptance,
We are all desperately seeking out and fitting in with any one who will accept us,
But not you,
Odd one...

Hey,
It's gonna be OK,
Hey,
We're gonna laugh at this one day,

Hey,
It's gonna be OK,
Hey,
Gonna laugh at this one day,

Hey,
It's gonna be OK,
Hey,
We're gonna laugh at this one day,

Don't let someone tell you you're no-one,
Don't let someone tell you you're no-one,
Odd one...
