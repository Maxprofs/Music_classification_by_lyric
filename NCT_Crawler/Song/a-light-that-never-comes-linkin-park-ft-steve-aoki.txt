                        Bài hát: A Light That Never Comes - Linkin Park, Steve Aoki

Nah, you don’t know me 
I break through the clouds and the fire below me 
You cannot catch me, cannot hold me 
You cannot stop much less control me 

When it rains it pours 
When the flood gates open, erase the shores 
At best you don’t care when it breaks your door 
It takes all you can take, better take some more 

Cause I know what it’s like to test fate 
Have my shoulders pressed with that weight 
Still I stood strong in spite of that hate 

The night gets darkest right before dawn 
What don’t kill you makes you more strong 
What I’ve been waiting for so long 

The nights go on 
Waiting for a light that never comes 
I chase the sun 
Waiting for a light that never comes 
Ohhhh ohhh ohhhh 
Ohhhh ohhh ohhhh 
Ohhhh ohhh ohhhh 
Waiting for a light that never comes 

When I was young, they told me, they said 
We’ll make your day, you’ll lie in our bed 
Take care, hold these reins but instead 
Then comes that day it’s off with his head 

The night gets darkest right before dawn 
What don’t kill you makes you more strong 
You’ll have my mercy, then when you’re gone 

The nights go on 
Waiting for a light that never comes 
I chase the sun 
Waiting for a light that never comes 
Ohhhh ohhh ohhhh 
Ohhhh ohhh ohhhh 
Ohhhh ohhh ohhhh 
Waiting a the light that never comes 

I told them that you don’t know me 
I break through the clouds and the fire below me 
You cannot catch me, cannot hold me 
You cannot stop much less control me 

When it rains it pours 
When the flood gates open, erase the shores 
At best you don’t care that it breaks some doors 
Say it’s all you can take, better take some more 

Ohhhh ohhh ohhhh 
Ohhhh ohhh ohhhh 
Ohhhh ohhh ohhhh 
Waiting for a light that never comes 

The nights go on 
Waiting for a light that never comes 
I chase the sun 
Waiting for a light that never comes 
Ohhhh ohhh ohhhh 
Ohhhh ohhh ohhhh 
Ohhhh ohhh ohhhh 
Waiting for a light that never comes
