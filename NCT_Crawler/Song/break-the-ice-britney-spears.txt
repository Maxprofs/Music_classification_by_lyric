                        It's been a while

I know I shouldn't have kept you waiting

But I'm here now



I know it's been a while but I'm glad you came

And I've been thinking 'bout how you say my name

You got my body spinning like a hurricane

And it feels like you got me going insane

And I can't get enough, so let me get it up



Ooh looks like we're alone now (Ahh)

You ain't gotta be scared we're grown now (Ahhh)

I'm a hit defrost on ya, let's get it blazin' (Uh-huh)

We can turn the heat up, if you wanna (Ahh)

Turn the lights down low, if you wanna (Ahhh)

Just wanna move ya but you're froze up

That's what I'm saying



Let me break the ice

Allow me to get you right

Once you warm up to me

Baby I can make you feel (hot, hot, hot, hot)

Let me break the ice

Allow me to get you right

Once you warm up to me

Baby I can make you feel (hot, hot, hot, hot)



So you warming up yet?



You got me hypnotized

I've never felt this way

You got my heart beating like an 808

Can you rise to the occasion (Ahh)

I'm patiently waiting (Ahh)

'Cause it's getting late and I can't get enough

So let me get it up



Ooh looks like we're alone now (Ahh)

You ain't gotta be scared we're grown now (Ahhh)

I'm a hit defrost on ya, let's get it blazin' (Uh-huh)

We can turn the heat up, if you wanna (Ahh)

Turn the lights down low, if you wanna (Ahhh)

Just wanna move ya but you're froze up

That's what I'm saying



Let me break the ice

Allow me to get you right

Once you warm up to me

Baby I can make you feel (hot, hot, hot, hot)

Let me break the ice

Allow me to get you right

Once you warm up to me

Baby I can make you feel (hot, hot, hot, hot)



I like this part

Ho



It feels kinda good

Yeah

Woo!



Let me break the ice

Allow me to get you right

Once you warm up to me

Baby I can make you feel (hot, hot, hot, hot)

Let me break the ice (Oh)

Allow me to get you right

Once you warm up to me, yeah

Baby I can make you feel (hot, hot, hot, hot)

Hot



Let me break the ice

Allow me to get you right

Once you warm up to me

Baby I can make you feel (hot, hot, hot, hot)

Let me break the ice

Allow me to get you right

Once you warm up to me, yeah

Baby I can make you feel (hot, hot, hot, hot)
