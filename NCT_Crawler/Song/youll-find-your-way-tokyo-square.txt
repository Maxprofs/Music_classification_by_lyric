                        Don't you cry now... it's alright
We will be just fine
Wipe your tears away tonight
Leave your worries all behind

Don't you worry, don't you cry
You will be alright
It don't matter where you are
I will be right there by your side

Don't you give up on your dream
Don't give up on your life
There'll always be brighter days
I know you will find your way

Give up your faith... work it out
You will find love somehow
If you fail, you try again
You will win the game someday

I knew your dream would come true
Things you said you would do
I knew you won't let me down
You will work it out somehow

No one knows how hard you've tried
You always been kind
Now you say you don't have to cry
Someone will love you tonight
Someone will love you tonight
Someone will love you tonight
