                        Song: That'S What I Love About Sunday - Craig Morgan

Raymond's in his Sunday best
 He's usually up to his chest in oil and grease
 There's the Martin's walkin' in
 With that mean little freckle-faced kid
 Who broke a window last week Sweet Miss Betty likes to sing off key
 In the pew behind me That's what I love about Sunday
 Sing along as the choir sways
 Every verse of Amazin' Grace
 And then we shake the Preacher's hand Go home, into your blue jeans
 Have some chicken and some baked beans
 Pick a back yard football team
 Nothin' much of anything
 That's what I love about Sunday I stroll to the end of the drive
 Pick up the Sunday Times
 Grab a coffee cup
 It looks like Sally and Ron
 Finally tied the knot
 Well, it's about time It's 35 cents off a ground round
 Baby, cut that coupon out That's what I love about Sunday
 Cat-napping on the porch swing
 You curled up next to me
 The smell of jasmine wakes us up Take a walk down a back road
 Tackle box and a cane pole
 Carve our names in that white oak
 And steal a kiss as the sun fades
 That's what I love about Sunday, oh yeah Oh, new believers gettin' baptized
 Mommas hands raised up high
 Havin' a Hallelujah good time
 A smile on everybody's face
 That's what I love about Sunday, oh yeah That's what I love about Sunday, oh yeah
