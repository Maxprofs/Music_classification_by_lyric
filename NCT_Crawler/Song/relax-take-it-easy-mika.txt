                        Bài hát: Relax, Take It Easy - Mika

Took a ride to the end of the line
Where no one ever goes
Ended up on a broken train with nobody I know

But the pain and the longing's the same
Where the dying
Now I'm lost and I'm screaming for help alone

Relax, take it easy
For there is nothing that we can do
Relax, take it easy
Blame it on me or blame it on you

Its as if I'm scared
Its as if I'm terrified
Its as if I scared
Its as if I'm playing with fire

Scared
Its as if I'm terrified
Are you scared?
Are we playing with fire?
Relax

There is an answer to the darkest times
Its clear we don't understand but the last thing on my mind
Is to leave you
I believe that were in this together
Don't scream, there are so many roads left

Relax, take it easy
For there is nothing that we can do
Relax, take it easy
Blame it on me or blame it on you

Relax, take it easy
For there is nothing that we can do
Relax, take it easy
Blame it on me or blame it on you

Relax, take it easy
For there is nothing that we can do
Relax, take it easy
Blame it on me or blame it on you

Relax, take it easy
For there is nothing that we can do
Relax, take it easy
Blame it on me or blame it on you

Its as if I'm scared
Its as if I'm terrified
Its as if I scared
Its as if I'm playing with fire

Scared
(Relax)
Its as if I'm terrified
Are you scared?
Are we playing with fire?

Relax
Relax
