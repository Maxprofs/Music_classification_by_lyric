                        Cultivate your hunger before you idealize
Motivate your anger to make them realize
Climbing the mountain, never coming down?
Break in to the contents, never falling down

My knee is still shaking like I was 12
Sneaking out the classroom by the back door
A man railed at me twice but I didn't care
Waiting is wasting for people like me

(*)Don't try to live so wise
Don't cry coz you're so right
Don't dry with fakes or fears
Coz you will hate yourself in the end

(*)

You say: "dreams are dreams
I ain't gonna play the fool anymore"
You say: "coz I still got my soul"

Take your time baby your blood needs to slow down
"Breach your soul" "reach yourself before you gloom"
Reflection of fear makes shadows of nothing
Shadows of nothing...

You still are blind, if you see the winding road
Coz there is always a straight way to the point you see

Repeat (*)
