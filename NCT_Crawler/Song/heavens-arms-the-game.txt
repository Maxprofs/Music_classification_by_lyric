                        Part the red sea and red Louis Vuittons
 Who the don? Walk inside the club with all his Gucci on
 You’ve been warned
 Packing Heat like two Lebrons
 And my crew is strong as Cali kush
 It keep you higher than Heaven’s Arms

 Gucci in my closet, pardon my head
 Pardon my French, but I’m on my Nas ***
 Off with your head, off with your bitch
 She offered me head, I offered her dick
 ? Black caught a reception, Now we off in the Ritz
 I’m rolling this kush, she coughing and ***
 Freak bitch named Jada love them lox, I got her talkin’ to Kiss
 Got my hands behind my head, Now she all in the splits
 Dick must be good, ‘cus now she in Boston with bricks
 Got a text on my iPhone, she caught with my ***
 Off with a ten, she took it ‘cus she’s far from a snitch
 Hold her mama and daddy down, got a sister in Georgetown
 Paying her tuition so she ain’t gotta be strippin’
 It’s money so I ain’t trippin’, this bull*** get printed
 Them banks get scoped out, black cars get rented
 My Gucci suit tailor, my fade get tapered
 You get sent to your maker, ***in’ around with my paper

 Part the red sea and red Louis Vuittons
 Who the don? Walk inside the club with all his Gucci on
 You’ve been warned
 Packing Heat like two Lebrons
 And my crew is strong as Cali kush
 It keep you higher than Heaven’s Arms

 Hard bottom Ferragamos, iq too much for mediocre convo
 I know a Farrakhan, oh three-story condo
 Ipod Shuffle in between Common, Jay Electronica (Elpadaro?)
 Armado, and last words of Paul Castellano
 Nothin’ but illest paper and bitches niggas I know
 Smokin’ Cheeba, feeding divas Mcdonald’s
 All the way in Milano, ashin’ out Cohibas
 Fuckin’ in that blue?, the nose like?
 Let a bitch get a breather, then she back hittin’ high notes
 Throwin’ Louis luggage at dealerships, *** a car note
 15’s in everything, beating like Harpo
 Rolling purple like Harpo, bitches by the car low
 They wana see Prince, I’m pulling strings like Carlos, Santana
 Now we in Magic (city), Atlanta
 Wipin’ Ciroq off my Loubi’s with my Gucci bandana

 Part the red sea and red Louis Vuittons
 Who the don? Walk inside the club with all his Gucci on
 You’ve been warned
 Packing Heat like two Lebrons
 And my crew is strong as Cali kush
 It keep you higher than Heaven’s Arms

 Kanye with Kim now, I’m happy for that nigga
 Disrespect him or his wife, ? I slap you for that nigga
 Grew up listenin’ to Pac, now I’m rappin’ for that nigga
 My brother been dead 20 years, now I’m trappin’ for that nigga
 God Flow like Pusha and ‘em, rose Phantom pushin’ ‘em
 Splittin’ Louisville Sluggers over and puttin’ kush in ‘em
 Ain’t forgot about the Twin Towers, I blame Bush for them
 Obama can’t speak on it ‘cus the government’s shushin’ him
 But that’s my nigga though, still stackin’ figures so
 One day I’m top 5 and I can politic with Jigga though
 I was just trying to Blueprint myself behind Jigga, though
 And all them all dishes, yo, bull***, thibodeaux
 He be where the Summer be, I be where the Winter go
 Tomahawk the Bugatti, Florida State Seminole
 I’m out here tryna win a penant though
 Never thought I’d be legendary, but *** it I’m in it so

 Part the red sea and red Louis Vuittons
 Who the don? Walk inside the club with all his Gucci on
 You’ve been warned
 Packing Heat like two Lebrons
 And my crew is strong as Cali kush
 It keep you higher than Heaven’s Arms
