                        Feeling so frustrated even antiquated
 'Cause you can't update me if I'm overrated
 So frustrated, so frustrated
 You can't update this You fly off the handle wait till I'm not there
 If you will fly off the handle wait till I'm not there
 'Cause I will talk, maybe you will listen
 But you won't hear a single word I say
 I will talk you will listen We have a house where I'm in your hair
 I'll go spare and leave you happy in there
 We have a house where I'm in your hair
 I'll go spare and leave you happy in there You fly off the handle wait till I'm not there
 If you will fly off the handle wait till I'm not there
 'Cause I will talk, maybe you will listen
 But you won't hear a single word I say
 I will talk you will listen
