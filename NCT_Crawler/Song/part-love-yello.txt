                        Mm mm mm mm
 I see you walk baby walk
 I hear you talk baby talk
 I see you dance baby dance
 Give me that chance baby chance Your eyes kill my sight
 I guess you know that (mm mm mm mm)
 I guess you know that
 Your eyes kill my sight (mm mm mm mm)
 I guess you know that (You make my heart burn)
 I guess you know that
 (You make my mind turn) Lazy lady way too cool
 I wanna be your supernatural tool
 Lazy lady way too cool
 I wanna be your supernatural fool
 Mm mm mm mm your supernatural tool This is your love part, you drive it into my heart
 Driving me out of my mind you make me love blind Your eyes
 Yeah! You make my heart burn, you make my mind turn
 This is your love part, you drive it into my heart
 Driving me out of my mind you make me love blind
