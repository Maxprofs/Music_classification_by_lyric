Yeah
You feel that baby?
Yeah I feel it too
Damn
You know
I'm so glad we could spend this time together
see
I'm not as crazy as you though I was, am I?

I'm the American dream
I'm the definition of white trash ballin
I'm right back on 'em with the rchick-rchick-chicka-chick
I can't call it, same *** different toilet
Oh yeah, got a nice ass darling
can't wait to get you into my benz
take you for a spin
whatchu mean we ain't ***in? You take me for a friend?
Lemme tell you the whole story of Shady's origin
You'll be sorry if you slam my Mercedes door again
Now, it all started with my father,
I musta got my pimpin genes from him,
the way he left my mama
I'm a rollin stone just like him,
word to Johnny Drama Keep my Entourage wit me,
baby I make a promise there ain't nobody as bomb as me,
I'm calm as the breeze I'm the bee's knees,
his legs and his arms I'm a superstar, I'm ready for you Mama,
Why you think the only thing I got on is my pyjamas?
So bad

I'm so good that I'm so bad
I guarantee I'll be the greatest thing you've ever had
Cos you ain't never met nobody like me
and you ain't gonna want to *** nobody else again
So bad
I'm so good that I'm so bad
I guarantee I'll be the greatest thing you've ever had
Cos you ain't never met nobody like me
and you ain't gonna want to *** nobody else again
I'm equivelent to a shot of ??
First I kiss your navel, work my way down
Baby you can lay down on the table
but you may want to find something more stable
i told you i ain't foolin from the gate, this ain't the first day of April
But thank you for staying April
Ima make you learn to appreciate me, differentiate me
from these phoney little fishy and sissy fake G's
skip over the huggie bear and all the kissy face please
initiate phase 3, missy now service me
take another shot of yager, shake it so nervously
take your time baby, ooh you're the bomb baby
ohh you're doing that even better than your mom, lady
i told you i'm shady, you didn't listen now did ya?
relax, woman, you know that i'm only kiddin with ya
got a twisted sense of humor, it's warped but i didn't hit ya
i think you're finally starting to get the picture, I'm just
So bad

I'm so good that I'm so bad
I guarantee I'll be the greatest thing you've ever had
Cos you ain't never met nobody like me
and you ain't gonna want to *** nobody else again

Make you recapture the feelings you had for
your last boyfriend before he slapped ya
You never wanted someone so bad you're
sweating, but if i'm what you wanted
why'd you panic when I grabbed ya?
girl don't be so frantic, I'm just a hopless romantic
don't tryta fight the feelin of something that's so organic
you can't ignore it, so don't, just stand before it
just drop them panties to the floor, lets get the cam cordin
damn shortie, i told you this is bound to happen
soon as you wrote your number on the napkin
i was bound to work a number on your back and
throw your spine out of allignment
my love has got you so blinded
you couldn't pick Amy Winehouse out of a lineup
so stop at the store and pick a pint up
lets get the pineapple schnapps goin
noone will kock cos ima hang a sign up
sayin don't disturb, shortie i'm so supurb
i say the right things, don't i spit the dopest words?!

So bad

I guarantee I'll be the greatest thing you've ever had
Cos you ain't never met nobody like me
and you ain't gonna want to *** nobody else again
