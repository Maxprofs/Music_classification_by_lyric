                        Bài hát: Take Me Home - Nick Carter, Jordan Knight

Who knew I was lost I was gone,
So confused
Just a stranger to love without you
I'm missing your familiar face
When you came gave me life, gave me love, gave me chance
Now I can't find the sun through the rain
It just seems so far away!

And you, you are the only one
Who can take away the pain!
So don't leave me waiting,
Don't leave me waiting ALL ALONE
Can somebody save me
I need you to take me take me take me take
TAKE ME HOME
TAKE ME HOME
To the place I know
TAKE ME HOME

I believe there's a light at the end of my dream
Every road, every path in the wind
Leads me right back to your eyes
Uuh, I just can't erase any kiss from the lips
Left the sweetest taste
You'd probably reading my darkest days
It's my only true escape!

And you, you are the only one
Who can take away the pain!
So don't leave me waiting,
Don't leave me waiting ALL ALONE
Can somebody save me
I need you to take me take me take me take
TAKE ME HOME
TAKE ME HOME
To the place I know

Oooh ooh ooh ooh
(x2)

TAKE ME HOME
DON'T LEAVE ME WAITING
DON'T LEAVE ME WAITING ALL ALONE

Can somebody save me
I need you to take me take me take me take
JUST TAKE ME HOME
TAKE ME HOME,
To the place I know
TAKE ME HOME!

Oooh ooh ooh ooh
(x2)

Just take me home
Take me home
Uuh yeah!
