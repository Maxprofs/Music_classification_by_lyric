[Intro]

[Verse 1]
They call me Deadpool, I'm hella fast
Came to merc the bad guys, and get some ass
Got blades for days, got guns galore
Got combo moves, evades and more
With bear traps and hand grenades
Pull the pistol like a maniac right in your face
Poppin off caps, leave a trail of guts
Sittin' on my chair, scratchin' my nuts
I can't die, I'm invincible
But if you'd like to try, then I'll crush your skull
Crass and rude, borderline obscene
But I'm the funniest mother***er that you ever did see
And Wolverine is gettin' bitch-slapped
"Wake up, Wolvey, no time for a nap."
We gotta rescue Rogue, ride a roller coaster
Grab our gear and head to Genosha
[Hook]

(Deadpool)

[Verse 2]
On a mission to slap a ho
But I'm gettin' kinda dizzy, fightin' Vertigo
So, slow the roll' you're kinda cute
But if you keep this game up then I'm gonna puke!
Hangin' with the ladies that are wearin' their skivvies
Motorboatin' and playin' with titties
Jump across the map in a big-ass boot
Decapitate my enemies, pick up my loot
Don't stop when I shoot, full-auto is on
Your ass is grass, and I'm mowin' the lawn
Hot lead to the head, and I won't stop
Domino and Psychlocke, makin' it hot
But all these bitches are primadonnas
I stuff my face with Chimmechangas
Taco's and beers, always keepin' it loose
Hang on for a minute while I'm droppin' a deuce
I'm 'bout to take you all to school with guns and knives
(Deadpool)
Tellin' jokes and breakin' the rules, I came for the taco's
(Deadpool)
Playin' with the ladies and my family jewels to bust a nut
(Deadpool)
'Bout to throw down with all these fools
So come and get some

[Verse 3]
My favorite girl, I call her Death
She got big ol' boobs and butt-ass breath
No stress, one day we will be together
Just as soon as I die (and that means never)
Hackin' and slashin', like a ninja
Don't worry, Sinister, I'm commin' to getcha
Double-flippin' jumps, landin' all wreckless
Sneakin' up on dudes and leavin' 'em headless
Cable any day, big gun, no doubt
But he talks too much, so *** it, I'm out
With a broken neck, I can't see at all
Crack it like a crackhead, problem solved
X-Men Evolved, doin' air guitar
Pettin' the dog, dancin' like a porn star
We did it! We rescued Rogue
I tried to get some booty, but I got friend-zoned
Teleport, because it's cool, when I fall off a ledge
(Deadpool)
The crazy-ass guards always lookin' to duel, so click, click, BOOM!
(Deadpool)
I don't believe in the Golden Rule, I came to get laid
(Deadpool)
Note to the ladies: I'm not a tool, I'm a sexy mother***er
(Sexy mother***er)
(Sexy mother***er)
(Sexy mother***er)
(Sexy mother***er)

[Outro]
(Deadpool)
(Deadpool)
(Deadpool)
(Dead... Pool...)
