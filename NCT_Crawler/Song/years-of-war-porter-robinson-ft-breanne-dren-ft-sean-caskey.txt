                        Take one last look at what you're leaving behind,
 'Cause there's no coming back once we go
 We are the children of an innocent crime,
 And its time to take down the throne
 Although their heads may shake,
 We'll set the city ablaze for their treachery
 We'll spill their blood and set our fathers free Ooh, two hundred years of war
 Fight till we are no more
 A curse on the streets of gold, ooh ooh
 Just know
 That mine is a hand to hold
 Take back what the kingdom stole
 A curse on the streets of gold Ooh, two hundred years of war
 Fight till we are no more
 A curse on the streets of gold, ooh ooh
 Just know
 That mine is a hand to hold
 Take back what the kingdom stole
 A curse on the streets of gold
                        
                    |
