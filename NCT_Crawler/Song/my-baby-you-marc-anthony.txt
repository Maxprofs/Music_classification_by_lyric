                        As I look into your eyes
I see all the reasons why
My life’s worth a thousand skies
You’re the simplest love I’ve known
And the purest one I’ll own
Know you’ll never be alone

Chorus:

My baby you
Are the reason I could fly
And 'cause of you
I don’t have to wonder why
Baby you
There’s no more just getting by
You’re the reason I feel so alive.

Though these words I sing are true
They still fail to capture you
As mere words can only do
How do I explain that smile?
And how it turns my world around
Keeping my feet on the ground

Repeat Chorus

I will soothe you if you fall
I’l be right there if you call
You’re my greatest love of all

Chorus
you are the reason I could fly 
and 'cause of you 
I don't have to wonder why
My baby you 
there's no more just getting by
'cause you're the reason I feel so alive
Arianna I feel so alive
                        
                    |
