                        Bài hát: Seal Me With A Kiss - Jessie J, De La Soul

I ain't gon' lie
If I just got one chance with you tonight
Then baby we would dance until it's light
Romance is in the plans

Ladies and gentlemen
Boys and girls
Do understand this is not your average girl from around the wave
It's (J-J-J-J)

Look at you over there
You know how to make me go wild wild wild, wild wild wild
Wanna do something that makes me crazy
Ooh, I want you now now now, now now now

Take me, love me with your lips
Slay me, seal me with a kiss
With, with, with a kiss
Seal me with a kiss
With, with, with a kiss
Seal me with a kiss

Look at you, sexy, cool
Read my mind I wanna us to get down down down, d-down down down
There's room for two so make your move (make your move)
Just me and you, there ain't no rules
Aloud, loud, loud
Aloud, loud, loud

(Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh) No good at lying
I'm excited
(Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh) Oh baby for you to come and

Take me, love me with your lips
Baby, seal me with a kiss
With, with, with a kiss
Seal me with a kiss
With, with, with a kiss
Seal me with a kiss

Have you actually had the audacity to think
You could strut past me with our lips trying to link
We know the lip service gets them
Tingling and nervous system
Every spot of ink on your legs and arms
Is all mine to charm and I plan to be in it
From every second of the minute

Miss Independent like record label contracts
To contacts of lips is lunar
Eclipse, the moon as soon as eyes clash
We strum at new tune makes myself fall knee deep in the stroke
Girl you know I can't sleep till I poke
Don't front, come creep with a bloke,
Let's go!

I ain't gon' lie (I ain't gon' lie)
If I just got one chance with you tonight (with you tonight)
Then baby we would dance until it's light (until it's light)
Romance is in the plans

All you gotta do is just be brave enough to come out

Take me, love me with your lips
Slay me, seal me with a kiss
With, with, with a kiss
Seal me with a kiss
With, with, with a kiss
Seal me with a kiss

Take me, love me with your lips
Slay me, seal me with a kiss
With, with, with a kiss
Seal me with a kiss
With, with, with a kiss
Seal me with a kiss

I ain't gon' lie
If I just got one chance with you tonight (What we gon' do?)
Then baby we would dance ("till when?) until it's light
Romance is in the plans (Yeah)
