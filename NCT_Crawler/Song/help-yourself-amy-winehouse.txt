                        Bài hát: Help Yourself - Amy Winehouse 

When I walk in your shoes
I understand a man confused
There must have been but I don't care
I feel the way your soul does there
Darling they empathise
Looking through your bloodshot eyes
And I know you you're so frustrated
Above we all become what we once hated
Be slight nobody can be that wise
I can't help ya if you won't help yourself
I can't help ya if you don't help yourself
You can only get so much from someone yeah
You can get so much from me
I can't help ya if you won't help yourself
You've got a degree a in philosophy
So you think you're cleverer than me
But I'm not just some drama queen
Cos it's where you're at not where you've been
So what do you expect from me
To hold your head above the sea
And there are you even though you're bigger
Cos don't you know you crush my tiny figure
And anyway we're still so young
And this isn't yet the day
I can't help ya if you won't help yourself
I can't help ya if you don't help yourself
You can only get so much from someone yeah
I can't help ya if you won't help yourself
You might be twenty-five but in my mind
I see you at sixteen years or most of the time
And I'm just a child and you're full grown
And no I'm nothing like I've ever known yeah
I'm nothing like I've ever known
                        
                    |
