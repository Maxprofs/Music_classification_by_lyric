                        You've seen so many faces that I've never seen before
 I left an un-rewarding message telling you to come on
 Over dramatic, automatically assume I'll stay the same There's a change in pressure
 We're never gonna lie to you
 (Change in pressure)
 My broken veins say that if my heart stops beating
 (Change in pressure)
 "We'll bleed the same way"
 (Change in pressure)
 Oh, my broken veins say Well I stay tuned, listen to the news and try to fall asleep at night
 Because I'm living in a house with just three walls
 So I'm always getting recognized There's a change in pressure
 We're never gonna lie to you
 (Change in pressure)
 My broken veins say that if my heart stops beating
 (Change in pressure)
 "We'll bleed the same way"
 (Change in pressure)
 Oh, my broken veins say (Change in pressure) There's a change in pressure
 We're never gonna lie to you
 (Change in pressure)
 My broken veins say that if my heart stops beating
 (Change in pressure)
 "We'll bleed the same way"
 (Change in pressure)
