Lyrics: Isozaki Takeshi
Composition: Isozaki Takeshi

Arukitsukarete tohou ni kureta
“Akarui mirai he” sensei wa iu kedo
Docchi ni aruitara hikari wa sasu kana?
Toriaezu wakaranai kedo yukou ze

Kireigoto nanka maji kanben desu
Itai kurai tsuyoi yatsu wo choudai
Arikitari na mainichi ni hankou desu
Tagire M I C oretachi no rock

Kimi no koe ga kikoeru
(wowowowowowowo)
Soredake wa RIARU sa hajikero
Kono uta

I can hear you are screaming×2
Tsukiugokasare shoudou no mama ni yoru wo kakenda
can’t you see?×3 my face
Kotoba ja nai ima dake wo kanjitetai kimi wo kanjitetai

Daitai wa daijoubusa umaku yarou ze
Fuan na toki wa ore ga tsuiteru
Dokka de hikatteru mirai wo mezashite
Kou yatte kangaeta koto wasurenai

Ima wo ike sono saki ga tomorrow
Kirai ja nai koudou surya OK
loud na shout hibikasen da do more rock
Itsuka B I G omoikiri jump

Motto kikasete kure yo

Negai wo komeru nda kibou no

Onnaji you na itami wo kakaete dakedo tobu nda

Egao ja nai kimi nanka ni shitakuna ihitoribocchi ja nai

I can hear you are screaming×2
Tsukiugokasare shoudou no mama ni yoru wo kakenda

Kotoba ja nai ima dake wo kanjitetai kimi wo kanjitetai

I can hear you are screaming×2
Sakebitsuzukete ashita no tobira wo kojiakeru nda

Dareka ja nai oretachi wo shinjitetai yume wo shinjitetai

TRANSLATION

I was at loss and tired of walking
but my teacher said "it's for a brighter future"
I wonder if light shines when I walk to this way?
I don't know for now but Let's Go!

Each hunch is something like a serious break,
It's painful but give me a strong guy
It's revolt everyday,
Pass the M I C We rock

I heard your voice
(wowowowowowowo)
Just like it's a reality
this song

I can hear you are screaming×2
I do came at night to leave a great impulse
can’t you see?×3 my face
It's not in words, I just want you to feel,to feel me now

If you're anxious, It's okay
I have string attached to you, 
maybe it's different but it's the thought
of aiming for sparkling future somewhere

Now, it's far ahead our tomorrow
Ok it's not hate anymore
Loud & Shout counting more more rock
Something B I G All One's might JUMP

Let me hear more
(wowowowowowowo)
I'm putting my wish and hope
to this song

I can hear you are screaming×2
I've been having similar pain but I can fly
come with me×3 my friend
You can't smile but you want something that is you don't want to be 

alone

I can hear you are screaming×2
I do came at night to leave a great impulse
can’t you see?×3 my face
It's not in words, I just want you to feel,to feel me now

I can hear you are screaming×2
If you cry now, I break and open the door of tomorrow
don’t worry×3 baby
Without anyone else, We should believe and dream to believe
                        
                    |
