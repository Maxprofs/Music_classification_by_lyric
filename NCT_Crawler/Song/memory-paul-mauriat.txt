 : 《Snow Rose eXce》

Midnight,
not a sound from the pavement.
Has the moon lost her mem\'ry.
She is smiling alone.
In the lamplight,
the withered leaves collect at my feet.
And the wind
begins to moan.
Mem\'ry,
all alone in the moonlight.
I can smile at the old days
life was beautiful then
I remember
the time I knew what happiness was
Let the mem\'ry
live again.
Ev\'ry street lamp
seems to beat
a fatalistic warning.
Someone mutters
and a street lamp gutters
and soon it will be morning.
Daylight,
I must wait for the sunrise.
I must think of a new life
and I mustn\'t give in.
When the dawn comes,
tonight will be a memory too
And a new day will begin
............
............MUSIC............
............
Burnt out ends of
smoky days,
The stale cold smell of morning
The street lamp dies,
another night is over;
another day is dawning.
Touch me,
It\'s so easy to leave me.
All alone with my mem\'ry
of my days in the sun.
If you touch me,
you\'ll understand what happiness is Look
A new day
has begun.
