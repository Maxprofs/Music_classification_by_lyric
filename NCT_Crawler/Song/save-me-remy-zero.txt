                        i feel my wings have broken 
in your hands
i feel the words unspoken 
inside
when they pull you under
and i would give you any thing you want, no
you were all i wanted
all my dreams are fallin' down
crawlin' round (and round and round)

chorus:
somebody save me
and two warm hands break right through
somebody save me
i don't care how you do it
just stay, stay
come on
i've been waiting for you

i see the world has folded in your heart
i feel the waves crash down inside
and they pull me under
and i would give you anything you want
you're, you're all i wanted
all my dreams have fallen down
crawlin round (and round and round)

repeat chorus

And all my dreams are on the ground..
crawlin' round (and round and round)

somebody save me
and two warm hands break right through
somebody save me
i dont' care how you do it
just stay here with me
i've made this whole world shine for you
just stay, stay
come on
i'm still waiting for you

somebody save me
and two warm hands break right through
somebody save me
i dont' care how you do it
just stay here with me
i've made this whole world shine for you
just stay, stay
come on
i'm still waiting for you
                        
                    |
