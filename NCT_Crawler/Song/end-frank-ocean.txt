                        Darker times
 Theyre telling boulder heavy lies
 Looks like all weve got is each other
 The truth is obsolete
 Remember when all I had was my mother
 She didnt compromise
 She could recognize
 Voodoo
 Our daughters and our sons
 Are just candles in the sun
 Voodoo
 Dont let him see divide
 Dont you let her see divide
 Voodoo
 Shes got the whole wide world in her juicy fruit
 Hes got the whole wide world in his pants
 He wrapped the whole wide world in a wedding band
 Then put the whole wide world on her hands
 Shes got the whole wide world in her hands
 Hes got the whole wide world in his hands
 There's somethin' about you
 I can't believe I'm even talking to you, tellin' me this right now
 You're special
 I wish you could see what I see
