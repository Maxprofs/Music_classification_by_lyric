                        Uh ha, oh oh oh oh.
All dressed up you're good to go,
Checkin' your style from head to toe,
Hooked up and natural,
Your feeling beautiful.

Nine times out of ten you know,
Late night club, like a video,
With the hot stuff, the top stuff,
Yo we got stuff, Woah ooh woah.

What a night (Night), So far (Far),
Pulling up curb side in your car (Your car),
What a sight (Sight), You are (Are),
Think I know somewhere we can park,
After Dark.

Chorus x2

System up with the top down,
Got the city on lockdown,
Drive by in the low ride,
Hands high when we fly by.

Girl it's time to let you know,
I'm down if you wanna go,
We can take it nice and slow,
We got until tomorrow,
UK style UK flow,
We got you hot like (Woah),
With the hot stuff,
The top stuff,
Yo we got stuff,
Woah ooh woah.

What a night (Night),
So far (Far),
Pulling up curb side in your car (Your car),
What a sight (Sight),
You are (Are),
Think I know somewhere we can park,
After Dark.

Chorus x2

Throw your hands in the sky wave 'em side to side,
Let me see you shake your body all at the same time,
Throw your hands in the sky wave 'em side to side,
Let me see you shake your body all at the same time,

What a night, So far,
Pulling up curb side in your car,
What a si---ght you are,
Think I know somewhere we can park,
After Dar-------k.

Chorus ending

Fly by, Fly by, Fly by, Fly by.
