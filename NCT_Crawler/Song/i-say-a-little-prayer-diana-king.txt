                        Say a little prayer for you
 Me I go say a little prayer for you
 Say a little prayer for you
 Me I go say a little prayer for you From the moment me wake up
 Before me put on me make up
 Me say a little prayer for you Me combing me hair now
 And me wonderin' which dress me wear now
 Me say a little prayer for you Forever and ever, you'll stay in my heart
 And I'll love you, forever and ever
 We never will part and I'll love you
 Together, together, that's how it should be
 Without you would only mean heartbreak for me Me run for the bus, love
 Me ridin' me think for us, love
 Me say a little prayer for you At work I just take time
 And all through my coffee break time
 Me say a little prayer for you Forever and ever, you'll stay in my heart
 And I'll love you, forever and ever
 We never will part and I'll love you
 Together, together, that's how it should be
 Without you would only mean heartbreak for me Say a little prayer for you
 Me I go say a little prayer for you
 Say a little prayer for you
 Me I go say a little prayer for you Forever Forever and I love you
 Forever and I love you
 Forever and I love you
 Forever Me say a little prayer for you, ohh Forever and ever, you'll stay in my heart
 And I'll love you, forever and ever
 We never will part and I'll love you
 Together, together, that's how it should be
 And I'll love you Forever and ever, you'll stay in my heart
 And I'll love you, forever and ever
 We never will part and I'll love you
 Together, together, that's how it should be
 Without you would only mean heartbreak for me Forever and ever, you'll stay in my heart
 And I'll love you, forever and ever
 We never will part and I'll love you
