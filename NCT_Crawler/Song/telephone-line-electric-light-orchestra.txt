                        Hello, how are you? Have you been alright?
 Through all those lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely nights
 That's what I'd say, I'd tell you everything
 If you'd pick up that telephone, yeah yeah yeah Hey, how you feelin'? Are you still the same?
 Don't you realize the things we did, we did
 Were all for real, not a dream? And I just can't believe
 They've all faded out of view, yeah yeah yeah Doowop dooby doo doowop, doowah doolang
 Blue days, black nights, doowah doolang I look into the sky
 The love you need ain't gonna see you through
 And I wonder why
 The little things you planned ain't coming true Oh oh, telephone line, give me some time
 I'm living in twilight
 Oh oh, telephone line, give me some time
 I'm living in twilight Okay, so no one's answering
 Well, can't you just let it ring a little longer, longer, longer, longer, oh
 I'll just sit tight through shadows of the night
 But let it ring for evermore, yeah yeah yeah, oh oh Doowop dooby doo doowop, doowah doolang
 Blue days, black nights, doowah doolang I look into the sky
 The love you need ain't gonna see you through
 And I wonder why
 The little things you planned ain't coming true Oh oh, telephone line, give me some time
 I'm living in twilight
 Oh oh, telephone line, give me some time
 I'm living in twilight Oh oh, telephone line, give me some time
 I'm living in twilight
 Oh oh, telephone line, give me some time
 I'm living in twilight
