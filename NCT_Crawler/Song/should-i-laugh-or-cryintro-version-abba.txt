                        Bài hát: Should I Laugh Or Cry(Intro Version) - ABBA 

He stands towering over me beside my bed
Losing his head
Tells me i must take him seriously
Rambling on the usual way
He's such a clever guy
Then i wonder, should i laugh or cry?
He's dressed in the striped pyjamas that i bought
Trousers too short
ABBA
Gives me all his small philosophies
Carries on the way he does
And me i get so tired
And i wonder should i laugh or cry
High and mighty his banner flies
A fool's pride in his eyes
Standing there on his toes to grow in size
All i see is a big balloon
Halfway up to the moon
He's wrapped up in a warm and safe cocoon
Of an eternal lie
So should i laugh or cry?
Strange how dangerously indifferent i have grown
Cold as a stone
No more pain where there was pain before
Far away he rambles on
I feel my throat go dry
And i wonder, should i laugh or cry?
High and mighty his banner flies
A fool's pride in his eyes
Standing there on his toes to grow in size
All i see is a big balloon
Halfway up to the moon
He's wrapped up in a warm and safe cocoon
Of an eternal lie
So should i laugh or cry?
