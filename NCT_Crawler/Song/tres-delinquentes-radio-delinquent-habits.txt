                        I fix my bass goes hardcore
 Down for cleek-hi
 Whose that enemeny pump through the speaker
 Bass gets to pumping rutas get to pump it
 Who's that rap king gets the party stop jumpin
 Blasting too high, no need for the bulla
 I hammer with the one knock the last shot through ya
 Step to the crowd I fell the strain
 Throw your nezos in the moshpit feel the pain
 So don't get in my way baby
 Because the loco is the one here to play baby
 My ***'ll pump up a jam, god damn it's the baddest
 Tres delinguente's step into the madness

 (horns)

 Ya undas muchacho a vienes te miro
 Si me traes bronca me loco de aqui-yo
 Me paro te tumbo no es tu rumbo
 Y con en lingo talvez te confundo
 She stay 5 with the 5 foot 10
 One blaxican once again with the cocktail pin
 As I emerge from the deapths all around my son
 Back lack yack crack hope to run
 Altravest in the chest and the crews so much stress
 One blaxican on the scrongy old test
 Hittin heart like a nastic swift like a zooloo
 That's what it's like when a palm shot through you
 My manarism miled till the punks get piled
 My number one assasin fits the mad funk style
 Me I play the back rode but I'm delinquente
 This is how I freak it when I'm speakin to the hente

 (horns)

 Watcha ducha seme tres cooncha
 Someones delinquente still a que de lucha
 Freaky disces equals san oray
 O G freaks the beat the manyachees play
 Fade it in snap on a essaw 10
 Produce the mach may haw so G style I can
 Freaky pumpin bass out the carro
 Oh gee he's got more boom boom than Charlo
 3rd is tres bring cuts to your face
 Hold down the nino with the penny to his waist
 See all the style used to create

 (horns)

 That's Spanish?
 No, that wasn't Spanish that was English
 No, uh uh, that, that was Spanish
