Everybody's Kung Fu fighting!
I tell you what we fighting!
I know it little bit frightening!
Our it's our lining.

For the battle of feast
Cause the battle of mine
When you don't know who you are!
Just look inside 
Come'n
When we moving to the floor
We always gonna win
For the power this know
They show you let did it.

Everybody's Kung Fu fighting!
I tell you what we fighting!
I know it little bit frightening!
Our it's our lining.

And we keep moving with the floor
You can walk can you can go
Hundred felcher this
Let's make a go
Demise out of take
The last really help
When it come at the G
You got to give it back.

Everybody's Kung Fu fighting!
I tell you what we fighting!
I know it little bit frightening!
Our it's our lining (x2)

Whoa whoa whoaaaaa (x4)
