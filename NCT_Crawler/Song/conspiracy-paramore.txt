Conspiracy
Paramore
All We Know Is Falling

......

please speak softly
or they will hear us
and they'll find out
why we don't trust them
Speak up dear
'cause I cannot hear you
I need to know
why we don't trust them

Explain to me
this conspiracy against me, yeah
And tell me how
I lost my power, oh yeah

Where can I turn
'cause I need something more
Surrounded by uncertianty
I'm so unsure of...
Tell me why I feel so alone
'cause I need to know
to whom do I owe

Explain to me
this conspiracy against me, yeah
And tell me how
I lost my power, oh yeah

I thought
you would make it
because you said
that we'd make it through
And when all security fails
you'd be there
to help me through

Explain to me
this conspiracy against me, yeah
And tell me how
I lost my power, oh
