                        Song: Fly Away - TheFatRat, Anjulie

Come and fly away with me,
Come and fly away with me-e-e-e-e,
Come and fly away with me,
Co-co-come and fly away with me-e-e-e-e-e-e,
Come and fly away with me,
Come and fly away with me-e-e-e-e,
Come and fly away with me,
Co-co-come and fly away with me-e-e-e-e-e-e,
Don’t you be afraid everything will change,
You and I,
Jumping of the edge,
They say dreamers never die,
So, come and fly,
Come and fly,
Come and fly away with me,
We’re rising, we’re falling,
We’ll make it through,
We’re climbing, we’re soaring,
A thousand views,
We’re rising, we’re falling,
We’ll make it through,
We’re climbing, we’re soaring,
A thousand views,
Somewhere by the emerald sea,
Where the moon and water meet,
Somewhere close to harmony,
When the world is sound asleep,
Somethings gonna bring a change, 
Journeys we are meant to take, 
Something at the edge of space, 
Calling us to fly away,
Don’t you be afraid,
Everything will change,
You and I,
Jumping of the edge,
They say dreamers never die,
So, come and fly,
Come and fly,
Come and fly away with me,
We’re rising, we’re falling,
We’ll make it through,
We’re climbing, we’re soaring,
A thousand views,
We’re rising, we’re falling,
We’ll make it through,
We’re climbing, we’re soaring,
A thousand views,
Come and fly away,
Come and,
Come and fly away,
Come and fly away with me,
Come and fly away,
Come and,
Come and fly away,
Come and fly away with me,
Somethings gonna bring a change, 
Journeys we are meant to take, 
Something at the edge of space, 
Calling us to fly away?
                        
                    |
