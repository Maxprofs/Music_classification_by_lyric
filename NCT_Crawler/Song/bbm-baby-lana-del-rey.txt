                        Bài hát: BBM Baby - Lana Del Rey

I be BBM'in you
Telling you
All the things I'm gonna do to you
When you get home babe
Makin love then yelling ooh
Nothin I would rather do
Then flirt and talkin dirty, you
Love me, hate me

It's like it's your job to work me up
Treatin me nice, and then treatin me rough
And I don't know why, but I can't get enough
I like it, I like it
And I know that I'm making you nuts
Middle of the night and when I'm waking up
I don't know why, but you can't get enough
You like it, you like it

Be my BBM baby
Middle of the night, waking up to ride
Be my BBM baby
I don't wanna fight, you're the one I like
Yeah yeah, always on my mind
Yeah yeah, when will you be mine

I be BBM'in you
Lettin you love me in your letters
Though the way that you write is crazy
Your typing this poetical
Red roses in your message oh
I think I met my match in you
Text me, chase me

It's like it's your job to work me up
Treatin me nice and then treatin me rough
And I don't know why, but I can't get enough
I like it, I like it
He signs XO, hugs, hey
I know it's true love cause my heart goes yay

Be my BBM baby
Middle of the night, waking up to ride
Be my BBM baby
I don't wanna fight, you're the one I like
Yeah yeah, you're always on my mind
Yeah yeah, when will you be mine

He signs XO, hugs, hey
I know it's true love cause my heart goes yay
He signs xx, kiss, babe

I don't wanna fight
Boy you got me crazed
In the middle of the night
He writes that he's outside
I left my window open baby
You can come inside
Call me when you get here
I'll be ready boy
Cause I heart you, you're the one that I adore

So won't you be my BBM baby
Middle of the night, wakin up to ride
So won't you be my BBM baby
I don't wanna fight, you're the one I like
Be my BBM baby
Middle of the night, wakin' up to ride
Oh won't you be my BBM baby
I don't wanna fight, you're the one I like
Yeah yeah, you're always on my mind
Yeah yeah, when will you be mine
Yeah yeah, you're always on my mind
Yeah yeah, when will you be mine
