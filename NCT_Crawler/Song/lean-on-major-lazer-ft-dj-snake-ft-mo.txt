                        Bài hát: Lean On - Major Lazer, Dj Snake, MO

1. Do you recall not long ago 
We would walk on the sidewalk
Innocent, remember ? 
All we did was care for each other 
But the night was warm, we were born and young 

All around the wind blows 
We would only hold on to let go 

[Chorus x2]:
Blow a kiss, fire a gun 
We need someone to lean on. 
Blow a kiss, fire a gun 
We need is somebody to lean on 

2. What will we do when we get old 
Will walk down the same road?
Will you be there by my side? 
Standing strong as the waves roll over 
When the nights are long 
Longing for you to come home 

All around the wind blows 
We would only hold on to let go 

[ Chorus x2]:
Blow a kiss, fire a gun
We need someone to lean on 
Blow a kiss, fire a gun
We need is somebody to lean on 

All we need somebody to lean on (x2)

[Chorus x2] 

All we need is somebody to lean on
                        
                    |
