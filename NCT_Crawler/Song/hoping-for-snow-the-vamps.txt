                        Bài hát: Hoping For Snow - The Vamps

I've made mistakes but so of you
it's been a year of nothing new
and now I'm waiting for this to unfold

They're raising clouds but at my tide
I keep on waving spirits high
if you don't open to me in the cold

And no, you're not the only reason I came home
and maybe it's the seasons I don't know
and maybe it's because I'm on my own

Last year you took a piece of my heart
this year I guess it's falling appart
Everyone's hoping for snow
but I'm just hoping that you come home

Last year we stole a dance in the dark,
this year we're just a thought from up far
Everyone's hoping for snow
but I'm just hoping that you might make it home

I catch a breath it chills my lungs,
it takes me back to when we were young
I always seem to get lost in the past

As I let go I ́ll breathe you out
before my eyes it form a cloud and
dissappear when you stick to the glass

Oh, you're not the only reason I came home
and maybe it's the seasons I don't know
and maybe it's because I'm on my own

Last year you took a piece of my heart
this year I guess it's falling appart
Everyone's hoping for snow
but I'm just hoping that you come home

Last year we stole a dance in the dark,
this year we're just a thought from up far
Everyone's hoping for snow
but I'm just hoping that you might make it home

I see you out, out in the street
and nothing on your face shows that you're missing me
and all our friends from way back when
keep asking me just how you've been and how I've been, and it's killing me

Last year you took a piece of my heart
this year I guess it's falling appart
Everyone's hoping for snow
but I'm just hoping that you did come home

Last year you took a piece of my heart
this year I guess it's falling appart
Everyone's hoping for snow
but I'm just hoping that you come home

Last year we stole a dance in the dark,
this year we're just a thought from up far
Everyone's hoping for snow
but I'm just hoping that you might make it home
