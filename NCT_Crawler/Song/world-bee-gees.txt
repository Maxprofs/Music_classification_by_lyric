Now I've Found That The World Is Round
And Of Course It Rains Everyday
Living Tomorrow
Where In The World Will I Be Tomorrow
How Far Am I Able To See
Or Am I Needed Here
If I Remember
All Of The Things I Have Done
I Remember
All Of The Times I've Gone Wrong
Why Do They Keep Me Here
Now I've Found That The World Is Round
And Now I've Found That The World Is Round
