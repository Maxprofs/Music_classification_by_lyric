                        Bài hát : Marilyn Monroe - Pharrell Williams

This one goes out to all the lovers
What can we do?
We're helpless romantics
We can not help
Who we're attracted to
So let's all dance
And elevate each other
(Chorus)
Dear diary, it's happening again
This enegy
Like i'm 'bout to win
I just close my eyes and visions appear
She's everything i want
And it's crytal clear
Not even Marilyn Monroe (Marilyn Monroe)
Queen Cleopatra, please (Cleopatra, please)
Not even Joan of Arc (Joan of Arc)
That don't mean nothin' to me
I just want a different girl
***
Girl x6
Can't another good boy keep it this thorough
Why?
Why do i have to lie?
Pretend, make believe or hide her?
When i love what i've described
But then again
I don't need no adjectives for this girl
(Chorus)
Girl x6
Girl and girl, girl x6
Can't another good boy keep it this thorough
In honor of the groove
And all who's surrendered to it
We said thank you
And we take it back
We're so hard
I was so hard that they can't chew
Then my lucky star
I guess you came from behind the moon
I put my arms around her
And i promise not to abuse you
Since now i found you
Why the hell would i want to lose you?
(Chorus)
Girl x6, girl oh girl, girl x6
Can't another good boy keep it this thorough
                        
                    |
