                        Bài hát: My Mother - Lara Fabian, Igor Krutoy

She spent her lifetime taking care of you
She slept at just a night or two
She always hide her pain behind a smile
Mothers never cry
As you were growing up you made her proud
In you both of your hearts were tied
That special love you share will last way beyond this life
Mothers never die
Mama moya
I'm a better person thanks to your love
I'm a better soul since I am your child
This world is a safer ground
When you hold my hand I fly, mama ya
I have not seen tangled line, mama ya
In the mirror of your eyes I see love/life
Aging with natural grace
Let me hold you, mama ya
When I am lost you guide my every step
And you dry every tear I shed
You are the woman I want to become
Fair, loyal and strong
Tell me the secrets of your shining smile
of every virtue you deny
The patience you have helped me with
Help me through the rain
Spare me most a pain
Mama moya
I'm a better person thanks to your love
I'm a better soul since I am your child
This world is a safer ground
When you hold my hand I fly, mama ya
I have not seen tangled line, mama ya
In the mirror of your eyes I see love/life
Aging with natural grace
Mama, ya lyublyu tebya
Mama, ya lyublyu tebya
