Alexis Jordan - High Road

I'm never out of place
Where I can turn around and walk away
'Cause in my mind I wanna slap your face
But I know if I do, I'm gonna catch a case
Just can't go 'round thinkin'
You can do what you wanna do
It ain't like that
I'm comin' after you
You'll see that
This ain't your party
Take it down 'cause you ain't nobody
I'm unaccountable
Believe that
So sick and tired of you
My emotions are in control
I'm takin' the high road

Oh, I wanna walk in the club
With my heels on
Oh, I wanna say, "shut up"
But that'll be wrong, wrong
Oh, I really like to make a scene
I'mma put on a show
I really don't act this way
I'm takin' the high road, road, road
I'm takin' the high road, road, road

I told you one more time
But you must have thought I was a punk with mine
Now I wanna fight you 'cause you let me believe
That you have your heart so locked up in me
Just can't go 'round thinkin'
You can do what you wanna do
It ain't like that
I'm comin' after you
You'll see that
This ain't your party
Take it down 'cause you ain't nobody
I'm unaccountable
Believe that
So sick and tired of you
My emotions are in control
I'm takin' the high road
Oh, I wanna walk in the club
With my heels on
Oh, I wanna say, "shut up"
But that'll be wrong, wrong
Oh, I really like to make a scene
I'mma put on a show
I really don't act this way
I'm takin' the high road, road, road
I'm takin' the high road, road, road

You stole my love from me
And just let it go and now I'm hurting
But you want do that no more,
I'm here to teach you
A lesson that's valuable
so you won't forget no more, oh

Oh, I wanna walk in the club
With my heels on
Oh, I wanna say, "shut up"
But that'll be wrong, wrong
Oh, I really like to make a scene
I'mma put on a show
I really don't act this way
I'm takin' the high road, road, road
I'm takin' the high road, road, road
I'm takin' the high road, road, road
I'm takin' the high road, road, road
