[00:-2.00]Lenka - Heart Skips A Beat
[00:-1.00]

Heart skips a beat,
My heart skips a beat.

My heart is playing stricks on me
And it's building bricks on me
I can't break through
And I can't face you

My world is turning slowly now
But it's burning up somehow
I need some time
To know what's right
'Cause it's only in the quiet that I feel some relief

I'm trying hard not to resist the joy
Don't listen to me I'm being paranoid
I might try hard but it's too hard to avoid
My heart skips a beat
My heart skips a beat

My heart is always first to know
And as the feeling grows
I can't deny,
Push those thoughts aside
My world is full of loveliness
But I focus on the stress
My heart says, \"Go\"
But my brain says, \"No\"
And it's only in the quiet that I hear myself breathe

I'm trying hard not to resist the joy
Don't listen to me I'm being paranoid
I might try hard but it's too hard to avoid
My heart skips a beat
My heart skips a beat
My heart skips a beat
My heart skips a beat

Oh, I know this time 'cause it's physical (ha ha ha)
My blood has stopped and I am breathless as well (ha ha ha)
But I need a minute to convince myself
'Cause it's only in the quiet that I know what to feel

I'm trying hard not to resist the joy
Don't listen to me I'm being paranoid
I might try hard but it's too hard to avoid
My heart skips a beat
My heart skips a beat

I'm trying hard not to resist the joy
Don't listen to me I'm being paranoid
I might try hard but it's too hard to avoid
My heart skips a beat
My heart skips a beat
My heart skips a beat
My heart skips a beat
