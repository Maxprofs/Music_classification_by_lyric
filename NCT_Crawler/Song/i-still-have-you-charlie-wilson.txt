                        Bài hát: I Still Have You - Charlie Wilson

What good is a million dollars and a home
Without someone to share and give
What good is a bed if you're sleeping all alone
I'm so happy 'cause with you I'm never lonely

Even if it stops snowing in winter
Never see another white christmas
We would go through it together
Baby you can count on that

If all the stars started hiding
And we couldn't make a wish again
Even if the sun stopped shining
I wouldn't care because

[Chorus:]
I still have you baby
And you have me too baby
I still have you babe
And you have me too ye
I'll be okay as long as I still have you

What good is a fancy car with nowhere to go
You're just driving down an empty road
One thing for sure is my arms was made to hold
And these lips were made for you, so baby kiss me yes

Even if it stops snowing in winter
Never see another white christmas
We would go through it together
Baby you can count on that

If all the stars started hiding
And we couldn't make a wish again
Even if the sun stopped shining
I wouldn't care because

[Chorus:]
I still have you baby
And you have me too baby
I still have you babe
And you have me too ye
I'll be okay as long as I still have you

Things may come and things may go
But I still have your, (lalalalalalalala love)
Seasons change I lose some friends
But I still have your, (lalalalalalalala love)
When my world is upside down
I still have your, (lalalalalalalala love)
Said I still have you
And you got me too

Even if it stops snowing in winter
Never see another white christmas
We would go through it together
Baby you can count on that

If all the stars started hiding
And we couldn't make a wish again
Even if the sun stop shining
You know I wouldn't care because

[Chorus: x2]
I still have you baby
And you have me too baby
I still have you baby
And you have me too ye
I'll be okay as long as I still have you
                        
                    |
