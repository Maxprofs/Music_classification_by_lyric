<< All In Your Mind >>
Artist: Mariah Carey

Come closer
You seem so far away
There's something I know you need to say
I feel your emotions
When I look in your eyes
Your silence
Whispering misunderstandings
There's so much you need to realize
You'll feel my emotions
If you look in my eyes
Hey darlin'
I know you think my love is slipping away
But baby it's all in your mind
Don't worry
Hold on tight and hear me when I say
Baby it's all in your mind
Believe me
I believe in you
There's nothing this feeling couldn't do
Move closer my darling
Feel the love in my eyes
Yeah...
I know you feel my love
When I know you think my love is slipping away
Yeah
(Baby it's all in your mind)
(END)
