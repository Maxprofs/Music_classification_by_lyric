I've had a little bit too much
All of the people start to rush (start to rush by) 
A dizzy twister dance 
Can't find my drink or man 
Where are my keys?
I lost my phone

What's goin’ on, on the floor?
I love this record baby but I can't see straight anymore keep it cool What’s the name of this club?
I can't remember but its alright, a-alright

Chorus: 
JUST DANCE!
Gonna be okay
Da da doo doot-n
JUST DANCE!
Spin that record babe
Da da doo doot-n
JUST DANCE!
Gonna be okay
D-d-d dance, dance, dance, just
J-J-JUST DANCE!

Wish I could shut my playboy mouth
How'd I turn my shirt inside out (inside out right) 
Control your poison babe 
Roses have thorns they say, 
And we’re all getting’ hosed tonight!

What's goin’ on, on the floor?
I love this record baby but I can't see straight anymore keep it cool What’s the name of this club?
I can't remember but its alright, a-alright

Chorus


When I come through on the dance floor checkin' out that catalogue
Can't believe my eyes so many women without a flaw
And I ain't gonna give it up, steady trying to pick it up like a call
I'm a hit it up beat it up latch on to it until tomorrow 

Shorty I can see that you got so much energy
The way you twirlin' up them hips round and round
And there is no reason that at all why you can't leave here with me
In the mean time stay let me watch you break it down and

Chorus

Hal f psychotic sick hypnotic got my blueprint its symphonic 
Half psychotic sick hypnotic got my blueprint electronic 
Half psychotic sick hypnotic got my blueprint its symphonic 
Half psychotic sick hypnotic got my blueprint electronic

Go! Your your muscle car-ve it out work it, hustle!
Don't Slow! Drive it, clean it lysol, bleed it 
Spend the last dough in your pocko!
