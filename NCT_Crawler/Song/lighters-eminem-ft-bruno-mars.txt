                        [Bruno Mars - Chorus]

This one's for you and me
Living out our dreams
We're all right where we should be
Lift my arms out wide
I open my eyes
And now all I wannna see
Is a sky full of lighters, a sky full of lighters

[Eminem]

By the time you hear this I will have already spiralled up
I would never do nothing to let you cowards * my world up
If I was you, I would duck, or get struck like lightening,
Fighters keep fighting, put your lighters up, point em’ skyward uh
Had a dream I was king, I woke up, still king
This rap game’s nipple is mine for the milking,
Till nobody else even *ing feels me, till’ it kills me
I swear to god I’ll be the *ing illest in this music
There is or there ever will be, disagree?
Feel free, but from now on I’m refusing to ever give up
The only thing I ever gave’s using no more excuses
Excuse me if my head is too big for this building
And pardon me if I’m a cocky * but you cocks are slick
Poppin * on how you flipped ya life around, crock-o- *
Who you dicks try to kid, flipped dick, you did the opposite
You stayed the same, cause cock backwards is still cock you *s
I love it when I tell em shove it
Cause it wasn’t that long ago when Marshall sat, luster lacked, lustered
Cuz he couldn’t cut mustard, muster up nothing
Brain fuzzy, cause he’s buzzin’, woke up from that buzz
Now you wonder why he does it, how he does it
Wasn’t cause he had buzzards circle around his head
Waiting for him to drop dead, was it?
Or was it, cause them bitches wrote him off
Little hussy ass, cause f-ck it, guess it doesn’t matter now, does it
What difference it make?
What it take to get it through your thick skulls
As if this aint some bull *
People don’t usually come back this way
From a place that was dark as I was in
Just to get to this place
Now let these words be like a switch blade to a haters rib cage
And let it be known from this day forward
I wanna just say thanks cause your hate is what gave me the strength
So let em bic’s raise cause I came with 5’9′ but I feel like I’m 6’8′′

[Bruno Mars - Chorus]

This one's for you and me
Living out our dreams
We're all right where we should be
Lift my arms out wide
I open my eyes
And now all I wannna see


Is a sky full of lightets, a sky full of lighters

[Bruno Mars - Bridge]

You and I know what it's like to be kicked down
Forced to fight
But tonight we’re alright
So hold up your light
Let it shine

[Bruno Mars - Chorus]

Cuz this one's for you and me
Living out our dreams
We're all right where we should be
Lift my arms out wide
I open my eyes
And now all I wannna see
Is a sky full of lightets, a sky full of lighters
