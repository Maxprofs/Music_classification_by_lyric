                        I wonder should I go or should I stay
 The band had only one more song to play
 And then I saw you out the corner of my eye
 A little girl, alone and so shy I had the last waltz with you
 Two lonely people together
 I fell in love with you
 The last waltz should last forever But the love we had was goin' strong
 And through the good and bad we get along
 And then the flame of love died in your eyes
 My heart was broke in two when you said goodbye I had the last waltz with you
 Two lonely people together
 Oh, I fell in love with you
 The last waltz should last forever It's all over now, nothing left to say
 Just my tears and the orchestra playin' La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
 La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la I had the last waltz with you
 Two lonely people together
 I fell in love with you
 The last waltz should last forever
 La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
