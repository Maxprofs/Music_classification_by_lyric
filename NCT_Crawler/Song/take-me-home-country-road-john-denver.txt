                        Country roads, take me home
To the place I belong
West Virginia, mountain Mamma
Take me home, country roads.

Almost heaven, west virginia, Blue ridge mountain
Shenandoah river. Life is old there, older than the trees
Younger than the mountains, growing like a breeze.
Country roads, take me home
To the place I belong
West Virginia, mountain Mamma
Take me home, country roads.
All my memories gathered around her
Miner's lady, stranger to blue water
Dark and dusty, painted on the sky
Misty taste of moonshine . Teardrops in my eyes.
Country road, take me home
To the place I belong
West Virginia, mountain Mamma
Take me home, country road.
I hear her voice in the morning hour she calls me
The radio reminds me of my home far away
And drivin' down the road I get a feelin'
That I should have been home yesterday, yesterday.
Country road, take me home
To the place I belong
West Virginia, mountain Mamma
Take me home, country road.
