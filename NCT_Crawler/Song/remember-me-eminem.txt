R&B/Hip Hop/Rap|

                        Remember me? ("There been executions")
 Remember me? ("I have no remorse")
 Remember me? ("I'm high, power!")
 Remember me? ("I drop bombs like Hiroshima") For this, why it's the X, you retarded?
 'Cause I grab the mic and get down, like syndrome
 Hide in Rome and to the masses, without boundaries
 Which qualifies me for the term "universal"
 Without no rehearsal, colleague words is controversial
 Like I'm not, the one you want to contest, see
 'Cause I'll hit your ass like the train did that bitch
 That got "Banned From TV"
 Heavyweight get up, watch you're whole head split up
 Loco is the motion, weed comin' through
 Hollow tips in the lead, the .45 through Remember me? ("Throw ya guns in the air!")
 Remember me? ("Slam! Slam!")
 Remember me? ("Nigga back da *** up!")
 Remember me? ("Chka-chka-Onyx!") Niggas catchin' "no" for an answer, ghetto no
 Yeah, I've been told no but it's more like
 "No, no, no!!"
 Life's a bitch, yeah it'll *** you if you let her
 Better come better than better to be a competitor
 This ved is a head, the *** is all redder, you deader and deader
 I better extended the cheddars and credda
 Instead of vendetta, a mellow beretta from ghetto to gutter
 Evidence? Nope! Never leave a shredda
 I got the soul of every rapper in me, love me and hate me
 My moms got raped by the industry and made me
 I'm the illest nigga ever, I told you
 I get more pussy than them dike bitches total
 Want beef, nigga? Psh better dead that ***
 My name should be "Can't-Believe-That-Nigga-Said-That-***"
 Probably say "he ain't a killa", but I'm killin' myself
 Smoke def, *** bitches raw, on the kitchen floor
 So think what I'm a do to you, have done to you
 Got niggas in my hood who'd do that *** for a bullet too
 What you want to do, cocksuckers? We're glockbusters
 'Til the cops cuff us, gonna start ruckus and drop blockbusters
 'Round the clock hustlers, you cannot touch us
 I'm gettin' wires niggas wantin' me dead
 Wantin' my head, you think it could be somethin' I said? Remember me? ("I just don't give a ***!")
 Remember me? ("Yeah, *** you too!")
 Remember me? ("I'm low down and I'm shifty!")
 Remember me? ("I'm shady!") When I go out, I'm a go out shootin'
 I don't mean when I die, I mean when I go out to the club, stupid
 I'm tryin' to clean up my ***in' image,
 So I promised the ***in' critics
 I wouldn't say "***in'" for six minutes
 (Six minutes, Slim Shady, you're on)
 My baby's mom, bitch made me an angry blond
 So I made me a song, killed her and put Haley on
 I may be wrong, I keep thinkin' these crazy thoughts
 In my cranium, but I'm stuck with a crazy mom
 (Is she really on as much dope as you say she's on?)
 Came home, and somebody must've broke in the back window
 And stole two loaded machine guns and both of my trench coats
 Sick sick dreams of picnic scenes, two kids, sixteen
 With M-16's with ten clips each
 And them ***s reach through six kids each
 And Slim gets blamed in Bill Clintin's speech to fix these streets?
 *** that! Psh you fagots can vanish to volcanic ash
 And re-appear in hell with a can of gas, and a match
 Aftermath, Dre, grab the gat, show 'em where it's at
 (Shot)
 (What the *** you starin' at, nigga?)
 Don't you remember me?
 Remember me?
 Remember me?!
 Remember me?!
