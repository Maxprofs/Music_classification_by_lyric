I Remember
I remember it well
The first time that I saw
Your head around the door
'Cause mine stopped working
I remember it well
There was wet in your hair
I was stood in stare
And time stopped moving
I want you here tonight
I want you here
'Cause I can't believe what I found
I want you here tonight want you here
Nothing is taking me down, down, down...
I remember it well
Taxied out of a storm
To watch you perform
And my ships were sailing
I remember it well
I was stood in your line
And your mouth, your mouth, your mouth...
I want you here tonight
I want you here
'Cause I can't believe what I found
I want you here tonight want you here
Nothing is taking me down, down, down...
Except you my love. Except you my love...
Come all ye lost
Dive into moss
And hope that my sanity covers the cost
To remove the stain of my love
In paper mache
Come all ye reborn
Blow off my horn
I'm driving real hard
This is love, this is porn
God will forgive me
But I, I whip myself in scorn, scorn
I wanna hear what you have to say about me
Hear if you're gonna live without me
I wanna hear what you want
I remember December
And I wanna hear what you have to say about me
Hear if you're gonna live without me
I wanna hear what you want
                        
                    |
