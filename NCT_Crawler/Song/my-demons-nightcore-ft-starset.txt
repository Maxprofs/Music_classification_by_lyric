                        Bài hát: My Demons - Nightcore, Starset

Mayday, mayday
The ship is slowly sinking
They think I'm crazy but they don't know the feeling
They're all around me , Circling like vultures
They want to break me
And 
Wash away my colors(x2)
Take me high and I'll sing
Oh,you make everything
OKAY, OKAY, OKAY
'KAY, OKAY, OKAY

We are one in the same
Oh, you take all of the pain
AWAY, AWAY, AWAY
WAY, AWAY , AWAY
Save me if I become my demons

I cannot stop this
Sickness taking over
It seeks control and
Drags me into no where
I need your help
I can't fight this forever
I know you're watching
I can feel you out there

Take me high and I'll sing
Oh,you make everything
OKAY, OKAY, OKAY
'KAY, OKAY, OKAY

We are one in the same
Oh, you take all of the pain
AWAY, AWAY, AWAY
WAY, AWAY , AWAY
Save me if I become my demons

Take me over
The walls below
Fly forever
Don't let me go
I need a savior
To heal my pain
Will I become my worst enemy? The enemy....

Take me high and I'll sing
You make everything okay
We are one the same
You take all of the pain away
                        
                    |
