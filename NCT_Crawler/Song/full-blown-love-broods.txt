                        Bài hát: Full Blown Love - Broods

Watching the world
Take on a new form
All that I knew then
Fades to oblivion
So sure that I
Had what I needed
I should've seen it
From the beginning

We drive into the night
Away from the life
Bringing us down
Oh
We try
Keeping it light
But we can't deny
We already know
Oh

This is full blown love
This is full blown love
This is full blown love

We greet the world
From under your shelter
Not even the morning
Could dull down the feeling
I fall into you
You're trying to prove
You meant every moment
I already know it

We drive into the night
Away from the life
Bringing us down
Oh
We try
Keeping it light
But we can't deny
We already know
Oh

This is full blown love
This is full blown love
This is full blown love

Away through the night
And into the dawn
Away from it all
It don't mean a thing to me anymore
Oh, maybe for us
Just one night of love
Was never enough
Cause I can't give up
No, I can't give up

We drive into the night
Away from the life
Bringing us down
Oh
We try
Keeping it light
But we can't deny
We already know
Oh

This is full blown love
This is full blown love
This is full blown love
This is full blown love
Away through the night
And into the dawn
We already know
This is full blown love
Away through the night
And into the dawn
We already know
This is full blown love
                        
                    |
