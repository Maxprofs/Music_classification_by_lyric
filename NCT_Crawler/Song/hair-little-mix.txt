                        Bài hát: Hair - Little Mix 

Switch it up 
Switch it up 
Oh whoa 
Yeah eh, Yeah 
Let's go 

I call my girl cause I got a problem 
Only a curl is gonna solve it 
Then I don't really care, 
just get him out of my hair, yeah 
Let's switch it up, get off my shoulder 
I've had enough, can't take it no longer 
I'm over him I swear, I'm like yeah 

Gotta get him out my hair 
Gotta get him out my hair 
Gotta get him out my hair 
Gotta get him out my hair 

Cause he was just a dick and I knew it 
Got me going mad sitting in this chair 
Like I don't care 
Gotta get him out my hair 
I tried everything but it's useless 
He pushed me so far now I'm on the edge 
Make him disappear 
Go get him out my hair 

Okay, gotta bleach him out, peroxide on him 
Hair on the floor like my memory of him 
Now I feel brand new, this chick is over you 
We're going out ain't got no worries 
Drama now, now it just seems so funny 
Put my hands up in the air, I'm like yeah 

Gotta get him out my hair 
Gotta get him out my hair 
Gotta get him out my hair 
Gotta get him out my hair 

Cause he was just a dick and I knew it 
Got me going mad sitting in this chair 
Like I don't care 
Gotta get him out my hair 
I tried everything but it's useless 
He pushed me so far now I'm on the edge 
Make him disappear 
Go get him out my hair 

Da-da-da-da-da da-da-da-da-da-da, 
switch it up, switch it up 
Da-da-da-da-da da-da-da-da-da-da, oh 
Da-da-da-da-da da-da-da-da-da-da, 
switch it up, switch it up 
Da-da-da-da-da da-da-da-da-da-da, oh 

When you need to get your phone, erase that number 
Don't call him back cause he don't deserve it 
And when you see him in the club 
Just flip your hair, don't show him any love 
Cause you've had enough 

Cause he was just a dick and I knew it 
Got me going mad sitting in this chair 
Like I don't care 
Gotta get him out my hair 
I tried everything but it's useless 
He pushed me so far now I'm on the edge 
Make him disappear 
Go get him out my hair 

Go get him out my hair 
He's in my hair 
Gonna get him out 
Gonna get him out 
(Got to get him out my hair)
