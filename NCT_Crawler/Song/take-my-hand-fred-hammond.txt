 Lord i stand before you once again
 im so glad that i know you understand

 and as usual i end up crying out to you
 i tried so hard to do my best
 but i dont feel like i'll make it through this test
 i cant remember feeling so much pain
 and my tears keep falling like the pooring rain
 i try to force myself to wear a smile but its just not there
 this pain im feeling deep inside my heart seems so unfare
 it really feels like i wont make it through another day
 so i stand before you with a broken heart and all i can say is
 precious Lord please
