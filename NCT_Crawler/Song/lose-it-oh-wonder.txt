                        Bài hát: Lose It - Oh Wonder

Downtown we let it go
Sunset high and our bodies low
Blood rush in the hazy glow
My hands, your bones
Loose up we break the scene
One step deep as you fall to me
Heart clap, we skip a beat
Count one, two, three
And don't you stop the music, get into it
Won't you dance with me?
Find a space and lose it, you can do it
Won't you dance with me?
Move your feet and feel it
In the space between
You gotta give yourself a moment
Let your body be
We gotta lose it
We gotta lose it
Lose it, lose it, lose it
We gotta lose it
Lose it, lose it, lose it
We gotta lose it
Your name I'll never know
As we get down in the world below
Caught up in an overflow
My hands, your bones
Wide eyed, you look at me
Set on fire in a silver dream
Spin round you can feel the breeze
Count one,...
