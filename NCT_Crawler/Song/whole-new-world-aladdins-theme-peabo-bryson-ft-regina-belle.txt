                        Bài hát: Whole New World (Aladdin'S Theme) - Peabo Bryson, Regina Belle

Aladdin:
I can show you the world
Shining, shimmering, splendid
Tell me, princess, now when did
You last let your heart decide?

I can open your eyes
Take you wonder by wonder
Over, sideways and under
On a magic carpet ride

A whole new world
A new fantastic point of view
No one to tell us no
Or where to go
Or say we're only dreaming

Jasmine:
A whole new world
A dazzling place I never knew
But when I'm way up here
It's crystal clear
That now I'm in a whole new world with you

Aladdin: Now I'm in a whole new world with you

Jasmine:
Unbelievable sights
Indescribable feeling
Soaring, tumbling, freewheeling
Through an endless diamond sky

A Whole New World (Aladdin: Don't you dare close your eyes)
A hundred thousand things to see (Aladdin: Hold your breath - it gets better)
I'm like a shooting star
I've come so far
I can't go back to where I used to be

Aladdin: A whole new world (Jasmine: Every turn a surprise)
With new horizons to pursue (Jasmine: Every moment red letter)

Aladdin and Jasmine:
I'll chase them anywhere
There's time to spare
Let me share this whole new world with you

Aladdin and Jasmine:
A whole new world (A whole new world)
That's where we'll be (That's where we'll be)
A thrilling chase
A wondrous place
For you and me
                        
                    |
