                        If I could write you a song to make you fall in love
I would already have you up under my arm
I used up all of my tricks, I hope that you like this
But you probably won't, you think you're cooler than me

You got designer shades just to hide your face and
You wear 'em around like you're cooler than me
And you never say "hey" or remember my name
And it's probably 'cause you think you're cooler than me

You got your high brow shoes on your feet
And you wear 'em around like it ain't *
But you don't know the way that you look
When your steps make that much noise

Shh, see I got you all figured out
You need every one's eyes just to feel seen
Behind your make up nobody knows who you even are
Who do you think that you are?

If I could write you a song to make you fall in love
I would already have you up under my arm
I used up all of my tricks, I hope that you like this
But you probably won't, you think you're cooler than me

You got designer shades just to hide your face and
You wear 'em around like you're cooler than me
And you never say "hey" or remember my name
And it's probably 'cause you think you're cooler than me

You got your high brow switch in your walk
And you don't even look when you pass by
But you don't know the way that you look
When your steps make that much noise

Shh, see I got you all figured out
You need every one's eyes just to feel seen
Behind your make up nobody knows who you even are
Who do you think that you are?

If I could write you a song to make you fall in love
I would already have you up under my arm
I used up all of my tricks, I hope that you like this
But you probably won't, you think you're cooler than me

You got designer shades just to hide your face and
You wear 'em around like you're cooler than me
And you never say "hey" or remember my name
And it's probably 'cause you think you're cooler than me

Now don't you dare act like you know don't know
Know what's up? 'Cause your nose is up
I'm approaching up, pshh, yup
Like I can't give you winter in the summer
A summer in the winter, Miami in December

Trying to look bored in them Diors, she probably is
Was acting shallow 'til she found out how deep that my pockets is
Mrs. pre-Madonna, this is your reminder
That I think you fine, but I'm finer

'Cause it sure seems
('Cause it sure seems)
You got no doubt
(That you got no doubt)
But we all see
(We all see)
You got your head in the clouds
(Clouds)

If I could write you a song to make you fall in love
I would already have you up under my arm
(Under my arm)
I used up all of my tricks, I hope that you like this
But you probably won't, you think you're cooler than me

You got designer shades just to hide your face and
You wear 'em around like you're cooler than me
And you never say "hey" or remember my name
And it's probably 'cause you think you're cooler than me
