                        Bài hát: Going Home - Libera

Going home, Going home
I am going home
Quiet like, some still day
I am going home

It's not far, just close by throught an open door
Work all done, care laid by never fear no more
Mother's there expecting me father's waiting too
Lots of faces gathered there all the friends I knew

...

I'm just going home

...

No more fear
No more pain
No more stumbling by the way no more longing for the day
Going to run no more

Morning star lights the way restless dreams all gone
Shadows gone, break of day real life has begun

There's no break, there' no end just living on
Wide awake, with a smile going on and on (going on and on)

Going home, Going home
I am going home
Shadows gone, break of day real life has begun
...
I'm just going home
...
