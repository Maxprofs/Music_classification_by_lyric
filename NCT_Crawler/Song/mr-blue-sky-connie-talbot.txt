                        Bài hát: Mr. Blue Sky - Connie Talbot

Sun is shinin' in the sky,
There ain't a cloud in sight
It's stopped rainin'
Everybody's in a play
And don't you know
It's a beautiful new day

Runnin' down the avenue
See how the sun shines brightly
In the city on the streets
Where once was pity
Mr. Blue Sky is living here today

[Chorus x2:]
Mr. Blue Sky, please tell us why
You had to hide away
For so long where did we go wrong

Hey you with the pretty face
Welcome to the human race
A celebration Mr. Blue Sky's
Up there waitin' and today
Is the day we've waited for

[Chorus x2]

Mr. Blue Sky [x3]

Mr. Blue you did it right
But soon comes Mr. Night
Creepin' over, now his
Hand is on your shoulder
Never mind I'll remember you this way

[Chorus]

Hey there Mr. Blue
We're so pleased to be with you
Look around see what you do
Everybody smiles at you

Hey there Mr. Blue
We're so pleased to be with you
Look around see what you do
Everybody smiles at you

Hey there Mr. Blue
We're so pleased to be with you
Look around see what you do
Mr. Blue Sky
                        
                    |
