                        You were so amused
 When I made myself available
 You had to ask if it was all intentional Well, something is going on, on and on
 Something is going on, going on and on
 I'm finding out all about you The sun is hiding and the car is running badly
 I know only one way a friend should kiss
 A friend goodbye But something is going on, on and on
 Something is going on, going on and on
 I'm finding out all about you You're taking it all to hard
 I've nothing left to fight you with
 All your pretty things are merely to create the myth That something is going on, on and on
 Something is going on, going on and on
 I'm finding out all about you Yeah, something is going on, on and on
 Something is going on, going on and on and
 I'm finding out all about you, yeah
 I'm finding out all about you
