Oh, won't you stay for a while?
I'II take you on a ride if you can keep a secret
Oh, won't you stay for a while?
Show me darkest, baby, show me your deepest
Oh, won't you stay for a while?
I'II take you on a ride if you can keep a secret
Oh, won't you stay for a while?
Show me darkest, baby, show me your deepest

(Oh, won't you stay for a while?)
(Oh, won't you stay for a while?)
(I'II take you on a ride if you can keep a secret)

(Oh, won't you stay for a while?)
(Oh, won't you stay for a while?)
(I'II take you on a ride if you can keep keep body)
Keep a secret

Stay a while, stay a while
And I will make worth your while
Worth your while
Stay a while, stay a while
And I'mma go to the extra mile, extra mile
Boy, if you wait until the lights go down
I got some tricks that help you scream it out
Stay a while, stay a while
And I'mma make it worth your while, worth your while
(Oh, won't you stay for a while?)

(Oh, won't you stay for a while?)
(I'II take you on a ride if you can keep a secret)
(Oh, won't you stay for a while?)
(I'II take you on a ride if you can keep keep body)
