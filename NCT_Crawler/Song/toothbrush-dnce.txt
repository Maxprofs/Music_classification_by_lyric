                        Bài hát: Toothbrush - DNCE

[Chorus 1]
Baby you don’t have to rush
You can leave a toothbrush
At my place
At my place
We don’t need to keep it hush
You can leave a toothbrush
At my place
At my place

[Verse 1]
Stuck in a limbo
Half hypnotized
Each time I let you stay the night, stay the night
Up in the morning
Tangled in sheets
We play the moment on repeat

[Pre-Chorus]
When you’re standing there in your underwear
And my t-shirt from the night before
With your messed up hair
And your feet still bare
Would you mind closing the bedroom door?

[Chorus 2]
Baby you don’t have to rush
You can leave a toothbrush
At my place
At my place
We don’t need to keep it hush
You can leave a toothbrush
At my place
At my place
Cause I just, I just can’t let you go
Give me something I never know
So baby you don’t have to rush
You can leave a toothbrush
At my place
At my place

[Verse 2]
No need to question next time we meet
I know you’re coming home with me, home with me
Sweat like a sauna
Break out the ice
I know you’re gonna stay the night, stay the night

[Pre-Chorus]
When you’re standing there in your underwear
And my t-shirt from the night before
With your messed up hair
And your feet still bare
Would you mind closing the bedroom door?

[Chorus 2]
Baby you don’t have to rush
You can leave a toothbrush
At my place
At my place
We don’t need to keep it hush
You can leave a toothbrush
At my place
At my place
Cause I just, I just can’t let you go
Give me something I never know
So baby you don’t have to rush
You can leave a toothbrush
At my place
At my place

[Bridge]
I don’t want this to end
And there’s no need to play pretend
If you stay with me again
Would you mind closing the bedroom door?

[Chorus 2]
Baby you don’t have to rush
You can leave a toothbrush
At my place
At my place
We don’t need to keep it hush
You can leave a toothbrush
At my place
At my place
Cause I just, I just can’t let you go
Give me something I never know
So baby you don’t have to rush
You can leave a toothbrush
At my place
At my place
                        
                    |
