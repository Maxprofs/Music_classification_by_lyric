                        SAYONARA -さよなら 

( GINA T ) 

She seems to be the light of the morning sun 
She is the only pearl of her family 
One day she fell in love but the rules are strong, so strong ... 
Don't love the strangers, no one lets go in here. 

And she says don't cry for me my love, sayonara ... 
Don't forget the nights of thousand breathes 
Don't forget the little Japanese, sayonara ... 
In my heart I keep on love in you 

Up in her eyes she show all the love and pain 
Japanese managed all that he had to go 
And sometimes in the night you can hear her cry, her cry ... 
So loneliness the life from sweet butterfly ... 

And she says don't cry for me my love, sayonara ... 
Don't forget the nights of thousands breathes 
Don't forget the little Japanese, sayonara ... 
In my heart I keep on love in you ...

Don't forget the little Japanese, sayonara ... 
In my heart I keep on love in you
