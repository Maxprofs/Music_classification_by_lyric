                        Evolution is a mystery
 Full of change the no one sees.
 What makes a fool of history .
 Yesterday is too long ago, don't agree with what I know .
 Tomorrow's not the place to be. I see the line in the sand
 Time to find out who I am
 Looking back to see where I stand. EVOLUTION EVOLUTION See my reflection change.
 Nothing ever stays the same
 But you know the name's the game.
 We all know what it means
 Nothings ever what it seems
 Unforgiven
 Unforseen I see the line in the sand
 Time to find out who I am
 Looking back to see where I stand. EVOLUTION EVOLUTION Take it I'm hopeful
