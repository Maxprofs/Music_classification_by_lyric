                        In the morning it comes, heaven sent a hurricane
 Not a trace of the sun but I don't even run from rain
 Beating out of my chest, heart is holding on to you
 From the moment I knew
 From the moment I knew

 You were the air in my breath filling up my love soaked lungs
 Such a beautiful mess intertwined and overrun
 Nothing better than this, ooh, and then the storm can come
 You feel just like the sun
 Just like the sun

 And if you say we'll be alright
 I'm gonna trust you, babe
 I'm gonna look in your eyes
 And if you say we'll be alright
 I'll follow you into the light

 Never mind what I knew, nothing seems to matter now
 Ooh, who I was without you, I can do without
 No one knows where it ends, how it may come tumbling down
 But I'm here with you now
 I'm with you now

 And if you say we'll be alright
 I'm gonna trust you, babe
 I'm gonna look in your eyes
 And if you say we'll be alright
 I'll follow you into the light

 Let the world come rush in
 Come down hard, come crushing
 All I need is right here beside me
 I'm not enough I swear it
 But take my love and wear it over your shoulder

 And if you say we'll be alright
 I'm gonna trust you, babe
 I'm gonna look in your eyes
 And if you say we'll be alright
 I'll follow you into the light
                        
                    |
