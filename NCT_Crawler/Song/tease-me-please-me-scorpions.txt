                        Been around the world
 Known a lot of girls
 Living and loving
 It's hard to keep them all in line
 Seen a lot of sights
 Many crazy nights
 Cruising and boozing
 It's a wonder that I'm still alive

 Never wasted any time
 Never missed a beat
 Total satisfaction
 Always guaranteed

 Tease me
 Please me
 No one needs to know, oh no
 Tease me
 Please me
 Before I have to go

 Come on

 Spread the world around
 Boys are back in town
 Reeling and rocking
 We're rolling with it win or lose
 Girls are dressed to kill
 Looking for a thrill
 Sliding and gliding
 Sometimes they make it hard to choose
 So hard to choose

 Never wasted any time
 Never missed a beat
 Total satisfaction
 Always guaranteed

 Tease me
 Please me
 No one needs to know, oh no
 Tease me
 Please me
 Before I have to go
 Tease me
 Please me
 We'll take it nice and slow
 Nice and slow
 Tease me
 Please me
 Just let the feeling grow
 Let it grow

 Never wasted any time
 Never missed a beat
 Total satisfaction
 Always guaranteed

 Tease me
 Please me
 No one needs to know, oh no
 Tease me
 Please me
 Before I have to go
 Tease me
 Please me
 We'll take it nice and slow
 Nice and slow
 Tease me
 Please me
 Just let the feeling grow
 Let it grow
