Singer: Duet With Jonas Brothers (Live) - Miley Cyrus, Jonas Brothers

Yeah-ah-ah
Whoa-oh-oh-oh

No this isn't what I wanted
Never thought it'd come this far
Thinkin' back to where we started
And how we lost all that we are
We were young and times were easy
But I could see it's not the same
Standing here but you don't see me
Give it all for that to change
I don't want to lose her
Don't want to let her go

Standing out in the rain
Need to know if it's over
Cause I would leave you alone
I'm flooded with all this pain
Knowing that I'll never hold her
Like I did before the storm
Yeah-ah-ah
Before the storm

With every strike of lightning
Comes a memory that lasts
Not a word is left unspoken
As the thunder starts to crash
Maybe I should give up

Standing out in the rain
Need to know if it's over
Cause I would leave you alone
I'm flooded with all this pain
Knowing that I'll never hold her
Like I did before the storm

I'm trying to keep the lights from going out
And the clouds from ripping out my broken heart
They always say a heart is not a home
Without the one who gets you through the storm

Standing out in the rain
Knowing that it's really over
Please don't leave me alone
I'm flooded with all this pain
Knowing that I'll never hold ya
Like I did before the storm
Yeah
Like I did before the storm
                        
                    |
