                        Bài hát: Walka Not A Talka - Lindsay Lohan, Mya, Snoop Dogg

JR and Lindsey

No problem breakin’ myself off
If that’s what keeps me focused, man, yeah
(Gotta get it, gotta get it)
Done had my share of silly heartbreaks
And now, now I’m a bitch that got a plan

See when I talk it I’mma walk it
Back it up and keep it rockin’
I’mma shake these haters off
Straight business start takin’ charge

When I’mma talk it I’mma walk it
Back it up and keep it rockin’
No one, don’t get involved
Gotta boss up, bitch, if you want it all

If you a walka not a talka
(G’s up, G’s up)
If you a walka not a talka
(Throw it up, throw it up)

To all my ladies in the spot
If you workin’ what you got
If you a walka not a talka
(G’s up, G’s up)

I’m not the type for many way
(I’m just a chill chick)
Less I got somethin’ good to say
(I am extravagant)
Straight in the hill, straight in the hood
(I’m always comfortable)
I’ll take a G and flip him three ways

See when I talk it I’mma walk it
Back it up and keep it rockin’
I’mma shake these haters off
Straight business start takin’ charge

See when I talk it I’mma walk it
Back it up and keep it rockin’ with you
Put the beat on pause
Be a real boss bitch start makin’ loud

If you a walka not a talka
(G’s up, G’s up)
If you a walka not a talka
(Throw it up, throw it up)

To all my ladies in the spot
If you workin’ what you got
If you a walka not a talka
(G’s up, G’s up)

And what more can I say
We rockin’ to set the pause
And I’m goin’ to shakes to all my
My underfavo’s to my CEO’s, I see ya
Just raise them glasses if you go for broke, ooh

I’m smokin’ all up in the club
I’m gettin’ what I want with the lendi in my cup
I want more than one, I’m all about the ball
I’m in it for a second, the moment, the minute

Today and tomorrow, I’m in it for the ball
And she is to see ’cause she’s all up in the doll
This is what I’m gon’ do, ball ’til I fall
Me and Mya in the back of the party

Gettin’ hugged by everybody, gettin’ higher
The ladies just love Snoop D O Dogg
They say I walk just like and my talk is like
Matter of fact I let a boss is like

If you a walka not a talka
(G’s up, G’s up)
If you a walka not a talka
(Throw it up, throw it up)

To all my ladies in the spot
If you workin’ what you got
If you a walka not a talka
(G’s up, G’s up)
