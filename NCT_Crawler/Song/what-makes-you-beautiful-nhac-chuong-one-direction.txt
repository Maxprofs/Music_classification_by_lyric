Baby you light up my world like nobody else
The way that you flip your hair gets me overwhelmed
But you when smile at the ground it aint hard to tell
You don't know
You don't know you're beautiful.

If only you saw what i can see
You'll understand why i want you so desperately
Right now i'm looking at you and i can't believe
You don't know
You don't know you're beautiful
Oh oh
But that's what makes you beautiful.
