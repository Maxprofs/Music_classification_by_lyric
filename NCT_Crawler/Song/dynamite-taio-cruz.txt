                        I came to dance dance dance dance
I hit the floor cuz that's my plans plans plans plans
I'm wearing all my favorite brands brands brands brands
Give me some space for both my hands hands hands hands
Cuz this goes on and on and on
and it goes on and on and on
I throw my hands up in the air somtimes
Saying heyy ohh
Gotta let go
I wanna celebrate and live my life
Saying heyy ohh
Baby lets go
Cuz we gon' rock this club
We gon' go all night
We gon' light it up
Like its dynamite
Cuz I told you once
Now i told you twice
We gon' light it up
Like its dynamite
I came to move move move move
Get out the way we have my crew crew crew crew
I'm in the club so I'm gonna do do do do
Just drop the phone

Cuz it goes on and on and on
And it goes on and on and on yeahhhh
I throw my hands up in the air sometimes
Saying heyy ohh
