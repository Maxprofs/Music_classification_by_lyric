                        Seconds hours so many days
You know what you want but how long can you wait
Every moment last forever if you feel you've lost your way
What if your chances are already gone
Started believing that I could be wrong
But you give me one good reason
to fight and never walk away
Coz hear I am still holding on!
Every step you climb another mountain
Every breathe its harder to believe
You'll make it through the pain
Weather the hurricanes
To get to that one thing
When you think the road is going nowhere
Just when you've almost gave up on your dreams
Then take it by the hand and show you that you can
There are no boundaries
There are no boundaries
I'm faulting my landing to stand on the edge
What if today is as good as again
Don't know what the future is heading
Nothing's gonna bring me down
I've jumped every bridge and I've heard every lie
I've risked being safe but I always knew why
I always knew why
So hear I am still holding on!
Every step you climb another mountain
Every breathe its harder to believe
You'll make it through the pain
Weather the hurricanes
To get to that one thing
When you think the road is going nowhere
Just when you've almost gave up on your dreams
Then take it by the hand and show you that you can
You can go higher
You can go deeper
There are no boundaries
Above and beneath you
Break every rule coz there's nothing between you and your dreams
Every step you climb another mountain
Every breathe its harder to believe, Yeah
There are no boundaries
There are no boundaries
Every step you climb another mountain
Every breathe its harder to believe
You'll make it through the pain
Weather the hurricanes
There are no boundaries [3x]
