                        song: One More Try - George Michael
I've had enough of danger and people on the streets
I'm looking out for angels, just trying to find some peace
I think it's time that you let me know
So if you love me, say you love me
But if you don't just let me go

'Cause teacher, there are things that I don't want to learn
And the last one I had made me cry
So I don't want to learn to hold you
Touch you, think that you're mine
Because it ain't no joy for an uptown boy
Whose teacher has told him goodbye, goodbye, goodbye

When you were just a stranger and I was at your feet
I didn't feel the danger, now I feel the heat
That look in your eyes, telling me no
So you think that you love me, know that you need me
I wrote the song, I know it's wrong, just let me go

And teacher, there are things that I don't want to learn
Oh the last one I had made me cry
So I don't want to learn to hold you
Touch you, think that you're mine
Because it ain't no joy for an uptown boy
Whose teacher has told him goodbye, goodbye, goodbye

So when you say that you need me
That you'll never leave me
I know you're wrong, you're not that strong
Let me go

And teacher, there are things that I still have to learn
But the one thing I have is my pride
Oh so I don't want to hold you
Touch you, think that you're mine
Because there ain't no joy for an uptown boy
Who just isn't willing to try

I'm so cold
Inside
Maybe just one more try
                        
                    |
