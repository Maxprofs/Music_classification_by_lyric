Ca sĩ: LMFAO

When I walk on by 
Girls be looking like damn he fly 
I pay to the beat 
Walking on the street with in my new lafreak yeah 
This is how I roll 
Animal print pants out control
It's real fool with the big F 
They like bruce lee rock at the club 
Girl look at that body
Girl look at that body
Girl look at that body 
I work out 
Girl look at that body 
Girl look at that body
Girl look at that body 
I work out 
When I walk in the spot
This is what I see 
Everybody stops and they staring at me 
I got passion in my pants and 
I ain't afraid to show it 
I'm sexy and I know it
I'm sexy and I know it
When I'm at the moss
Purity just can't fight them up 
When I'm at the beach
I'm in a speedo trying to tan my cheeks 
This is how I roll
Come on ladies it's time to go
We hit it to the bar 
Baby don't be nervous 
No shows no shirt and 
I still get serviced 
Girl look at that body
Girl look at that body
Girl look at that body 
I work out 
Girl look at that body
Girl look at that body
Girl look at that body
I work out 
When I walk in the spot
This is what I see 
Everybody stops and they staring at me 
I got passion in my pants and 
I ain't afraid to show it 
I'm sexy and I know it 
I'm sexy and I know it 
Girl look at that body 
Girl look at that body
Girl look at that body
I work out 
Girl look at that body
Girl look at that body
Girl look at that body
I work out
