Drake - Best I Ever Had

( Drake Talking )
You know a lot of girls be. . Thinking My songs are about them,
This is not to get confused
This ones for you.

( Chorus )
Baby you my everything
Youre all I ever wanted
We can do it real big
Bigger then you ever done it
You be up on everything
Other hoes ain't never on it
I want this forever I swear
I can spend whatever on it

Cause she hold me down every time I hit her up
When I get right I promise that we gon live it up
She make me beg for it till she give it up
And I say the same thing every single time

I say you the Fuckin best
you the fuckin best
you the fuckin best
you the fuckin best
you the best I Eva had
best I eva had
best I eva had
best I eva had
I said you the fuckin . . .

( Verse 1 )
Know you got a roommate
Call me when there's no one there
Put the key under the mat and
You know I'll be over there
Yup I'll be over there
Shawty I'll be over there
I'll be hitting all the spots that you aint even know was der
Ha and you don't even have to ask twice
You can have my heart or we can share it like the last slice
Always felt like you was so accustomed to the fast life
Have a nigga thinking that he met you in the past life
Sweat pants, hair tied, chillin with no makeup on
That's when youre the prettiest I hope that you don't take it wrong You dont even trip when friends say you aint bringin Drake along
You know that I'm workin I'll be there soon as I make it home
And she a patient in my waitin room
Never pay attention to the rumors and wat they assume
And until them girls prove it
I'm the one to never get confused with cause . . .

( Chorus)
Baby you my everything
Youre all I ever wanted
We can do it real big
Bigger then you ever done it
You be up on everything
Other hoes ain't never on it
I want this forever I swear
I can spend whatever on it

Cause she hold me down every time I hit her up
When I get right I promise that we gon live it up
She make me beg for it till she give it up
And I say the same thing every single time

I say you the Fuckin best
you the fuckin best
you the fuckin best
you the fuckin best
you the best I Eva had
best I eva had
best I Eva had
best I eva had
I said you the fuckin . . .

( Verse 2 )
Sex, Love, Pain
Baby I be on that tank ***
Buzz so big I could probably sell a blank disc
When my album drop bitches will buy it for the pictures
Niggas will buy it too and claim dey got it for they sista
Magazine paper girl the money ain't the issue
They bring dinner to my room ask me to initial
She call me the referee cause I be so official
My shirt aint got no stripes
But I can make ya pussy whiiiiiiiistle
Like The Andy Griffith theme song
And who told you to put them jeans on?
Double cup love you the one I lean On
Feelin' for a fix
Then you should really get ya pheen on
Yeah, just know my condo is the crack spot
Every single show she out there reppin' like a mascot
Get it from the back and make ya *** bra strap pop
All up in ya slot till a nigga hit the jackpot
sang

( Chorus )
Baby you my everything
Youre all I ever wanted
We can do it real big
Bigger then you ever done it
You be up on everything
Other hoes ain't never on it
I want this forever I swear
I can spend whatever on it

Cause she hold me down every time I hit her up
When I get right I promise that we gon live it up
She make me beg for it till she give it up
And I say the same thing every single time

I say you the Fuckin best
you the fuckin best
you the fuckin best
you the fuckin best
you the best I Eva had
best I eva had
best I Eva had
best I eva had
I said you the fuckin best
