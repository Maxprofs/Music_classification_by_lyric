                        Bài hát: All The Time - Jeremih

Early in the morning's when I think about you
I hit you like what you sayin'
And the morning when I wanna *** you
Yeah, I hit you like what you sayin'
I could *** you all the time
I could *** you all the time

M-O-E-T
That's what the *** we be sippin
That's what the *** be drippin
My Trap house still tippin
Face time while I'm gone
She gave me dome from the distance
She love to climb on top
But she love to walk off limping
Pimps up, hoes down
Legs up or toes down
Why she jock me, cause she knocked knee'd
And we got trees, so many go around
Gotta know I ate her
She so sweet now and later
I want that all the time, all the time
I know you all mine...

Early in the morning's when I think about you
I hit you like what you sayin'
In the morning when I wanna *** you
Yeah, I hit you like what you sayin'
I could *** you all the time
I could *** you all the time

Early in the morning's when I think about you
I hit you like what you sayin'
In the morning when I wanna *** you
Yeah, I hit you like what you sayin'
I could *** you all the time
I could *** you all the time
