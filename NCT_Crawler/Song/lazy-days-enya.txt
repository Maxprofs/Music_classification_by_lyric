Âu Mỹ khác|

                        Lazy old day
rolling away
dreaming the day away
don't want to go
now that I'm in the flow
crazy amazing day

One red balloon
floats to the moon
just let it fly away
I only know
that I'm longing to go
back to my lazy days

And how it sings and how it sighs
and how it never stays
And how it rings and how it cries
 and how it sails away... away... away...
                        
                    |
