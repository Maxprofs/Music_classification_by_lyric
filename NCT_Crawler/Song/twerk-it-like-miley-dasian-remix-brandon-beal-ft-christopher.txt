Hey, girl, this yo song, let's see that padonkadondon 
I'mma try to do the things that you don't 
Baby, it's yo party, I just wanna play 
What's that sound? What's that thang that's got me like wow? 
I'm tryna beat beat it up twelve rounds 
Girl, look at that body, I just gotta say 

When you back back back back back it up 
And you drop it down low 
And you pick pick pick pick pick it up 
Girl, I'm ready to blow 
I'ma stack stack stack stack stack it up 
And I'm spending it all 
When I throw throw throw throw it up 

(Chorus x6) 
Start twerk't like Miley 


You got everybody in this club looking at you girl 
How you move that thing from side to side 
*** everybody in this club, cause I got you girl 
I'mma tell you what's goin' down tonight 
Girl, it's gon' rain, that's that sound 
That's that *** that's got you like wow 
And would you let me beat beat twelve rounds 
Baby, look at that body, I just gotta say 

You back back back back back it up 
And you drop it down low 
And you pick pick pick pick pick it up 
Girl, I'm ready to blow 
I'ma stack stack stack stack stack it up 
And I'm spending it all 
When I throw throw throw throw it up 


Start twerk't like Miley 

I know you wore them jeans 
so I can see that thong thong thong thong thong 
thong thong thong thong thong 
pop it like Miley 
And don't forget that tongue tongue tongue tongue 
tongue tongue tongue tongue tongue tongue 

Twenty more shots then I pass out 
but that's what I'm aiming for 
Baby, let me drown 
when I wake up, I'm still in the club 
Looking at the DJ, like turn my *** up, oh 

So when the beat beat beat beat beat drops 
get your ass on the floor 
Start twerk it like Miley 
Start twerk it like Miley 
Start twerk it like Miley 
Start twerk it like Miley 
Right beside me 
GO
