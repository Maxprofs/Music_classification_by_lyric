                        Stay With Me Baby - Duffy

Where did you go, when things went wrong, baby 
Who did u run to; find a shoulder to lay your head upon 
Ooh wasn't I there, didn't I take good care of you 
Oh no can't believe, your leaving me 

Stay, Stay With Me Baby, 
Stay With Me Baby, 
Please Stay With Me Babe, 
I can't go on 

Where did you go, in search of tenderness? 
Didn't I give you everything in return for a memory? 
Ooh wasn't I there, baby I, maybe I was too good for you 
Oh no can't believe, your leaving me 

Stay, Stay With Me Baby, 
Stay With Me Baby, 
Please Stay With Me Babe, 
I can't go on 

Oh remember, you said you'd never leave me 
Oh remember, you said you would always need me 
Remember, Remember 
I'm asking you, begging you, begging you 

Ooh Stay with Me Babe, 
Please Stay With Me Baby, 
Oh please stay with me babe 
I just can't go on 
No stay, stay 
I'll stay, stay, so don't go 
Stay with me babe 
You know I Can't go on, can't go on 
Can't so, can't so stay please, stay
