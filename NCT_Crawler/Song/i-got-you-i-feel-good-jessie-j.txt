                        Bài hát: I Got You (I Feel Good) - Jessie J

[Chorus 1]
Wow, I feel good, I knew that I would now
I feel good, I knew that I would now, yes
So good, so good, so good, so good, so good
Said, I got you

[Chours 2]
Wow, I feel nice, like sugar and spice
I feel nice, baby, like sugar and spice
So nice, so nice, so nice, so nice, so nice
Said, I got you
Hey

[Bridge]
When I hold you in my arms
I know that I can do no wrong
And when I hold you in my arms
My love can't do me no harm

[Chorus 2]
And I feel nice, like sugar and spice (sugar, sugar, sugar, sugar, sugar and spice)
I feel, feel, feel nice (I feel nice, yeah)
Like sugar and spice (Woo, hey)
Du-du-du-du-du-du-du-du, du-du-du-du
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I said (Yeah!)

[Bridge]
When I hold you in my arms
I know that I can do no wrong
And when I hold you in my arms
My love can't do me no harm

[Chorus 2]
And I feel nice, like sugar, sugar and spice
I feel good, feel, feel, feel, feel good
I feel good
I'm looking good, damn, I'm looking good
Feel, feel, feel, feel, f-feel good

[Outro]
Jessie J
You better sing with me, let's go again
Ooh, ooh, ooh
