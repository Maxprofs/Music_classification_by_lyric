                        Some say I make the guys hypnotized
 When I bat my eyes and walk past
 They say I'm such a tease
 But that's just me, take it or leave it, baby Don't mean to impose boy, I'll let you know
 You're hearing me say yes, I'm sayin' no
 I'm not one of those girls you think that you know
 So you can talk that talk, listen Boys, boys, boys, they gimme, gimme, they gimme
 They follow my voice
 Boys, boys, they gimme, gimme, they gimme Some say that I always insinuate
 I can get my way, so true
 Because my kiss is like kryptonite
 I can make 'em weak, I'm so cruel Don't mean to impose boy, I'll let you know
 You're hearing me say yes, I'm sayin' no
 But you'll never get the best of me
 'Cuz I get what I want and I know what I need Boys, boys, boys, they gimme, gimme, they gimme
 They follow my voice
 Boys, boys, they gimme, gimme, they gimme Use your head but not that one
 One track mind, your one track mind, your one track mind
 Use your head but not that one
 One track mind, your one track mind, your one track mind Don't mean to impose boy, I'll let you know
 You're hearing me say yes, I'm sayin' no
 But you'll never get the best of me
 'Cuz' I get what I want and I know what I need Boys, boys, boys, they gimme, gimme, they gimme
 They follow my voice
 Boys, boys, they gimme, gimme, they gimme Boys, boys, boys, they gimme, gimme, they gimme
 They follow my voice
 Boys, boys, they gimme, gimme, they gimme Boys, boys
 Boys, boys
 Boys, boys
