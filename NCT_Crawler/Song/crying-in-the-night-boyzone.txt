                        Alone just sitting here
 Thinking of you 'til it hurts
 You're young so innocent
 Without a care in the world
 You're there, but not visible
 My expectations become
 Do you think it's right?
 And do you think it's right?
 Crying in the night
 For crying in the night
 (ooh in the night)
 My road was different
 There's so much that you have to learn
 A little hand in mine
 And all the smiles and laughter is fine
 Wherever I'll be, land or sea
 I will care for thee
 Do you think it's right?
 And do you think it's right?
 Crying in the night
 For crying in the night
 (ooh in the night)
 Each day provides its own gifts
 Time brings all to pass
 Writing comes more easily
 When you got something to say
 You're young, you're beautiful
 Have no enemy but time
 And in time, those who take time
 When time does last
 For time is no time
 When time is past
 Do you think it's right?
 And do you think it's right?
 Crying in the night
 Crying in the night
