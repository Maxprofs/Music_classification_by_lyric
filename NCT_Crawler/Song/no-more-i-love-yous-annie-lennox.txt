                        Song: No More "I Love You's" - Annie Lennox


 I used to be lunatic from the gracious days
 I used to be woebegone and so restless nights
 My aching heart would bleed for you to see
 Oh, but now
 (I don't find myself bouncing home whistling buttonhole just tuning me on) No more, I love you's
 The language is leaving me
 No more, I love you's
 Changes are shifting outside the word
 (The lover speaks about the monsters) I used to have demons in my room at night
 Desire, despair, desire, so many monsters
 Oh but now
 (I don't find myself bouncing home whistling buttonhole just tuning me on) No more, I love you's
 The language is leaving me
 No more, I love you's
 The language is leaving me in silence
 No more, I love you's
 Changes are shifting outside the word They were being really crazy
 They were on the come, and you know what mummy?
 Everybody was being really crazy
 Uh huh, the monsters are crazy, there are monsters outside No more, I love you's
 The language is leaving me
 No more, I love you's
 The language is leaving me in silence
 No more, I love you's
 Changes are shifting outside the word, outside the word No more, I love you's
 The language is leaving me
 No more, I love you's
 The language is leaving me
 No more, I love you's
 Changes are shifting outside the word, outside the word
