                        Too Soon To Say Goodbye Lyrics
Artist(Band):Gareth Gates

So many times
I’ve played around
Moving from one to another
I’ve been a fool
I’ve been unkind
But being with you makes me discover
That trust and honesty
Is all I really need
And I should really never let it slip away
’Cause girl

(Chorus)
Seeing you shine by the candlelight
Got me up and I felt so right
So good that baby I
I don’t want this night to be over
Still I’m here, please don’t leave
Let’s star in our own love scene
That you’re gonna spend the night
It’s too soon too say goodbye
It’s too soon too say goodbye

Darling I know
You’re the type that goes slow
And trust when I say I don’t mean to rush you
But give it some thought
If you’re all alone
You’re just gonna wish that I was there too

Imagine you and me
As close as two can be (oh)
We can let it flow for eternity

(Chorus)
Seeing you shine by the candlelight
Got me up and I felt so right
So good that baby I
I don’t want this night to be over
Still I’m here, please don’t leave
Let’s star in our own love scene
That you’re gonna spend the night
It’s too soon too say goodbye
It’s too soon too say goodbye


Darling I know
You’re the type that goes slow
And trust when I say
Trust when I say

(Chorus)
Seeing you shine by the candlelight
Got me up and I felt so right
So good that baby I
I don’t want this night to be over
Still I’m here, please don’t leave
Let’s star in our own love scene
That you’re gonna spend the night
It’s too soon too say goodbye
It’s too soon too say goodbye

Seeing you shine by the candlelight
Got me up and I felt so right
So good that baby I
I don’t want this night to be over
Still I’m here, please don’t leave
(Baby don’t leave me)
Let’s star in our own love scene
It’s too soon too say goodbye
                        
                    |
