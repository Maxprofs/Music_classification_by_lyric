                        Bài hát: What If - Johnny Orlando, Mackenzie Ziegler

[Verse 1: Johnny Orlando]
Let's talk about all the things that we shouldn't talk about
Those kind of words that will change all the things we talk about
Tell me do you ever think of us?
Should I ask for more or should I stop?

[Pre-Chorus: Johnny Orlando]
What if a tomorrow means that we are here together?
What if we are taking chances just to lose it all?
Am I really crazy thinking 'bout this all together?
What if I've been missing the writing on the wall?

[Chorus: Both]
What if I say
I know, you know
What if I told you I like you?
We stay, we go
What if I told you I like you?
I know, you know
What if I told you I like you?
We stay, we go
What if I told you I like you?
What if I told you I like you?
What if I told you I like you?

[Verse 2: Mackenzie Ziegler]
I hear everything they saying, saying 'bout us
It's not about right or wrong, it's about what we love
Would it be simple or would it be too complicated?
Should I keep going or maybe it's better to stop?

[Pre-Chorus: Mackenzie Ziegler]
What if a tomorrow means that we are here together? 
What if we are taking chances just to loose it all?
Am I really crazy thinking 'bout this all together?
What if I've been missing all the writing on the wall?

[Chorus: Both]
What if I say
I know, you know
What if I told you I like you?
We stay, we go
What if I told you I like you?
I know, you know
What if I told you I like you?
We stay, we go
What if I told you I like you?
What if I told you I like you?

[Bridge: Johnny Orlando, Mackenzie Ziegler, Both]
What if I say
I know, you know
What if I told you I like you?
We stay, we go
We stay, we go
What if I told you I like you?
I know, you know
What if I told you I like you?
We stay, we go
What if I told you I like you?
I like you
What if I told you I like you?
We stay, we go
What if I told you I like you?

[Outro: Johnny Orlando]
Let's talk about all the things we shouldn't talk about...
