Sia - Clap Your Hands

i’ve been the neglecting the good things
what i mean is i need the good things
i’m finding the light in the good things
i might need help to see the good things

shake me out of my misery, woah
make me
get out and wiggle it oh, oh, oh

clap your hands, clap your hands
turn the lights on my nights this is life
we only get one chance
clap your hands, clap your hands
come on dance, take a chance on romance
we only get one shot at love
clap your hands, clap your hands
turn the lights on my nights this is life
we only get one chance
clap your hands, clap your hands
come on dance, take a chance on romance
we only get one shot at love

i’m trying to fly in the good things
i’m finding this might be a good thing

shake me out of my misery, woah
make me
get out and wiggle it oh, oh, oh

clap your hands, clap your hands
turn the lights on my nights this is life
we only get one chance
clap your hands, clap your hands
come on dance, take a chance on romance
we only get one shot at love
clap your hands, clap your hands
turn the lights on my nights this is life
we only get one chance
clap your hands, clap your hands
come on dance, take a chance on romance
we only get one shot at love

clap your hands, clap your hands
turn the lights on my nights this is life
we only get one chance
clap your hands, clap your hands
come on dance, take a chance on romance
we only get one shot at love
clap your hands, clap your hands
turn the lights on my nights this is life
we only get one chance
clap your hands, clap your hands
come on dance, take a chance on romance
we only get one shot at love
