Brian McFadden--Room To Breathe
ukoo.net 
You think you know me think I give a damn
The boy who was foolish has made me a man
Is it wrong that I don't care that I don't want you anywhere
Near my face near my friends
Don't shed a tear when my life ends
Well I told you not to call me cause
I just can't stand your voice
And all it takes is your name mentioned
to ignite the fear of suffering
Don't even say you're sorry cause I know it's all a lie
Here's goodbye forever can't you give me just a little
Room to breathe
(can't you just leave it alone now)
Give me just a little room to breathe
(don't you think you've taken enough now)
Nothing you say now can change anything
I don't care how you feel I don't care what you mean
Save it all for someone else
You can drag them through you hell
For all I care and I don't
You killed me once wasn't that enough
Well I told you not to call me cause
I just can't stand your voice
And all it takes is your name mentioned
to ignite the fear of suffering
Don't even say you're sorry cause I know it's all a lie
Here's goodbye forever can't you give me just a little
Room to breathe
(can't you just leave it alone now)
Give me just a little room to breathe
(don't you think you've taken enough now)
Can't get far enough away
Can't get far enough away
Well I told you not to call me cause I
just can't stand your lies
I said goodbye forever can't you give me just a little
room to breathe
(can't you just leave it alone now)
Give me just a little room to breathe
(don't you think you've taken enough now)
Give me just a little room to breathe
Is it wrong that I don't care that I don't want you anywhere
