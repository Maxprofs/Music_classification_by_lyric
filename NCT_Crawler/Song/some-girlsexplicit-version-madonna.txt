                        Some girls can do anything
 Whole world hanging on a string
 She is flawless as fresh as she seems
 Some girls got an attitude
 They kiss without asking who

 Hot in the loop
 Some girls got a s*** look
 One drink and is all a blur
 Cash two is you wanna flirt

 Some girls going on the deep end
 Some girls living for the weekend
 Some girls I can get the freak on
 Some girls make a scene
 Shoot their mouths and talk a scene
 Crying in a limousine

 Some girls make you feel like a rocket hard as steel
 Some girls only ever like to see

 Some like to be me I am everything you wanna be
 I got you baby please
 I got you baby please

 Some girls wanna call the shots
 Some girls wanna be on top

 Some girls have a filthy mouth
 All talk and they never stop
 Just take it it's not enough

 Some girls make a scene
 Shoot their mouths and talk a scene
 Crying in a limousine
 Some girls make you feel like a rocket hard to steel
 Some girls only ever like the scenes

 Some girls are not like me I am everything you ever dreamed of
 I got you bagging baby please
 I got you bagging baby please

 Wrap your arms around my neck it's time to steel some hugs today
 If you wanna play this game with me
 I am not like all the rest
 Some girls are second best
 Put your loving to the test, you'll see

 Some girls are not like me
 I never wanna be like some girls
 Some girls are just for free
 I never wanna be like some girls

 Some girls are not like me I am everything you ever dreamed of
 I got you bagging baby please
 I got you bagging baby please
 Some girls are not like me I am everything you ever dreamed of
 I got you bagging on your knees
 I got you bagging baby please

 Some girls are not like me I never wanna be like some girls
 Some girls are just for free
 I never wanna be like some girls
