                        I never meant to be the one who kept you from the dark
But now I know my wounds are sewn because of who you are
I will take this burden on and become the holy one
But remember I am human and I’m bound to sing this song

So hear my voice remind you not to bleed
I’m here...

A savior will be there when you are feeling alone, oh
Savior for all that you do
Some live freely without their home

So here I write my lullaby to all the lonely ones
Remember as you learn to try to be the one you love
So I can take this pen and teach you how to live
But what is left unsaid is the greatest gift I give

So hear my voice remind you not to bleed
I’m here...

A savior will be there when you are feeling alone, oh
Savior for all that you do
Some live freely without their home

A savior will be there when you are feeling alone, oh
Savior for all that you do
Some live freely without their home

When I hear your cries praying for light
I will be there
When I hear your cries praying for light
I will be there
                        
                    |
