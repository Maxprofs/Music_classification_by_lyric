                        [drake]
It may not mean nothin to yall
but understand nothin was done for me
so i dont plan on stoppin at all
i want this * forever mayne

im shuttin * down in the mall
and tellin every girl she the one for me
and i aint even plannin to call
i want this * forever mayne

[drake]
last name ever, first name greatest
like a sprained ankle boy i aint nothing to play with
started off local , but thanks to all the haters
i know g4 pilots on a first name basis
in your city faded off the brown
nino
she insists she got more class
we know
swimmin’ in the money come and find me
nemo
if i was at the club you know i bald
kimo
dropped a mixtape that * sounded like an album
who’d a thought a country-wide tour would be the outcome
labels want my name beside an x like malcolm
everybody got a deal, i did it without one
yeah, nigga im about my business
killing all these rappers you would swear i had a hit list
everyone who doubted me is asking for forgiveness
if you ain’t been apart of it at least you got to witness
bitches....

[chorus]

[kanye]
i used to have hood dreams
big fame, big chains
i stuck my dick inside this life until that bitch came
i went hard all fall like the ball teams
just so i could make it rain, all spring
y’all seen my story, my glory
i had raped the game young you could call it statutory
when a nigga blow up they gon’ build statues for me
old money benjamin button whaat?! nuttin
now superbad chicks giving me mcLovin
you would think I ran the world like michelle’s husband
you would think these niggas would know me when they really doesn’t
like they was down with the old me no you *ing wasn’t
you’re such a *ing loser
he didn’t even go to class bueller
trade the grammy plaques just to have my granny back
remember she had that bad hip like a fanny pack
chasing that stardom would turn you into a maniac
all the way in hollywood and I can’t even act
they pull their cameras out and god damn they snap
i used to want this thing forever you can have it back.

[Chorus]

[lil wayne]
ok, hello its da martian,
space jam jordan’s,
i want this * forever, wake up and smell the garden
fresher than the harvest
step up to the target
if i had one guess than i guess im just new orleans
and i will never stop like i’m running from the cops
hop up in my car and told my chauffeur to the top
life is like a *ing roller coaster then it drops
but what should I scream for this is my theme park
my minds shine even when my thoughts seem dark
pistol on my side you don’t wanna hear that thing talk
let the king talk check the price and pay attention
lil wayne that’s what they got to say or mention
im like nevada in the middle of the summer,
i’m resting in the lead I need a pillow and a cover
shhh, my foots sleeping on the gas
no brake pads no such thing as last.

[Chorus]

[eminem]
there they go, back in stadiums
as shady spits his flow
nuts they go, macadamia they go so balistic whoa,
we can make them look like boso’s,
he’s wondering if he should spit this slow,
 * no go for broke,
his cup just runneth over oh no
he aint had a buzz like this since the last time he overdosed
they’ve been waiting patiently for pinocchio to poke his nose
back into the game and they know
rap will never be the same as before
bashing in the brains of these hoes
and establishing a name as he goes
the passion and the flame is ignited
you can’t put it out once we light it
this * is exactly what the * i’m talking about when we riot
you dealin with a few true villians
whose staying
                        
                    |
