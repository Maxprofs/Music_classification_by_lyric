                        Bài hát: Avenue - H.E.R.

[Verse 1]
I liked you better on the first date
I shoulda said what's wrong in the first place
I don't 'cause you always takin' it the wrong way
You won't listen you're too busy playin' 2K
I always been down but you still sleep
And even though I said that night I shouldn't been peaked
I feel it in my soul yeah it's so deep
So deep you should know that about me

[Chorus]
I just turned just turned down your avenue
I had to but I'm mad at you
You always say I got a attitude
But that's you, you was actin' rude
I had to ask you if you had a few
Because you always say I got a attitude

[Verse 2]
Why you talkin' to me like, you be like
Why you always wanna be right?
Oh I just need the time that you can't find
I just need to know that it's still mine
And the way that you can't say my name don't seem right
But I know when to go and to stop at the green light

[Chorus]
I just turned, just turned down your avenue
I had to but I'm mad at you
You always say I got a attitude
But that's you, you was actin' rude
I had to ask you if you had a few
Because you always say I got a attitude

[Bridge]
So I'm the one that's out of place
I'm the one that's in a way
I don't communicate
I'm so spoiled
So I'm the one that need a break
Like you ain't stay in my place
But you're the one who came home late
And I ain't loyal
That's you yeah that's you yeah that's you

[Chorus]
I just turned, just turned down your avenue
I had to but I'm mad at you
You always say I got a attitude
But that's you, you was actin' rude
I had to ask you if you had a few
Because you always say I got a attitude
                        
                    |
