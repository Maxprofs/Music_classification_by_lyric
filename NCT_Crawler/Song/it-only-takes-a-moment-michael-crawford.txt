                        It only takes a moment 
For your eyes to meet and then 
Your heart knows in a moment 
You will never be alone again 
I held her for an instant 
But my arms felt sure and strong 
It only takes a moment 
To be loved a whole life long... 
I missed a few words back there, Mr Jackl. Right after 'it only'-- 

...Takes a moment! 
For your eyes to meet and then 
Your heart knows in a moment 
You will never be alone again 
He held her for an instant 
But his arms felt sure and strong 
It only takes a moment- 
He held me for an instant 
But his arms felt safe and strong 
It only takes a moment 
To be loved a whole life long 
And that is all 
That love's about 

And we'll recall when time runs out 
That it only took a moment 
To be loved a whole life long!
