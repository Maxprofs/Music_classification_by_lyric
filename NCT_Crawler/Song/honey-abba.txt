                        Honey honey, how you thrill me, ah-hah, honey honey
Honey honey, nearly kill me, ah-hah, honey honey
Id heard about you before
I wanted to know some more
And now I know what they mean, youre a love machine
Oh, you make me dizzy

Honey honey, let me feel it, ah-hah, honey honey
Honey honey, dont conceal it, ah-hah, honey honey
The way that you kiss goodnight
(the way that you kiss me goodnight)
The way that you hold me tight
(the way that youre holding me tight)
I feel like I wanna sing when you do your thing

I dont wanna hurt you, baby, I dont wanna see you cry
So stay on the ground, girl, you better not get too high
But Im gonna stick to you, boy, youll never get rid of me
Theres no other place in this world where I rather would be

Honey honey, touch me, baby, ah-hah, honey honey
Honey honey, hold me, baby, ah-hah, honey honey
You look like a movie star
(you look like a movie star)
But I know just who you are
(I know just who you are)
And, honey, to say the least, youre a dog-gone beast

So stay on the ground, girl, you better not get too high
Theres no other place in this world where I rather would be

Honey honey, how you thrill me, ah-hah, honey honey
Honey honey, nearly kill me, ah-hah, honey honey
I heard about you before
I wanted to know some more
And now I know what they mean, youre a love machine
