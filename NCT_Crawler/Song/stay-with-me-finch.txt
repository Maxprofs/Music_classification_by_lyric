                        Once again your eyes make it hard to say goodbye
 So I'll just keep driving
 Where do you wanna go?
 It doesn't really matter as long as you are here with me
 With me, with me Whoa, there's something in the air tonight
 Something that makes me feel alive and I say
 Whoa, what were the words that you said to me
 That made me feel so special now? Once again your eyes make it hard to ask you why
 So I sit here knuckles tight
 Hands against the wheel
 Your head against the glass and you mean so much to me
 To me, to me Whoa, there's something in the air tonight
 Something that makes me feel alive and I say
 Whoa, what were the words that you said to me
 That made me feel so special ? Whoa
 Whoa
 Whoa
 Whoa Stay with me
 Cigarettes and open air, hand in hand
 And I said, "Stay with me
 'Coz every star that I see is brighter than the last" So stay with me
 Cigarettes and open air, hand in hand
 And I said, "Stay with me
 'Coz every star that I see is brighter than the last" So stay with me
 Cigarettes and open air, hand in hand
 And I said, "Stay with me
 'Coz every star that I see is brighter than the last"
 So stay with me
