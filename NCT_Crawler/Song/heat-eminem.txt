[Intro]
Wanna take it from the top?

[Verse 1]
Lady, you remind me of my raps on that Relapse ***
'Cause you got an ass thick as them accents
Two asscheek implants, call that an asset
'Cause you could set a glass on it, it's massive
From the first time I saw you, I actually said to myself
"I gotta meet her like a taxi"
Exactly, love affair in the backseat
Sorry if I'm being graphic, but I'm stiff as a statue
You sat on a shelf, I feel like I'm a bust
Maybe I'm just ahead of myself
Let me slow down, slow your Camaro
I'm tryna catch up, I'm tryna jump your bones to the marrow
Got me under your control and your spell
Wanna wrap you up, put you in a bow like an arrow
Grab you by the (meow!), hope it's not a problem, in fact
About the only thing I agree on with Donald is that
So when I put this palm on your cat
Don't snap, it's supposed to be grabbed
Why do you think they call it a snatch?
I just wanna climb in the sack
I'mma keep it a hundred, like my speedometer's at
I'm watching you rap, I'm the dude following back
About six cars back, I'm in the 'lac
And I want to (uh)

[Pre-Chorus]
All day, all day, all night
You ask, I stay the night
With you, you say you're fire
Me too, you're burning up
I'm running—

[Chorus]
All day, all night
You feel, my heat (fire)
Feel, feel, feel, feel, feel, my heat

[Verse 2]
Hate to inconvenience you at the convenience store
But them jeans you wore, like I've never seen before
I pretend I work there, while I clean the floor
Checking you out, like the clerk, while he rings you up
Pull up behind you, when you're leaving
And you don't even know it (ayo, Rick, man)
She's brushing her hair, adjusting her mirror
She's rapping my ***, but she wasn't aware
I was there, or maybe she was and just didn't care
Who knows? At least that ain't up in the air
It's something to see
But just like a girl who thinks her coochie doesn't stink
If she ain't planning to do ***, this summer's eve
Maybe she wants to keep me company
But *** the Pepé Le Pew ***
"Ain't stepping to you bitch," I say to myself
Plus she's bumping my music, ain't chasing no tail
Like a skunk in heat
I could sweat her, to some degree
But *** it, I'm the male, let her come to me
Let her come to me, male sweater, some degree, fail
*** it, pull up beside her
Sideswipe her, Dodge Vipe-her
What is a [?]
Asked if she wants a computer lodged in her vagina
Said my dick is an apple
She said, "put it inside her"
I said—

[Pre-Chorus]
All day, all day, all night
You ask, I stay the night
With you, you say you're fire
Me too, you're burning up
I'm running—

[Chorus]
All day, all night
You feel, my heat (fire)
Feel, feel, feel, feel, feel, my heat

[Verse 3]
Black out, come to, hands covered in blood
Mother***ing gloves and a shovel stuck in the mud
I just bodied the beat, so that hoe must've been dug
'Cause it just died like "ooh, food coloring, duh!"
So let's get turnt, like a shish kebab, twist it, Ma
Like an air-conditioning knob
We be great together
Don't care if it takes forever
If I gotta wait, I guess it's better late than never
You felt my heat, rubbing off on you
I love your personality
Come on, little mama, you're hot enough to melt Rick's beat
Come jump in the water, I bet you get your self esteem
From your persona
With an ass to match, girl, your body is lit
You're striking, I'm a gas
Girl, you're just gonna have to put the mother chumps on the back burner
You got buns, I got Asperger's
Just let me rest my head in between that set of Ds
While I shred MCs like cheddar cheese
That's just the thoroughbred in me, ain't a better breed
My dog thinks so, too, look at my pedigree
Ma, the world is what I think of you
I think you're divine, so I might swing on you
I'm just kidding girl, I wouldn't lift a finger or two
Unless it's the middle one, to finger you

[Pre-Chorus]
All day, all day, all night
You ask, I stay the night
With you, you say you're fire
Me too, you're burning up
I'm running—

[Hook]
Feel, feel, feel, feel, feel, my heat

[Outro: Eminem & Mark Walburg]
On the ones and twos, threes and four in (the morning)
Rick's in the cut like Neosporin (what?)
He's mixing it up for me and Lauren
A teddy like short for Theodore
We're outtie, five thousand
Who the ***? It's my big dick
So everybody get ready right-***ing-now
                        
                    |
