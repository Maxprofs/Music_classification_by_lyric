                        Oh, It's Now Or Never-It's No Empty Way
I Will Stay Forever-Babe, What Can I Say?
I Miss You Like Crazy-Where Did You Sleep Last Night?
Nobody Knows You Baby-Please Stay Here By My Side.

Chorus:
And All I Have And All I Need And All I Want Is You Tonight
And All I See And All I Feel Is Just Holding You So Tight
All I Miss And All I Dream And All I Want Is Your Sweet Love
And All I Know And All I Say Is That I Can't Get Enough

My Love Is Getting Stronger-My Love Is Here To Stay
I Can't Wait No Longer-Baby, Make My Day
Oh, Tonight I'm Lonely-So Lonely Without you
Know That You The Only And That My Heart Is True

All I Missed, It's You
Wherever I Go-I Miss You
And I Need You
                        
                    |
