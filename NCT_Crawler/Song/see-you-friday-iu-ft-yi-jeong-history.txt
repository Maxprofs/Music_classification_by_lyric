Wollyoiren ama bappeuji anheulkka
Hwayoildo seonggeuphae boiji an geurae
Suyoireun mwonga eojeongjjeonghan neukkim
Mogyoireun geunyang naega waenji sirheo
U~ ibeon ju geumyoil
U~ geumyoire sigan eottaeyo

Jumalkkaji gidarigin himdeureo
Sigana dallyeora sigyereul deo bochaego sipjiman (mind control)

Ilbun ilchoga dalkomhae
I namja dodaeche mwoya
Sarange ppajiji ankon mot baegigesseo
On jongil nae mameun jeogi sigyebaneul wie ollata
Han kanssik geudaeege deo gakkai

U~ ibeon ju geumyoil
U~ geumyoire sigan eottaeyo
Ttakhi bogo sipeun yeonghwaneun eobtjiman
Ttakhi meokgo sipeun menyuneun eobtjiman

Jumalkkaji gidarigin himdeureo
Sigana dallyeora sigyereul deo bochaego sipjiman (mind control)

Ilbun ilchoga dalkomhae
I namja dodaeche mwoya
Sarange ppajiji ankon mot baegigesseo
On jongil nae mameun jeogi sigyebaneul wie ollata
Han kanssik geudaeege deo gakkai

Na mwongae hollin geot gata
I yeojan dodaeche mwoya
Saranghaejuji ankoneun mot baegigesseo
Doraoneun ibeon ju geumyoire mannayo
Geu nal nae mameul deo gajyeogajwoyo

Deo gakkai deo gakkai wayo deo gakkai

Translation lyrics

You might be busy on monday
Tuesday might seem a bit hasty, no?
Wednesday seems to be a little be weird
I just don't like thursday
This friday~ how is it this friday?
I can't wait until this weekend
I want to tell the clock to run faster (mind control)
Every minute and second is sweet
What is this man
I can't stop falling in love
During all day, my heart is on those hands of the clock
One stop at a time closer to you
This friday~ how is it this friday?
There isn't a movie i want to see
There isn't a menu i would like
I can't wait until this weekend
I want to tell the clock to run faster (mind control)
Every minute and second is sweet
What is this man
I can't stop falling in love
During all day, my heart is on those hands of the clock
One stop at a time closer to you
I think i'm possessed by something
What is this girl
I can't stop falling in love
I'll see you this friday please take my heart that day
Come closer, closer closer
