                        Bài hát: Dilemma - Nelly, Kelly Rowland

I love you and I need you
Nelly, I love you, I do,
Need you

No matter what I do....
All I think about is you
Even when I’m with my Boo
Boy, you know I’m crazy over you

No matter what I do
All I think about is you
Even when I’m with my Boo
You know I’m crazy over you

(Nelly)
Uh-uh-uh-uh
I met this chick and she just moved right up the block from me
And she got the hots for me, the finest thing my hood did see
But oh, no, no, she got a man and a son oh-oh, but that’s okay
‘Cos I wait for my cue and just listen, play my position
Like a shortstop, pick up e’rything mami hittin’
And in no time I better make this lil hun mine and that’s pho sho
‘Cos I-I never been the type to break up a happy home
But uh there’s something ‘bout baby girl, I just can’t leave her ‘lone
So tell me, ma, what’s it gonna be
She said, “You don’t know what you mean to me,”

No matter what I do
All I think about is you
Even when I’m with my Boo
Boy, you know I’m crazy over you

No matter what I do
All I think about is you
Even when I’m with my Boo
You know I’m crazy over you

Uh-uh-uh-uh
I see a lot in your look and I never say a word
I know how niggas start actin’ trippin’ , and hate up all the girls
And there’s no way Nelly go for it
Ain’t fightin ova no dame, as you could see
But I like your steeze, your style, your whole demeanor
The way you come through and holler, and swoop me in his two-seater
Now that’s gangsta and I got special ways to thank ya,
don’t you forget it
But uh it ain’t that easy for you to back up and leave him
But uh you and me we got ties for different reasons
I respect that and right before I turned to leave
She said, “You don’t know what you mean to me,” come on

No matter what I do
All I think about is you
Even when I’m with my Boo
Boy, you know I’m crazy over you

No matter what I do
All I think about is you
Even when I’m with my Boo
You know I’m crazy over you

Sing it for me, Kelly

I love you and I need you
Nelly, I love you, I do
And it’s more than you’ll ever know
Boy, it’s pho sho
You can always count on my love
Forever more, yeah, yeah

West coast, I know you’re walkin’ right

No matter what I do
All I think about is you
Even when I’m with my Boo

No matter what I do
All I think about is you

You know I’m crazy over you
