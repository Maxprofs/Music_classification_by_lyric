                        Song: Perhaps Perhaps Perhaps - The Pussycat Dolls

You won't admit you love me
And so, how am I ever to know
You only tell me
Perhaps perhaps perhaps
A million times I ask you, and then
I ask you over again
You only answer
Perhaps perhaps perhaps

If you can't make your mind up
We'll never get started
And I don't want to wind up
Being parted, broken hearted
So if you really love me, say yes
But if you don't dear, confess
And please don't tell me
Perhaps perhaps perhaps
                        
                    |
