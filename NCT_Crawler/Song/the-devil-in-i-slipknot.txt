                        Bài hát: The Devil In I - Slipknot

 Undo these CHAINS, my friend
I'll show you THE RAGE I've hidden
Perish the Sacrament,
Swallow, but nothing's forgiven!
You & I can't decide which of us was taken for granted
Make amends, some of us are destined to be OUTLIVED!

STEP INSIDE,
SEE THE DEVIL IN I
Too many times, we've let it come to this
STEP INSIDE,
SEE THE DEVIL IN I
You'll realize I'm not YOUR DEVIL anymore

Under the words of men, something is tempting the father
Where is your will, my friend? Insatiates never even bother
You & I wrong or right, traded a lie for the leverage
In between the lens in light,
You're not what you seem!

STEP INSIDE,
SEE THE DEVIL IN I
Too many times, we've let it come to this
STEP INSIDE,
SEE THE DEVIL IN I
You'll realize I'm not your devil,
I'm not YOUR DEVIL anymore!

Your station is abandoned
Fool you 'cause I know what you've done!
Sensation,
Depravation
You should've burned
When you turned on everyone

SO STEP INSIDE,
SEE THE DEVIL IN I
Too many times, we've let it come to this
STEP INSIDE,
SEE THE DEVIL IN I
Oh, when all that's left does not make sense
STEP INSIDE,
SEE THE DEVIL IN I
I know you'll find your answers in the end
STEP INSIDE,
SEE THE DEVIL IN I
You'll realize I'm not YOUR DEVIL ANYMORE

SO STEP INSIDE,
STEP INSIDE
SEE THE DEVIL IN I
SEE THE DEVIL IN I
