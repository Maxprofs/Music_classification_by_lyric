                        Bài hát: Ugly - Jaira Burns

[Verse 1] 
(Mistah)
Sitting in the corner sipping on his gin 
(Mistah) 
Must be my good karma, it brought me next to him 
(Mistah) 
He said he like the color when he look in my eye 
(Mistah)
 His lips are like nirvana, his kiss is paradise  

[Pre-Chorus] 
He like to role play and talk dirty, keep me up 'til four thirty
 Play Marco Polo, feeling 'round with his eyes closed
 Call me Cleopatra, make me watch in the mirror 
Don't wanna say, "told you so"  

[Chorus]
 But, ah ah ah, ah ah ah 
As long as you love me, this could get ugly 
Ah ah ah, ah ah ah 
Yeah, baby, trust me, this could get ugly, protect me 
It's *** good, real *** good
 It's *** good, loving me like you should
 Ah ah ah, ah ah ah 
Yeah, baby, trust me, this could get ugly 

[Verse 2]
(Mistah)
Honeymoon is over, roses on the floor
(Mistah)
Screaming and accusing, calling me a ***
(Mistah)
Your words are shaking me, giving me whiplash
(Mistah)
We're on a trampoline and soon we're gonna crash

[Chorus]
But, ah ah ah, ah ah ah
As long as you love me, this could get ugly
Ah ah ah, ah ah ah
Yeah, baby, trust me, this could get ugly, protect me
It's *** good, real *** good
It's *** good, loving me like you should
Ah ah ah, ah ah ah
Yeah, baby, trust me, this could get ugly

[Chorus]
But, ah ah ah, ah ah ah
As long as you love me, this could get ugly
Ah ah ah, ah ah ah
Yeah, baby, trust me, this could get ugly, protect me
It's *** good, real *** good
It's *** good, loving me like you should
Ah ah ah, ah ah ah
Yeah, baby, trust me, this could get ugly
