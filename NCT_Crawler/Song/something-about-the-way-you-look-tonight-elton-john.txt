                        There was a time I was everything and nothing all in one
When you found me I was feeling like a cloud across the sun
I need to tell you how you light up every second of the day
But in the moonlight you just shine like a beacon on the bay

And I can't explain but it's something about the way you look tonight
Takes my breath away it's that feeling I get about you, deep inside
And I can't describe but it's something about the way you look tonight
Takes my breath away the way you look tonight

With you smile, you pull the deepest secrets from my heart
In all honesty I'm speechless and I don't know where to start

And I can't explain but it's something about the way you look tonight
Takes my breath away it's that feeling I get about you, deep inside
And I can't describe but it's something about the way you look tonight
Takes my breath away the way you look tonight

And I can't explain but it's something about the way you look tonight
Oh takes my breath away it's that feeling I get about you, deep inside
And I can't describe but it's something about the way you look tonight
Takes my breath away the way you look tonight

The way you look tonight
The way you look tonight
The way you look tonight
