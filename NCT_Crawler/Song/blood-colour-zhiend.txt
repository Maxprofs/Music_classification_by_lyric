                        Bài hát: Blood Colour - ZHIEND

Lying before me, scene painted in green
I was never found when I played hide & seek
The scenery I see is beautiful like my blood
Flows gracefully from my wrist that I've cut

Oh raging wind, go do your thing
And take me away out of this painted space
The world that I have yet to see
Where two of us are only

Shooting on my neck, the burning sun
Where is the day when I was never found?

I always fail to notice the important things in this life

Is it because I was playing foul?

The wound on my wrist I've cut myself
still has not been healed, tingles with pain
I shall tell my blood to soar up high with the wind
Let it dye everything

Oh raging wind, go do your thing
And take me away out of this tainted space
Have no complaints where I will be
even if it is more gray than where I am now

Riding the wind that rages high up in the air
I'm going to find you now
The world that I have yet to see
The world that only I exist
                        
                    |
