Can you be my doctor?
Can you fix me up?
Can you wipe me down?
So I can lick you up
Make you give it up, Give it up
Til you say my name
Like a jersey, jersey
Sh-ttin’ down the game
Be my head coach
So you can put me in
And never take me off
Til you can taste the win
Do it again and again
Til you say my name
And by the way I’m so glad that you came


Tell me baby are you wet
I’m gonna get you wet
Tell tell me baby are you wet
I just wanna get you wet wet


Tell me baby are you wet
I’m gonna get you wet
Tell tell me baby are you wet
I just wanna get you wet wet


Can you, can you get me up?
Like I’m wait for the first class
So I can give it to you rough
Like a first draft
Would you like a paper plane
You know ’bout that paper babe
But f-ck them dollar bills
Girl make it rain
holiday Inn, come
Meet me on the 8th floor
Damn it feels good but I feel bad for them maids though
But when I slip inside I turn girls into slip n slide


Tell me baby are you wet
I’m gonna get you wet
Tell tell me baby are you wet
I just wanna get you wet wet


Tell me baby are you wet
I’m gonna get you wet
Tell tell me baby are you wet
I just wanna get you wet wet


Where you going
What’d you say
I want her river flowing to another lake
Another ocean another ocean
On the beach on the beach
Let let me dip my feet and get wet


Tell me baby are you wet
I’m gonna get you wet
Tell tell me baby are you wet
I just wanna get you wet wet


Tell me baby are you wet
I’m gonna get you wet
Tell tell me baby are you wet
I just wanna get you wet wet
