                        Bài hát: Never Back Down - Two Steps From Hell

Standing still as they charge
We will hold our ground
Not back down
We will raise our swords
From the ground
And we will fight the war to end
All the suffering, never fearing
Heros foes or the daring
And their cause to the gods we pray
Never waive, time has come for us
To take charge and fight the power

Standing still as they charge
We will hold our ground
Not back down
We will raise our swords
From the ground
And we will fight the war to end
All the suffering, never fearing
Heros foes or the daring
And their cause to the gods we pray
Never waive, time has come for us
Let's obey and fight the power
                        
                    |
