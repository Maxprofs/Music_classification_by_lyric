                        Bài hát: Perfect Two - Nightcore

You can be the peanut butter to my jelly
You can be the butterflies I feel in my belly
You can be the captain
I can be your first mate
You can be the chills that I feel on our first date

You can be the hero
and I can be your sidekick
You can be the tear
that I cry if we ever split
You can be the rain from the cloud when it’s storming
or you can be the sun when it shines in the morning

Don't know if I could ever be
without you cause boy you complete me
and in time I know that we'll both see
that we're all we need

Cause you’re the apple to my pie
You’re the straw to my berry
You’re the smoke to my high
and you’re the one I wanna marry

Cause you’re the one for me for me
and I'm the one for you for you 
You take the both of us of us 
and we’re the perfect two

We’re the perfect two 
We’re the perfect two 
Baby me and you 
We’re the perfect two 

You can be the prince and I can be your princess
You can be the sweet tooth I can be the dentist
You can be the shoes and I can be the laces
You can be the heart that I spill on the pages

You can be the vodka and I can be the chaser
You can be the pencil and I can be the paper
You can be as cold as the winter weather
but I don't care as long as we’re together

Don’t know if I could ever be
without you cause boy you complete me
and in time I know that we'll both see
that we're all we need

Cause you’re the apple to my pie
You’re the straw to my berry
You’re the smoke to my high
and you’re the one I wanna marry

Cause you’re the one for me for me 
and I'm the one for you for you 
You take the both of us of us 
and we’re the perfect two

we’re the perfect two 
we’re the perfect two 
baby me and you 
we’re the perfect two 


You know that I’ll never doubt you
and you know that I think about you
and you know I can’t live without you

I love the way that you smile
and maybe in just a while
I can see me walk down the aisle


Cause you’re the apple to my pie
You’re the straw to my berry
You’re the smoke to my high
and you’re the one I wanna marry


Cause you are the one for me for me 
and I'm the one for you for you 
You take the both of us of us 
and we’ re the perfect two

We’re the perfect two 
we’re the perfect two 
baby me and you 
we’re the perfect two 
Yeah yeah...
