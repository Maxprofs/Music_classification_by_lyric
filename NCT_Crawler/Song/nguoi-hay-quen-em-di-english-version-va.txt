                        Bài hát: Người Hãy Quên Em Đi (English Version) - V.A

Hey baby, so we are apart today
There were one time endless kisses, now they all are gone
Your warmth is gone from my lips
Hey baby, the word ''love'' is now fading
I'm left with only lonely nights, and falling tears
Listen to the time ticking by

Please forget about me, and love me no more
If you have no more attachments to me
Please forget about me, and expect no more
Nothing to regret and no hard feelings
For this love would not last forever
Consider it a tender ending
Love is like a gentle breeze blowing
Please forget about me 

Our promises of being together
Remember we used to be so light and carefree
Just the two of us
So today, i'm bitterly hurt that you're changed
Our vows are gone with the wind and i'm left alone
Listen to my cry of pain

Please forget about me, and love me no more
If you have no more attachments to me
Please forget about me, and expect no more
Nothing to regret and no hard feelings
For this love would not last forever
Consider it a tender ending
Love is like a gentle breeze blowing
Please forget about me
                        
                    |
