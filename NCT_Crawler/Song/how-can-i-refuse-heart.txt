                        Wake me up with laughter, wrap me in your arms
 This ain't no mornin' after, it's never been so warm
 It didn't take so long for us to feel this way
 Can a good thing last longer than a day? Where do we take it now, now that we caught fire?
 Will something greater grow out of this desire?
 Should I drop my guard at the risk of being used?
 The way you do those things to me, how can I refuse? I could get addicted to your energy
 The way you take me over, hmm, keep pullin' on me
 Our hearts beat together, our timing is the same
 Can I trust my feelings and save myself the pain? Where do we take it now, now that we caught fire?
 Will something greater grow out of this desire?
 Should I drop my guard at the risk of being used?
 The way you do those things to me, how can I refuse? We could share the mystery and spare ourselves the misery
 Discover it again every day, we could take love all the way Where do we take it now, now that we caught fire?
 Will something greater grow out of this desire?
 Should I drop my guard at the risk of being used?
 The way you do those things to me, how can I refuse? How can I refuse you?
 How can I refuse you?
 How can I refuse you?
