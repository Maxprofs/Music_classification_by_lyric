                        Bài hát: Satellite (Chicago Typewriter OST) - Saltnpaper

I’m walking all night long in mysteries 
You’re singing all day long in maze 
Without song in my heart, it is a lie 
Still I am wondering why 

I’m feeling all my lights going out 
All I can hear is your lullaby 
From your guide now I’m here without knowing 
Those melodies I sing like I know 

Don’t wanna say goodbye 
I wanna hear your voices 
in dreams 
Don’t wanna see your tears 
I wanna see your traces 
I hear you 

Say I will 
If our tears haven’t fade away 
I may cross now or I won’t 
Say I will 
If our hands didn’t get to hold 
Hourglass stories of me and you, we loved 

Satellite love 
Through the rain, to the stars 
Satellite love 
Through the rain, to the stars 

Say I will 
If our tears haven’t fade away 
I may cross now or I won’t 
Say I will 
If our hands didn’t get to hold 
Hourglass stories of me and you someday 

Satellite love 
Satellite love 
Satellite love 
Satellite love
