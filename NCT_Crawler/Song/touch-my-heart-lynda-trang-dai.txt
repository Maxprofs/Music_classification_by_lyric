                        Song: Touch My Heart - Lynda Trang Đài

where is the sun i'm waiting for ? 
where is the one that i adore ? 
so hear me cry, where is your love? 
i need emotion. 

ten thousands miles away from you, 
there is a girl that waits for you, 
so take a chance or i will die 
i cant wait forever 
take me to the life.. 

Touch my heart, where's the man 
who will hold me and love me forever? 
touch my love, let me that you want me 
and let's stay together. touch my heart.. 

I'm sitting here i'm all alone, 
i need to have you on the phone. 
i feel so cold the night is gray. 
i'm just sad and lonely. 

where is the one i long to see? 
where are the nights of ecstacy ? 
so take a chance dont make me cry, 
i cant wait forever take me to the life.. 
(chorus is reiterated)
                        
                    |
