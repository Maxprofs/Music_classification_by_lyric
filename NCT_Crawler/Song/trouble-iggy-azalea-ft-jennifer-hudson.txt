Right
I should've known you were bad news
From the bad boy demeanor, and the tatoos
most guys only want one thing
But I'm undecided, trying to figure out if that's you
Either way though, I think you're worth a test drive
Cause the way is so much better than the next guy
And a little trouble only makes for a good time
So all the normal red flags be a good sign

Don't you come here thinkin your Ballin, ain't down for it
You seem like trouble to me
I can tell by the way that you lean
And the way that you kiss your teeth
And you turn up so flashy clean
Smells like trouble to me

Opposites attract, I guess this is it
Good girl bad guy, what a perfect match
And if I you, gonna wanna play baptized
Cause when you finish you gonna feel like you was baptized
See baby now you're fiendin for a test drive
Cause you don't wanna loose your ride to the next guy
And baby trouble only makes for a good time
So all the normal red flags be a good sign

Don't you come here thinkin your Ballin, ain't down for it
You seem like trouble to me
I can tell by the way that you lean
And the way that you kiss your teeth
And you turn up so flashy clean
Smells like trouble to me

I got it bad for him in the worst way
Dear Lord, how'd I get in this position
Should've never gotten involved in the first place
Second place never get the recognition
See what he doing to me make me have to should it out
Gotta hold on me that's without a doubt
So clear now he's a trouble starter
But I ain't a saint either and this ain't no still water

Just cause all the girls are Fallin at your feet
Don't mean nothin to me
Till you show me where it's at
Smells like trouble to me
Just cause all the girls are falling at your feet
Don't mean nothing to me
Till you show me where it's at
Smells like trouble to me

I should've known you were bad news (knew you were bad news)
From the bad boy demeanor and the tattoos (all of the tattoos)
I should've known you were bad news (knew you were bad news)
But I'm undecided trying to figure out if that's you (trouble to me)
Don't you come here thinking you Ballin, ain't down for it
You seem like trouble to me
I can tell by the way that you lean
And the way that you kiss your teeth
And you turn up so flashy clean
Smells like trouble to me
