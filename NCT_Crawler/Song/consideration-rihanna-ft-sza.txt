                        Bài hát: Consideration - Rihanna, SZA

[Verse 1: Rihanna]
I come fluttering in from Neverland
Time could never stop me, no, no, no, no
I know you try to
I come riding in on a pale white horse
Sending out his to less fortunate
I do advise you
Run it back, run it on back
When you're breaking it down for me
Cause I can hear you two times
Run it on back, will it ever make sense to me?

[Chorus: Rihanna]
I got to do things
My own way darling
Will you ever let me?
Will you ever respect me? No
Do things my own way darling
You should just let me
Why you will never let me grow?

[Post-Chorus: SZA]
When I look outside my window
I can't get no peace of mind
When I look outside my window
I can't get no peace of mind

[Verse 2: Rihanna]
Let me cover your *** in glitter
I can make it gold, gold
Heard you're tryna sell your soul, baby
But I'm not sure, you're running low, lately
I needed you to please give my reflection a break
From the face it’s seeing now
Darling would you mind giving my reflection a break
From the pain it’s feeling now?

[Chorus: RIhanna & SZA]
I got to do things
My own way darling
You should just let me
Will you ever respect me? No
Do things my own way darling
You should just let me
Why you will never let me grow

[Post-Chorus: SZA]
When I look outside my window
I can't get no peace of mind
When I look outside my window
I can't get no peace of mind

[Outro: SZA (Rihanna)]
Getting can't get no peace
Getting can't get no peace
Get, get, getting no peace
Can't get no peace
(Get, g-g-get no peace oh)
