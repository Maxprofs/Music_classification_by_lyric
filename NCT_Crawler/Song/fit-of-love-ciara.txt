yeah, yeah

i was colder than december
never thought that you would enter my life that day
love so gentle and so tender
and I really don't remember feeling this way

i owe it all to you
i feel so new
like i can't lose
and everybody knows 'cause it just shows
i wear a glow
i like the fit of love

up here with you is where I wanna be
and i'm not coming down
i like how your love just fits on me
like it's gently wrapped around
i'm covered from my head to my feet
with everything it does
it stays on me because (oh, yeah)
i like the fit of love

you're the reason and the meaning
for the new things i believe in
you make me smile (yeah...)
and i wouldn't change nothing
i won't wish you could've rushed it
don't wanna change the way it is (oh, no)

i'm in a better place
those hurtful days are gone away
and everybody sees that you love me
and i'm complete
i like the fit of love

up here with you is where I wanna be
and i'm not coming down
i like how your love just fits on me
like it's gently wrapped around
i'm covered from my head to my feet
with everything it does
it stays on me because
i like the fit of love

oh, when you was new with me
one night like i used to be
like you're still not for me (yeah...) ???
don't know how to take me now
and it ain't easy to break me down
'cause I'm wearing love on me
and it fits too deep
i like the fit of love

up here with you is where i wanna be
and i'm not coming down,
u like how your love just fits on me
like it's gently wrapped around
i'm covered from my head to my feet
with everything it does
it stays on me because...
i like the fit of love

up here with you is where i wanna be
and i'm not coming down,
i like how your love just fits on me
like it's gently wrapped around
i'm covered from my head to my feet
with everything it does
it stays on me because...
i like the fit of love
