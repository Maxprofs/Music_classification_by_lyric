                        Why you talk so loud?
 Why you talk so?
 Why you talk so loud?
 Why you talk so? Passing grammatical mistakes
 Totally wrecked and polemic in the way he talks
 Vocal sabbatical, delayed by churning out the same Why you talk so loud?
 Why you talk so?
 Why you talk so loud?
 Why you talk so? We don't got alarms we just use my dad's arms
 Excess until we stop hearts
 I think you're trying too hard with your lungs in tar
 And your kitchen full of pop stars And I've been thinking lots about your mouth
 A conversation superseded by the way he talks
 I'd be an anchor but I'm scared you'd drown
 It's safer on the ground Why you talk so loud?
 Why you talk so?
 Why you talk so loud?
 Why you talk so? Passing grammatical mistakes
 Totally wrecked and polemic in the way he talks
 Vocal sabbatical, delayed by churning out the same (Why you talk so loud?)
 And I've been thinking lots about your mouth
 (Why you talk so?)
 A conversation superseded by the way he talks
 (Why you talk so loud?)
 I've been thinking lots about your mouth
 (Why you talk so?)
