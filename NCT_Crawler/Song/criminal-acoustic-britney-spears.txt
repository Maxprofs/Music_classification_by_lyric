                        Bài hát: Criminal (Acoustic) - Britney Spears

Verse 1
He is a hustler
He's no good at all
He is a loser, he’s a bum, bum, bum, bum
He lies, he bluffs
He's unreliable.
He is a sucker with a gun, gun, gun, gun

I know you told me
I should stay away.
I know you said
He’s just a dog astray.
He is a rebel with a tainted heart
And even I know this a'int smart

[Chorus]

But mama im in love with a criminal
And this type of love
Isn't rational, it's physical
Mama please don't cry
I will be alright
All reasons inside
I just cant deny
Love the guy

Verse 2

He is a villain of the devil’s law
He is a killer just for fun, fun, fun, fun
That man's a snitch and unpredictable,
He’s got no conscious
He got none, none, none, none

All I know, should let go, but no
'cause he’s a rebel with a tainted heart

And even I know this ain't smart

[Chorus]

But mama im in love with a criminal
And this type of love
Isn't rational, it's physical
Mama please don't cry
I will be alright
All reasons inside
I just cant deny
Love the guy

[Bridge]

And he's got my name
Tatooed on his arm
His lucky charm,
So I guess its okay
He’s with me

And I hear people talk
Trying to make remarks
Keep us apart
But I don't even hear
I don't care

[Chorus]

'Cause mama im in love with a criminal
And this type of love
Isn't rational, it's physical
Mama please don't cry
I will be alright
All reasons inside
I just cant deny
Love the guy
