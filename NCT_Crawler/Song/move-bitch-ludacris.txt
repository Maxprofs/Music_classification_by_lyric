                        Bài hát: Move Bitch - Ludacris

[Chorus 2x: Ludacris]

Move bitch, get out the way
Get out the way bitch, get out the way
Move bitch, get out the way
Get out the way bitch, get out the way

[Ludacris]
OH NO! The fight's out
I'ma 'bout to punch yo...lights out
Get the *** back, guard ya grill
There's somethin' wrong, we can't stay still
I've been drankin' and bustin' two
and I been thankin' of bustin' you
Upside ya mother***in' forehead
And if your friends jump in, "Ohhh gurrlll", they'll be mo' dead
Causin' confusion, Disturbin Tha Peace
It's not an illusion, we runnin the streets
So bye-bye to all you groupies and golddiggers
Is there a bumper on your ass? NO NIGGA!
I'm doin' a hundred on the highway
So if you do the speed limit, get the *** outta my way
I'm D.U.I., hardly ever caught sober
and you about to get ran the *** over

[Chorus]

[Mystikal over second chorus]
BITCH! Watch out, watch out, watch out
BITCH! Watch out, watch out, watch out, move

Here I come, here I go
UH OH! Don't jump bitch, move
You see them headlights? You hear that ***in' crowd?
Start that *** show, I'm comin' through
Hit the stage and knock the curtains down
I *** the crowd up - that's what I do
Young and successful - a sex symbol
The bitches want me to *** - true true
Hold up wait up, shorty
"Oh wazzzupp, get my dick sucked, what are yoouu doin'?"
Sidelinin' my ***in' bussiness
Tryin' to get my baby child support soon
Give me that truck and take that rental back
Who bought these ***in' T.V.'s and jewelry bitch, tell me that?
No, I ain't bitter, I don't give a ***
But i'ma tell you like this bitch
You better not walk in front of my tour bus

[Chorus]

[I-20 over second chorus]
Bring it, get 'em

Too bad I'm on the right track
Beef, got the right mack
Hit the trunk, grab the pump pump, I'll be right back
We buyin' bars out, showin' scars out
We heard there's hoes out, so we brought the cars out
Grab the pills cuz we poppin tonight,
Beat the *** outta security for stoppin' tha fight
I got a fifth of the remy, *** the Belve and 'cris
I'm sellin' *** up in the club like I work in the bitch
*** the dress codes, it's street clothes, we all street niggaz
We on the dance floor, throwin' bows, beatin' up niggaz
I'm from the D.E.C., tryin' to disrespect D.T.P.
And watch the bottles start flyin' from the V.I.P.
*** this rap ***, we clap bitch, two in your body
Grab ya four, start a fight dog, ruin the party
So move bitch, get out the way hoe
All you faggot mother***ers make way for 2-0
So...

[Chorus]
