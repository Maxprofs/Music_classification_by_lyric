                        How long will they mourn me?
 Yeah! This for my nigga Kato
 It's still on nigga, believe that
 We live a Thug Life, Thugs for Life
 Yeah (How long will they mourn me?) We handle this *** for you bwoy
 Yeah nigga
 2Pac in this mother***er All my homies drinkin' liquor
 Tears in everybody's eyes
 Niggas cried, to mourn a homie's homicide
 But I can't cry, instead I'm just a shoulder
 Damn, why they take another soldier?
 I load my clip before my eyes blurry, don't worry
 I'll get them suckers back before your buried (***)
 Retaliate and pull a one-eight-seven
 Do real niggas get to go to heaven?
 How long will they mourn me? Bury me a mother***in' G
 Bitch don't wanna die, then, don't *** with me
 It's kinda hard to be optimistic
 When your homie's lyin' dead on the pavement twisted
 Y'all don't hear me doe, I'm tryin hard to make amends
 But I'm losin' all my mother***in' friends, damn!
 They should've shot me when I was born
 Now I'm trapped in the mother***in' storm
 How long will they mourn me? I wish it would have been another
 How long will they mourn me?
 How long, will they mourn my brother (Half them niggas all dead and ***)
 How long will they mourn me?
 I wish it would have been another (dedicated this to Kato nigga, and e'ry thug)
 How long will they mourn me?
 How long, will they mourn my brother (yo nigga, we gotta keep this *** goin' on, yo Syke) How long will they mourn me?
 Every mother***in' day homie
 You stayed down when the other niggas didn't know me
 From my heart to the trigger you my ***in' nigga
 And things won't be the same without ya nigga
 I remember kickin' back, you wanted a 'llac
 And goin' half on a mother***in' hundred sack
 Smokin' blunt after blunt, and steady drinkin'
 Hung around so much, you knew what I was thinkin'
 Tell me Lord, why you take big Kato?
 So confused not knowing which way to go
 I'm goin' crazy and runnin' out of ***in' time
 I can't take it, I'm losin' my ***in' mind
 So day after day, ride after ride
 We'll hook up on the other side
 Watch over your family and your newborn
 Till we meet again homie
 How long will they mourn me? I wish it would have been another (Big Kato)
 How long will they mourn me? 
 How long, will they mourn, my brother (It's still on nigga)
 How long will they mourn me?
 I wish it would have been another (Yeah)
 How long will they mourn me?
 How long will they mourn, my brother (Rated R, Double Jeapordy, Mac 10) Damn, a nigga tired of feelin' sad
 I'm tired of puttin' in work
 I'm tired of cryin' watchin' my homies leave the earth
 I know soon one day I'll be in the dirt
 And my peoples'll be mournin'
 When they get a call from the coroner
 All niggas can say is that's ***ed up
 And get tossed up, reminiscin' how we grew up (my nigga)
 Rest and love to my nigga Kato
 See you in the crossroads real soon
 For now let me pour out some brew
 I'll be always thinkin' of ya homie
 Rest in peace, how long will they mourn me? We know life's a ***in' trip
 And everybody gotta go
 But why the *** it have to be my nigga Kato?
 Another nigga fell victim to the chrome
 It's enough to make you crazy, it's ***in' with my dome
 You only live once on this earth a nigga had it bad
 Since the day, of my mother***in' birth (uh)
 But niggas say they down and they always be my homie
 But when a nigga gone, how long will ya mourn me?  (Yeah!) I wish it would have been another (Mac 10 in this mother***er, yeah!)
 How long will you mourn me?!
 How long, will they mourn my brother (Thug Life boy, Nate, blowin that ***)
 I wish it would have been another (Nate Dogg do that *** nigga, yeah)
 How long will you mourn me?!
 How long will they mourn, my brother (This for my nigga Kato, and all his kids)
 How long will you mourn me?!
 I wish it would have been another
 How long will they mourn my brother
