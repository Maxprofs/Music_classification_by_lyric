                        Bài hát: Where Did We Go Wrong? - Toni Braxton, Babyface

[Babyface]
For as long as I loved you girl
That I gave you all my love
With all my heart and soul
I thought that I was be the one
But you didn't appreciate a single I do
You just left me with a broken heart
Didn’t you, didn’t you?

[Toni]
I tried to tell you baby
Tried to tell you a thousand times
Ooh you wouldn’t listen baby
No matter how hard I tried
But you didn’t see the love
Was so in love with you
Then you went to break my heart
Didn’t you?

[Chorus]
Where did we go wrong?
Is it all my fault?
Where did we go wrong?
Is it all my fault?

[Babyface]
From the very start
I was so into you
Ooh from the beginning I was so so feeling you
But you thought I cheated, that I played around on you
But didn’t you do the same, didn’t you, didn’t you?

[Toni]
Ooh gotta tell you baby
I gotta let you know the deal
Ooh you drove first place baby
If we’re gonna keep it real
When you cheated, how you hurt my soul
Ooh you broke my heart, didn’t you?

[Chorus]
Where did we go wrong?
Is it all my fault?
Where did we go wrong?
Is it all my fault?

[Babyface]
I wish I would’ve listened
I wish I would’ve heard

[Toni]
Ooh I wish I would’ve touched you baby
I wish I would’ve said the words
That I love you, I love you
I love you
I love you, I love you

[Chorus]
So where did we go wrong?
Is it all my fault?
Where did we go wrong?
Is it all my fault?
                        
                    |
