                        Song: Man With The Bag - Jessie J


Oh Mr Cringle, I'm soon gonna jingle
The bells that'll tingle all your troubles away
Everyone's waiting for the man with the bag
Cause Christmas is coming again

He's got a sleighful, it's not gonna stay full
He's got stuff to drop at every stop on the way
Everyone's waiting for the man with the bag
Cause Christmas is coming again

He'll be here with the answers to the prayers
That you made through the year
You'll get yours if you've done
Everything you should, extra special good

He'll make this December one you'll remember
The best and the merriest you ever did have
Everybody's waiting for the man with the bag
Christmas is here again

Oh Mr Cringle, I'm soon gonna jingle
The bells that'll tingle all your troubles away
Everybody's waiting for the man with the bag
Christmas is here again

He's got a sleighful and it's not gonna stay full
He's got stuff to drop at every stop on the way
Everybody's waiting for the man with the bag
Christmas is here again

He'll be here with the answers to the prayers
That you made through the year
You'll get yours if you've done
Everything you should, extra special good

He'll make this December the one you'll remember
The best and the merriest you ever did have
Everybody's waiting, they're all congregating
Waiting for the man with the bag, waiting for the man with the bag

Merry Christmas
