                        Fussin' and fightin', we back at it again
 I know that, it's my fault, but you don't understand (no)
 I got memories, this is crazy
 You ain't nothing like the girl I used to know
 Good with ma, good with pa, cool with all my niggas
 I should try, truth is I wanna let you in, but no
 Damn these memories, and it's crazy
 You ain't nothing like the girl I used to know

 [Bridge:]
 Girl I really wanna work this out, cause I'm tired of fightin'
 And I really hope you still want me the way I want you
 I said I really wanna work this out, damn girl I'm tryin'
 It's no excuse, no excuse
 But I got this

 [Chorus:]
 I got this icebox where my heart used to be (but I got this)
 I got this icebox where my heart used to be (said I got this)
 I'm so cold, I'm so cold, I'm so cold, I'm so cold
 I'm so cold, I'm so cold, I'm so cold [x2]

 Why can't I get it right, just can't let it go
 I opened up, she let me down, I won't feel that no more
 I got memories, this is crazy
 She ain't nothing like the girl I used to know
 I don't mean to take it out on you baby but I can't help it
 'Cause my heart is in the same ol' condition that baby left it
 And I, I apologize, for makin' you cry
 Look me in my eye and promise you won't do me the same

 [Bridge:]
 Girl I really wanna work this out, 'cause I'm tired of fightin'
 And I really hope you still want me the way I want you
 I said I really wanna work this out, damn girl I'm tryin'
 It's no excuse, no excuse
 But I got this

 [Chorus:]
 I got this icebox where my heart used to be (but I got this)
 I got this icebox where my heart used to be (said I got this)
 I'm so cold, I'm so cold, I'm so cold, I'm so cold
 I'm so cold, I'm so cold, I'm so cold [x2]

 I don't wanna be stuck up in this cold cold world ('cause I don't wanna be) [2x]
 Don't wanna mess this up better keep your eye on me girl [6x]

 [Bridge:]
 Girl I really wanna work this out, cause I'm tired of fightin'
 And I really hope you still want me the way I want you
 I said I really wanna work this out, damn girl I'm tryin'
 It's no excuse, no excuse
 But I got this

 [Chorus:]
 I got this icebox where my heart used to be (but I got this)
 I got this icebox where my heart used to be (said I got this)
 I'm so cold, I'm so cold, I'm so cold, I'm so cold
 I'm so cold, I'm so cold, I'm so cold [x2]
