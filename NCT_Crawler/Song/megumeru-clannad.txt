Sukitooru yume wo miteita 
Yawarakai eienn
Kaze no youna kasuka na koega
Takai sora kara
Boku wo yonnde iru 
Kono mama tobi tateba
Doko ni datte yukeru


I was having a transparent dream
It was a tender eternity
The faint, wind-like voice
Is calling me from the high sky
If i take off while like this
I can go anywhere

Hikari no naka yurameita 
Kotobamo omoimo zennbu
Nokosazu tsutaete kitto


Surely, i'll unreservedly tell you
The words, thoughts, everything
That swayed in the light

Hutashikana kimochi wo idaku
Doushitemo huande
Imawa mada shiranai keredo
Itsuka sonomeni 
Utsuru toki gakuru
Sekai wa tsuzuiteru 
Kimi wo mezashi nagara
Kasaneta teto te no nakani 
Chiisana mirai ga mietara
Kiokuwo sa tokihanatou
Massugun a kokoro no sakini 
Tsunagaru jikannga arukara



I embrace an uncertain feeling
I feel uneasy no matter what
I still don't know now
But someday, the moment when 
I'll reflect in your eyes will come
The world continues on
While i'm gazing at you
If we can see a little future
Within our joined hands
Then c'mon, let's release our memories
Because there's a time that connects to
The tip of my straightforward heart

Tumetai asa no himo 
Mayowazuni susunnde yukuyo 
Itamimo kanasimi mo
Mikatani kaenagara 
Kimi wo terashiteiru 
Taikiga mada kienai no nara
Boku wo matteite 
Shizukani mioroshite



Even on the day of a cold morning
I'll move forward unhesitatingly
While i turn pain and sorrow
Into my allies
If the atmosphere that illuminates you
Hasn't disappeared yet
Then wait for me
And quietly look down

Kasaneta teto te no nakani 
Chiisana miraiga mietara 
Hikari no naka yurameita 
Kotobamo omoimo zennbu



If we can see a little future
Within our joined hands
Then the words, thoughts, everything
That swayed in the light-

Harukana kimi made 
Nokosazu tsutaete kitto


Surely, i'll unreservedly tell them
To the distant you
