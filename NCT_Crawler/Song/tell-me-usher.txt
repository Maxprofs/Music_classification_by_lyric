                        Bài hát: Tell Me - Usher

I just wanna....
I just wanna take my time... my time... my time with you

We're alone while the thunder is roaring
And the winds are blowing
'Cause it's storming and pouring tonight
I put my hand on your chest
I can feel your heart
And it's beating kinda fast, so is mine
And in this moment of silence you look me in the eyes
Nothing is verbalized, so much to say
I need you so much
The more I'm away from you, the more of you I want
(I need you)

I want to hold you till I can't feel again
Until your soul lets me in

Tell me that you wanna make love
Tell me that you wanna relieve love
Tell me that you wanna make love, yeah
Baby I'm a man that believes in what it is

We're going to a whole 'nother level
When we do it, it's so true
And it's so much more than sexual tonight
When we're connected, every touch, every kiss is perfected
It's like, when we finally found what we been looking for
It gets better and better with time
This is deeper than love
The more of you I have the more of you I want
(Uuh, I need you baby)

I want to hold you till I can't feel again
Until your soul lets me in

Tell me that you wanna make love
Tell me that you wanna relieve the love
Tell me that you wanna make love, yeah
Baby I'm a man that believes in what it is

Hey, hey
Oh baby can we go deeper
Deeper, never safer
Further than that

I want to hold you till I can't feel again
Until your soul lets me in

Tell me that you wanna make love
Tell me that you wanna relieve the love
Tell me that you wanna make love, yeah

Woman and man fight so hard
And the two become one, we work out our problems
And we fix it, whenever we get body to body
Body to body, body to body
(I want you)
When you so wet and I'm so hard
And when the two become one it's like oh my God
And then we feel like our spirits want to leave our body
Leave our body, leave our body

Until your soul lets me in
I want to

Woman and man fight so hard
And the two become one, we work out our problems
And we fix it, whenever we get body to body
Body to body, body to body
(I want you)
When you so wet and I'm so hard
And when the two become one it's like oh my God
And then we feel like our spirits want to leave our body
Leave our body, leave our body

Until your soul lets me in
(Uh, still here)
(I feel you there baby, I feel [?])
Say you'll never leave me, say you'll never go
I love you so much
