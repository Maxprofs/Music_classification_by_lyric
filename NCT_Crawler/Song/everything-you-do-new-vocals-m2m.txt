                        Everything you do
Verse 1
From the moment you looked at me
And ever since you called my name
You’ve been everything that I’ve seen
And know I’m caught up in this game

Pre-chorus
My mind is spinning round and around
There’s something special I have found
Every time I close my eyes
All I can think of is you and me
Oh baby can’t you see

Chorus
That everything you do
Everything that you do
Makes me wanna go...
Everything you say
Everything that you say
Makes me wanna go...

Verse 2
They’re trying to build a fence
By saying that this won’t last
They tell me I don’t have a chance
That everything moves too fast

Verse 3
But every time I close my eyes
All I can think of is you and me
Oh baby can’t you see

Chorus 2x

Pre-chorus

Bridge
That everything you do
Everything you do
Everything you do
Everything you say
Everything that you say

Chorus 2x
