                        Dislocate your spine if you don't sign
He says I'll have you seeing double
Mesmerize you when he's tongue tied
Simply with those eyes
Synchronize your minds and see the beast within him
rise

Don't look back, don't look back
It's a rip off
Flick of the wrist and your dead baby
Blow him a kiss and you're mad
Flick of the wrist, he'll eat your heart out
A dig in the ribs and then a kick in the head
He's taken an arm, he's taken a leg
All this time honey, baby you've been had

Intoxicate your brain with what I saying
If not you'll lie in knee deep trouble
Prostitute yourself he says
Castrate your human pride
Sacrifice your leisure days
Let me squeeze you till you've dried

Don't look back, don't look back
It's a rip off

Work my fingers to my bones, I scream with pain
I still make no impression
Seduce you with his money-make machine
Cross collaterize (big time money money)
Reduce you to a muzak fake machine
Then the last goodbye
It's a ripoff

Flick of the wrist and your dead baby
Blow him a kiss and you're mad
Flick of the wrist, he'll eat your heart out
A dig in the ribs and then a kick in the head
He's taken an arm, he's taken a leg
All this time honey, baby you've been had
                        
                    |
