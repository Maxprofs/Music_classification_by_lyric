                        Shh!
 Gurl, gurl, gurl, gurl, gurl, gurl, gurl
 All I can say is
 Gurl, gurl, gurl, gurl, gurl, gurl, gurl

 [Verse:]
 Lets Go!
 I don't need nobody else around see
 Love the way you compliment my style
 Though you may end up bein' my only gurl
 Cause when ur with me ur my whole world
 Like when it's just me and you
 Vibe is crazy between us two
 Ur my homie my lover and even my friend
 Now I said this before ima say it again

 Now here is the situtaion
 I like what weve got happening
 And I don't want nothing comin in betweenn both me and you
 I'll let you be lieutenant if you let me be captain
 Tell me if that's cool

 [Chorus:]
 Baby I want you to be my entourage
 (Super fly chick)
 You could be my personal superstar
 (Super fly chick)
 Baby I want you to be my entourage
 (Super fly chick)
 If you want then we could take this very far
 (Super fly chick)

 [Verse 2:]
 Your a star in ur own right
 At times you steal the whole spotlight
 I don't mind gurl you're fine put a Smile on my face
 Besides who want a chick that no dude would chase
 Sometimes I know your unsure
 Wonder if this will endure
 Don't make me make a promise that I can't keep
 Cause it's cool how it is lets not complicate things Gurl

 Here is the situtaion
 I like what weve got happening and I don't want nothing comin in between both me and you
 I'll let you be lieutenant if you let me be captain
 Tell me if that's cool

 [Chorus:]

 [Bridge:]
 You're a star (omarion)
 That you are (so beautiful)
 Be my girl (I wanna take it to the top)
 Share my world (all the way 2 the top Yeah!)
 Come on girl (Whoo! Super fly chick)

 [Chorus:]
                        
                    |
