                        It's getting near dawn
 When lights close their tired eyes
 I'll soon be with you, my love
 To give you my dawn surprise I'll be with you darling, soon
 I'll be with you when the stars start falling down
 When they're falling down I've been waiting so long
 To be where I'm going
 In the sunshine of your love I'm with you, my love
 The light's shining through on you
 Yes, I'm with you, my love
 It's the morning and just we two I'll stay with you darling, now
 I'll stay with you till my seeds are all dried up
 When they're all dried up I've been waiting so long
 To be where I'm going
 In the sunshine of your love I'm with you, my love
 The light's shining through on you
 Yes, I'm with you, my love
 It's the morning and just we two I'll stay with you darling, now
 I'll stay with you till my seeds are all dried up
 When they're all dried up I've been waiting so long
 I've been waiting so long
 I've been waiting so long
 To be where I'm going
 In the sunshine of your love
 Your love, your love
