                        Bài hát: Love Someone - Jason Mraz 

Love is a funny thing 
Whenever I give it – it comes back to me 
And it’s wonderful to be giving with my whole heart 
As my heart receives your love 

Oh, ain’t it nice this life we got each other 
I am right beside you 
More than just a partner or a lover, 
I’m your friend 

When you love someone 
Your heartbeat beats so loud 
When you love someone 
Your feet can’t feel the ground 
Shining stars all seem to congregate around your face 
When you love someone 
It comes back to you 

And love is a funny thing 
It’s making my blood flow with energy 
And it’s like an awakened dream 
Oh what I’ve been wishing for is happening 
And it’s right on time 

Oh ain’t it nice tonight we got each other 
I am right beside you 
More than just a partner or a lover 
I’m your friend 

When you love someone 
Your heartbeat beats so loud 
When you love someone 
Your feet can’t feel the ground 
Shining stars all seem to congregate around your face 
When you love someone 

When you love someone 

I gonna give myself to love tonight 
I'll lift you up to touch the moonlight 
And we will savor every second we 
Spend together you and I will 

We're gonna give ourselves to love tonight 
Lifting up to touch the starlight 
And we will savor every second we 
Suspend together you and I will 
You and I will, you and I will 

When you love someone 
Your heartbeat beats so loud 
When you love someone 
Your feet can’t feel the ground 
Shining stars all seem to congregate 
Around your face when you love someone 
When you love someone 
It comes back to you
                        
                    |
