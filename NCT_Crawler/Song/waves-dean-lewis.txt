                        Bài hát: Waves - Dean Lewis

[Verse 1]
There is a swelling storm
And I’m caught up in the middle of it all
And it takes control of the person that I thought I was
The boy I used to know
But there is a light in the dark
And I feel its warmth
In my hands, in my heart
But why can’t I hold on?

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause it comes and goes in waves
It always does
It always does
We watch as our young hearts fade
Into the flood
Into the flood

[Chorus]
And the freedom of falling
And the feeling I thought was set in stone
It slips through my fingers
And I'm trying hard to let go
But it comes and goes in waves
'Cause it comes and goes in waves
And carries us away

[Verse 2]
Through the wind
Down to the place we used to lay when we were kids
Memories of a stolen place
Caught in the silence
An echo lost in space

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause it comes and goes in waves
It always does
It always does
We watch as our young hearts fade
Into the flood
Into the flood

[Chorus]
And the freedom of falling
And the feeling I thought was set in stone
It slips through my fingers
And I'm trying hard to let go
But it comes and goes in waves
'Cause it comes and goes in waves
And carries us away

[Bridge]
I've watched my wild youth disappear in front of my eyes
Moments of magic and wonder
It seems so hard to find
Is it ever coming back again?
Is it ever coming back again?
Take me back to the feeling when
Everything was left to find

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause it comes and goes in waves
It always does
It always does

[Chorus]
And the freedom of falling
And the feeling I thought was set in stone
It slips through my fingers
And I'm trying hard to let go
But it comes and goes in waves
'Cause it comes and goes in waves
And carries us away
                        
                    |
