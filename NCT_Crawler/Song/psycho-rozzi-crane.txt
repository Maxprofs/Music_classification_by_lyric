                        Maybe I'm psycho, maybe I'm a little out of touch
 Maybe I'm delusional, or a shot glass away from insane
 Maybe I'm foolish, maybe I'm disconnected from all of reality
 But that's fine with me, cause I'm happy here It's my life, it's my voice, it's my mind, I can do
 What I want, all I want, I don't have to ask you
 What to do, what to say, I'm so free, I'm so brave
 So tonight, be like me, just lift your hands and say "yeah"! Tonight I'm gonna be as free as birds are
 Fly away no matter where or how far
 Tonight I'm gonna switch up the way things are
 Tear down these walls and break away I'll do time for my crime if I'm wrong, but I'm right
 No need to speak for me, I fight my own fight
 I came here by myself and I'm leaving out the same way
 Only I can say this, so I'mma take my chances Try it out, try it out, try it out, hey
 Try it out, try it out, try it out, hey
 Try it out, try it out, try it out, hey
 Try it out, try it out (x2)
 You should try it out
 You, you, you should, you should
 Maybe... I'm happy here, I'm feeling good here
 I'm feeling good, I'm feeling good
 I'm happy here
 I'm feeling good, I'm feeling good
 I'm happy here
 I'm feeling good, I'm feeling good
 So happy here
