The necktie and white shirt you bought me
The pants that I haven’t worn for a short while
I wear it by myself and lalala
I feel good by myself lalala

The old sticker pictures that I took out again
The pictures where you and I are happily smiling
I look at them by myself and lalala
I feel good by myself lalala
Why am I still, why am I still here, why am I still like this?

I’ll call you again baby, no
I’ll be better so you won’t cry
I miss you so much
Your eyes, you nose, your lips

I try to eat with you but you’re not here
I try to watch a movie with you but you’re not here
We have nothing, we really have nothing

Every day every say
I walk on this street again with you
If only I can walk with you again
If only we can walk together again (I’d like it)

The song you always played for me
Now it’s the song that I play for you
I listen to it by myself and lalala
I feel good by myself lalala

I walk on this street without you, I get in the car without you
I run away and run away but in the end, I’m a fool blind for you
It feels like no one is looking for me
It feels like your brightly shining heart is already closed (hey)

I try to eat with you but you’re not here
I try to watch a movie with you but you’re not here
We have nothing, we really have nothing

Every day every say
I walk on this street again with you
If only I can walk with you again
If only we can walk together again

Why am I still, why am I still here, why am I still like this?

My memories scatter like smoke, you’re right girl
It hurts a lot, sick my heart

The break up that I thought would never come to us
It came to me secretly and it so easily made love silently leave me

I try to go back but you’re not there
No matter how much I call you, you’re not there
We have nothing, we really have nothing

Every day every say
I walk on this street again with you
If only I can walk with you again
If only we can walk together again

Baby I just wanna spend some time with you
Baby I just wanna spend some time with you
Baby I just wanna spend some time with you
Baby I just wanna spend some time with you
