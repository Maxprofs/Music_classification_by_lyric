                        (Mckernan / Tanega)

 Who am I
 To say you didn't love me?
 When I can't remember
 The colour of your eyes
 The colour of your eyes

 I don't know
 How I missed loving you
 Still I can't remember
 The colour of your eyes
 The colour of your eyes

 Why didn't you see me
 Standing there
 Standing there with dreams of love?
 To fill the empty shades of grey

 I can see
 Now that you're leaving me
 All the shades of autumn
 In the colour of your eyes
 The colour of your eyes
 The colour of your eyes
 The colour of your eyes
 The colour of your eyes
                        
                    |
