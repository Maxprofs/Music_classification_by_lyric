                        There's a boy on my mind and he knows I'm thinking of him
On my way
through the day and the night The star shine above me He's been gone for
some time but I know I truly love him
And I'm singing a song hoping he'll be back
When he hears it

Chorus
My heart goes sha la la la la Sha la la in the morning Sha la la sha la la in the sunshine
Sha la la la la Sha la la in the evening
Sha la la la la Sha la la la just for you

If your love's gone away just like mine
You'll fell like crying
Sing along maybe once maybe twice
Let's try it together
Some sweet day no one knows you'll return
And you'll be happy shout it l,
sweet in a song listen to your heart
It is singing

Chorus
                        
                    |
