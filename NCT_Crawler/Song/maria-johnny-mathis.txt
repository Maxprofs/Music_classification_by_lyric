                        Maria, the most beautiful sound I ever heard
 (Maria, Maria, Maria, Maria)
 All the beautiful sounds of the world in a single word
 (Maria, Maria, Maria, Maria, Maria, Maria) Maria, I just met a girl named Maria
 And suddenly that name will never be the same to me
 Maria, I just kissed a girl named Maria
 And suddenly, I found how wonderful a sound can be Maria, say it loud and there's music playing
 Say it soft and it's almost like praying
 Maria, I'll never stop saying Maria
 (Maria, Maria, Maria, Maria, Maria) Maria, Maria, say it loud and there's music playing
 Say it soft and it's almost like praying
 Maria, I'll never stop saying Maria
 The most beautiful sound I ever heard, Maria
