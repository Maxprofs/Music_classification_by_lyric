 Rugged and rough that's how I do it

 K
 Keep it movin'

 I
 Stand alone

 M

 Verse #1

 Hey when Rak come along
 its a rap ya'll relax
 the alminac
 just show me where the parties at
 seminars and tracks
 closed comas and cardiacs
 broads and cats screamin "oh my god, hes back"
 just imagine, I hit the lab and get it crackin
 A thousand styles and one verse wearing the swiss patterns
 chicks get stabbed in the back til they have spasms
 known to spit a magnum or split a atom
 who would of known that jesus would come back to the ghetto
 on that level
 like a black pharoah with packed metal
 so black rebels, a black pedal
 the pharoah with 5 bevels and take a word of rap
 gettin bazaarre, oh hardcore
 this is for y'all, the crib or the par
 playin when you get in the car
 chill at the bar, spit somethen or split a cigar
 get with yah dogs to bring along to the bar

 Chorus x2

 Verse #2

 I used to paint this flo' on nathan scrolls
 then learned to make this doe with gangstas roll
 think like the late great capone, but the bank is closed
 these cats that think they ball but they aint this cold
 I'm from new york city, even where pretty chicks act dark
 niggas get clapped up, you stack up, they stick that up
 put the strap up, you thought my name was kid, back up
 big niggas, *spit* pick that up or lick that up
 raised by gangsters and gamblers, hustlers, conartists, convicts, killers and dons
 drug dealers, players and pimps, smooth talkers, stick up kids, thugs, real niggas and dogs
 wanted by every soul and lay dead in the turf
 cursed by every spirt and never made it to birth
 since the moon seperated from earth
 that's why they say that's why I'm the greatest that ever orcahstrated a verse

 Chours x2

 Verse #3

 Hey yo
 toast to that, its the cat that broke backs to a sold clap or smoke a track, how dope is that
 pope will rap, wrote back the most slack
 they know back before they turned coke to crack
 to my dawgs hearin sirens on the firearms
 i'll come, dyin wars and behind iron bars
 the boulevard retire broads when I aint bob
 try and rob my dialog, I am god
 chicks moan to get next to my throne, sniff my cologne and get rak alone
 s** pots at home, the tests gots to go
 caress spots, dressed up, fed rocks to bone
 hit the floors, its for 2003
 hits galore, who rock a style as wild as me
 rest assured when I rock dance crowds, they scream
 bitch malore, I rock mine out rahim

 Chorus x4
