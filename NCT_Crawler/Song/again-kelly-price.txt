                        Sorry, I never meant to hurt you
 You know I really love you and
 If you give me one more chance
 I'll prove it to you Stop, 'cause I don't wanna hear it
 Please don't say your same old speech
 Another time, think I have it
 Memorized Again, boy you lied to me
 Again, and you're hurting me again
 I've made up my mind
 And I won't take you back this time Again don't start calling me
 Again no apologies, again
 I won't change my mind
 I won't take you back this time I'm sorry, those words for you are easy
 You think that they appease me
 But I know now they're just two words
 You use to play me Stop, 'cause I will not believe it
 This time I'm leaving
 All the hurt and pain behind
 So I can just be happy once again Happy once again
 This time I will find someone to love me
 And find someone to really be my friend
 I'll be happy once again, never will I let
 Another hurt me, like you hurt me so, again Mr. Eric Clapton Again, boy you lied to me
 Again, and you're hurting me again
 I've made up my mind
 And I won't take you back this time Again don't start calling me
 Again no apologies, again
 I won't change my mind
 I won't take you back this time Again, boy you lied to me
 Again, and you're hurting me again
 I've made up my mind
 And I won't take you back this time Again don't start calling me
 Again no apologies, again
 I won't change my mind
 I won't take you back this time Again, again
