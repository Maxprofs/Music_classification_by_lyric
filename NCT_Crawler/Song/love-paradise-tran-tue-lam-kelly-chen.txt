                        Bài hát: Love Paradise - Kelly Chen (Trần Tuệ Lâm)

You're always on my mind
All day just all the time
You're everything to me
Brightest star to let me see
You touch me in my dreams
We kiss in every scence
I pray to be with you through rain and shiny days

I'll love you till i die
Deep as sea, wide as sky
The beauty of our love paints rainbows everywhere we come
Need you all my life
You're my hope
You're my pride
In your arm i find my heaven
In your eyes my sea and sky
May life be our love paradise
