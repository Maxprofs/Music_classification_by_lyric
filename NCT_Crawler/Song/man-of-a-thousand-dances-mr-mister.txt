                        Who is following me?
 Who is following me? Should I run? Should I hide?
 Should I act like a different man?
 Will I have to face my fear?
 Who is following me? Standing in the shadows
 (I just don't know)
 Reaching for the light
 (Just give me a sign)
 Take this empty spirit
 (Where will I go?)
 Throw away my pride
 (What will I find?) Who is watching me?
 Somebody's watching me Get so close and lose it all
 Get so high and then I fall
 But I know through it all
 He is watching me Standing in the shadows
 (I just don't know)
 Reaching for the light
 (Gotta give me a sign)
 Take this empty spirit
 (Where will I go?)
 Throw away my pride
 (What will I find?) I'm a man of a thousand dances
 Just a man of a thousand dreams
 I'm just a man of a thousand dances
 I'm a man and I want to be free Standing in the shadows
 Reaching for the light
 Take this empty spirit
 Throw away my pride Standing in the shadows
 Reaching for the light
 Take this empty spirit
 Throw away my pride Hallelujah
 Hallelujah
 Hallelujah
 Hallelujah Hey
 Thank you Lord I'm a man of a thousand dances
 I'm a man of a thousand, a thousand, a thousand dreams
