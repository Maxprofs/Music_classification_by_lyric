                        Until the day I die
I'll spill my heart for you
Until the day I die
I'll spill my heart

As years go by I race the clock with you
But if you died right now you know that I'd die to, I'd die too
You remind me of the times when I knew who I was
(When I knew who I was)
But still the second hand will catch us like it always does

We'll make the same mistakes take the fall for you
Hope you need this now I know I still do

Until the day I die
(Until the day I die)
I'll spill my heart for you, for you
Until the day I die
(Until the day I die)
I'll spill my heart for you

Should I bite my tongue until blood soaks my shirt?
Never fall apart so tell me why this hurts so much
My hands are at your throat and I think I hate you
But still we'll say, "Remember when"
( From: http://www.***/read/s/story-of-the-year-lyrics/until-the-day-i-die-lyrics.html )
Just like we always do, just like we always do

Until the day I die
(Until the day I die)
I'll spill my heart for you, for you
Until the day I die
(Until the day I die)
I'll spill my heart for you

Yeah I'd spill my heart
Yeah I'd spill my heart for you

My hands are at your throat I think I hate you
We made the same mistakes, mistakes like friends do
My hands are at your throat and I think I hate you
We made the same mistakes we made the same mistakes

Until the day I die
I'll spill my heart for you, for you

Until the day I die
(Until the day I die)
I'll spill my heart for you, for you
Until the day I die
(Until the day I die)
I'll spill my heart for you

Until the day I die
(Until the day I die)
Until the day I die
