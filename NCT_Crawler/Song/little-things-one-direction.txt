                        Your hand fits in mine like it's made just for me
But bear this in mind, it was meant to be
And I'm joining up the dots, with the freckles on your cheeks
And it al makes sense to me

I know you've never loved the crinkles by your eyes when you smile
You've never loved your stomach or your thighs
The dimples in your back at the bottom of your spine
But i'll love them endlessly

I won't let these little things slip out of my mouth
But if I do, it's you, oh it's you
They add up to, i'm in love with you
And all these little things

You can't go to bed without a cup of tea
And maybe that's the reason you talk in your sleep
And all those conversations are the secrets that I keep
Though it makes no sense to me
I know you've never love the sound of your voice on tape
You never want to know how much you weigh
You still have to squeeze into your jeans
But you're perfect to me

I won't let these little things slip out of my mouth
But if it's true, it's you, it's you
They add up to, i'm in love with you
And all these little things

You'll never love yourself half as much as I love you'll never treat yourself right darlin'
But I want you to
If I let you know i'm here for you
Maybe you'll love yourself like I love you, ohhh

I've just let these little things out of my mouth
Cause it's you, oh it's you, it's you
They add up to, and i'm in love with you
And all these little things

I won't let these little things slip out of my mouth
But if it's true, it's you, it's you
They add up to, i'm in love with you
And all your little things
                        
                    |
