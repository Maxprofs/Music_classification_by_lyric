                        And here I am, and here I'll stay
I will be your shelter

A shelter for your heart

I will be a harbor when the world is cold and dark

I will stand beside you

Through this whole life long

To love you and to give you

Shelter from the storm



You are the love, love of my life



Til the stars in heaven

Fall down from the sky

Til the silent waters and the rivers all run dry

I will stand beside you

Through this whole life long

To love you and to be your

Shelter from the storm
                        
                    |
