                        Bài hát : Frame Of Mind - Tristam, Braken

For now you can stay
Right there we will play
Until some how you can find
Slightly different Frame of Mind
Right here in my arms
Away from all harm
You'll be safe from all the flares.
All though i know you don't care

You can lift your head up to the sky
Take a deeper breath than give it time
You can walk the path among the lines
With your shattered Frame of Mind
Once that you can always stay
We can wait right here and play
Until somehow you can find
A slightly better Frame of Mind

[ Braken ( ôi giọng hay *** :"> )
When they say you will fall
You can reach nothing at all
Hide your tracks
Beneath the line
of a different Frame Of Mind
Is that what you heard
Broken words in the dirt
Yelling out into the sun
Here we come ( x6 ) 

You can lift your head up to the sky
Take a deeper breath than give it time
You can walk the path among the lines
With your shattered Frame of Mind
Once that you could always stay
We can wait right here and play
Until somehow you can find
A slightly better Frame of Mind

You can lift your head up to the sky
Take a deeper breath than give it time
You can walk the path among the lines
With your shattered Frame of Mind
Once that you could always stay
We can wait right here and play
Until somehow you can find
A slightly better Frame of Mind

And when daylight comes through
When the day is a new
That it'll be time
for a new Frame of Mind
When all eyes are on you
You will know what to do
Since you would have found
Your new Frame of Mind

You can lift your head up to the sky
Take a deeper breath than give it time
You can walk the path among the lines
But always know that you'll be safe
I'll be here throughout you days
Come find me and we'll play
                        
                    |
