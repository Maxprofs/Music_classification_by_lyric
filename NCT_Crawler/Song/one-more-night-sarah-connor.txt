Âu Mỹ khác|

                        One touch that was all it took
And I was hypnotized
One look that was just enough
To loose myself inside of you

I wish I could stop the time
To love you day and night
That one night was just too short
I wanna do it one more time

I know you're with someone else
I knew it was a one night stand
But never the less
Without the stress
Let's do it once again

I wish I could turn back the time
Lay your body next to mine
Love you for the second time
One more night with you
I wish I could just stop the time
Play the button, press rewind
Love you for the second time
One more night

It's just like we've met before
It feels like déja vu
I'm longing real bad for you
I'll pay the price to be your fool

And sell my soul for what you like
And trade it in for one more night
Because one night is way too short
I want some more
And that's for sure

I know you're with someone else
I know that it was a one night stand
But never the less
Without the stress
Let's do it once again

I wish I could turn back the time
Lay your body next to mine
Love you for the second time
One more night with you
I wish I could just stop the time
Play the button, press rewind
Love you for the second time
One more night

One touch
One night
That special part of mine
One love is alright
One more night

I wish I could turn back the time
Lay your body next to mine
Love you for the second time
One more night with you
I wish I could just stop the time
Play the button, press rewind
Love you for the second time
One more night
                        
                    |
