                        Bài hát: Revolution (Sean & Bobo Remix) - Diplo

Can you see it?
The worst is over
The monsters in my head are scared of love
Fallin people, listen up!
It's never too late to change your luck

So don't let them steal your light
E eh eh eh eh
Don't let them break your stride
E eh eh eh eh
There is light on the other side
And you'll see all the raindrops falling behind
It's a revolution
And we'll make it out tonight
It's a revolution
Rev, it's a reva
Oh oh oooh oh oooh oh oooh oh

Can you see it?
The worst is over

So, don't let them steal your light
E eh eh eh eh
Don't let them break your stride
E eh eh eh eh
There is light on the other side
And you'll see all the raindrops falling behind
It's a revolution
And we'll make it out tonight
It's a revolution
Rev, rev, it's a reva, rev, rev

Oh oh oooh oh oooh oh oooh oh
Oh oh oooh oh oooh oh oooh oh
Rev, rev
