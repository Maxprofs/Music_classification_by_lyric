                        Only you
 Have the power to move me
 And together we'll make
 The whole world move in sympathy
 But I could not see before Only you
 (Just you)
 Have the power to move me
 (You got the power to move me)
 Take me, hold me, mold me
 Change me and improve me
 It's not funny anymore There was I
 (There was I)
 Wondering why
 (I was wondering why)
 Every day disappeared into the distance Now with you
 The light is shining through
 You gave me life not just existence Only you
 (You are the starlight)
 Have the power to move me
 And together we'll make
 The whole world move in sympathy Only you
 Have the power to move me There was I
 (There was I)
 Wondering why
 (Wondering why)
 Every day disappeared into the distance Now with you
 The light is shining through
 You gave me life not just existence Only you
 (Only you)
 Have the power to move me
 And together we'll make
 The whole world move in sympathy
 But I could not see before
 (I couldn't see it before) That only you
 Have the power to move me
 Take me, hold me, mold me
 Change me and improve me Only you
 (Only you)
 Have the power to move me
