Âu Mỹ khác|

                        I wake up in the morning
So far away from home
Trying to make it through the day
Many miles are between us
I'm sending my love
From this payphone

Through the storms we've wandered
Many mountains we have climbed
But all the bad times are behind
The road is free - I'm coming home

Without you I'm like
A ship without its sails
Calling the wind to save me
I'd climb the highest mountain
I'd cross the seven seas
Just to see your smile again

All the trust that was built along the years
Is coming back to stay I know
Just look ahead
The road is free - I'm coming home

With every step I'm closer to home
When I'm back you won't be alone
Soon I see the familiar door before my eyes
And you

Through the storms we've wandered
Many mountains we have climbed
But all the bad times are behind
The road is free - I'm coming home

Through the storms we've wandered
Many mountains we have climbed
The road is free and I'm coming home
Through the storms we've wandered
Just look ahead - The road is free
                        
                    |
