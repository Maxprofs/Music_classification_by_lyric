                        Bài hát: Irreplaceable - Beyonce

To the left, to the left
To the left, to the left

Mmmm...
To the left, to the left
Everthing you own in the box to the left
In the closet, that's my stuff
Yes, if I bought then please don't touch (Don't touch)

And keep talkin' that mess that's fine
But could you walk and talk at the same time?
And, it's my name that's on that jag
So remove your bags let me call you a cab

Standin' in the front yard tellin' me how I'm such a fool
Talkin' 'bout, I'll never ever find a man like you
You got me twisted

[chorus:]
You must not know 'bout me
You must not know 'bout me
I could have another you in a minute,
Matter fact, he'll be here in a minute, baby
You must not know 'bout me
You must not know 'bout me
I could have another you by tomorrow
So don't you ever for a second get to thinkin'
You're irreplaceable

So go ahead and get gone, call up that chick,
And see if she's home
Oops, I bet you thought, that I didn't know,
What did you think, I was puttin' you out for

Because you was untrue, rollin' her around in the car that I bought you
Baby drop them keys
Hurry up before your taxi leaves

Standin' in the front yard tellin' me how I'm such a fool
Talkin' 'bout, I'll never ever find a man like you
You got me twisted

[chorus:]
You must not know 'bout me
You must not know 'bout me
I could have another you in a minute
Matter fact, he'll be here in a minute, baby
You must not know 'bout me
You must not know 'bout me
I could have another you by tomorrow
So don't you ever for a second get to thinkin'
You're irreplaceable

So since I'm not your everything
How about I'll be nothing, nothing at all to you?
Baby I won't shed a tear for you (I won't shed a tear)
I won't lose a wink of sleep (A wink of sleep)
'Cause the truth of the matter is
Replacing you is so easy, hey...

To the left, to the left
To the left, to the left
Mmmm...
To the left, to the left
Everything you own in the box to the left
To the left, to the left
Don't you ever for a second get to thinkin'
Your irreplaceable

[chorus:]
You must not know 'bout me
You must not know 'bout me
I could have another you in a minute
Matter fact, he'll be here in a minute, baby
You must not know 'bout me
You must not know 'bout me
I could have another you by tomorrow
So don't you ever for a second get to thinkin'
(Baby hey yeah!)

[chorus:]
You must not know 'bout me
You must not know 'bout me
I could have another you in a minute
Matter fact, he'll be here in a minute

You can pack all your bags we're finished (You must not know 'bout me)
'Cause you made your bed now lay in it (You must not know 'bout me)
I could have another you by tomorrow
Don't you ever for a second get to thinkin'
You're irreplaceable?
