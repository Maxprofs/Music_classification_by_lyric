                        Here we go, here we go, here we go, go, go
 Here we go, here we go, here we go, go, go
 Go, go, go

 Got to go, got to get away, gotta move on from yesterday
 No time to waste, no, no time you know
 Should have left long time ago

 Oh oh, oh oh, come and meet the baby Valvamos
 Take a look around baby
 Time to go

 Here we go, here we go, here we go, go, go
 Here we go, here we go, here we go, go, go
 Go, go, go

 Ah, na, na, na, no, no need for tears
 Mother like to live again in fear
 If you feel that I need to know
 Hold my hand and off we go

 Oh oh, oh oh, come and meet the baby Valvamos
 Take a look around baby
 Time to go

 If you feelin’ down I’ll know
 If I’m feelin’ down you’ll know
 If you feelin’ down I’ll know
 If I’m feelin’ down you’ll know

 Here we go, here we go, here we go, go, go
 Here we go, here we go, here we go, go, go
 Here we go, here we go, here we

 So here we go ma, no need to panic
 Lets take a little trip and play pool with the planets
 In outer space I’ll feed you pomegranates
 Of course you could fly the spaceship is automatic

 That’s when she cried when her perm got messed up
 Because of hyper dry
 We don’t lead the other folks bones, we got our own light
 Speed light, vroom like, vroom

 If you feelin’ down I’ll know
 If I’m feelin’ down you’ll know
 If you feelin’ down I’ll know
 If I’m feelin’ down you’ll know

 Here we go, here we go, here we go, go, go
 Here we go, here we go, here we go, go, go
 Here we go, here we go, here we go, go, go

 Here we go, here we go
 Here we go, here we go
 Here we go, here we go
 Here we go, here we go
 Here we go, go, go, go
