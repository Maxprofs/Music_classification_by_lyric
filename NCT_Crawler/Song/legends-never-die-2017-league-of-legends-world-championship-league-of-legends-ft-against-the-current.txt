                        Bài hát: Legends Never Die - League Of Legends, Against The Current

Legends Never Die when the world is calling you
Can you hear them screaming out your name?
Legends Never Die they become a part of you
Every time you bleed for reaching greatness 
Relentless you survive

They never lose hope when everything's cold and the fighting's near
It's deep in their bones they’ll run into smoke when the fire is fierce
'Oh pick yourself up, ‘cause

Legends Never Die when the world is calling you
Can you hear them screaming out your name?
Legends Never Die they become a part of you
Every time you bleed for reaching greatness 
Legends Never Die

They're written down in eternity
But you'll never see the price it costs, the scars collected all their lives
When everything’s lost, they pick up their hearts and avenge defeat
Before it all starts, they suffer through harm just to touch a dream
'Oh pick yourself up, ‘cause

Legends Never Die when the world is calling you
Can you hear them screaming out your name?
Legends Never Die they become a part of you
Every time you bleed for reaching greatness 
Legends Never Die

When the world is calling out your name
Begging you to fight
Pick yourself up once more
Pick yourself up, ‘cause

Legends Never Die when the world is calling you
Can you hear them screaming out your name?
Legends Never Die they become a part of you
Every time you bleed for reaching greatness 
Legends Never Die
