(Laugh) Dance
Back door, cracked we don’t need a key
We did it for free
No b after sleaze
Drink that cooly follow my lead
Now you’re one of us
You’re coming with me

It’s time to kill the lights and
Shut the DJ down
This place ‘s about to (blow)
Tonight we’re taken over
No one’s getting out !
This place’s about to blow – oh-oh-oh !!
Blow-oh-oh-ho
This place’s about to blow
X 3

Now we’re, what? Taking control
We get what we want
We do what you don’t
Dirt and glitter cover the floor
We’re pretty and sick
We’re young and we’re bored

It’s time to lose your mind
And let the crazy out
This place’s about to (blow)
Tonight we’re taking names
‘Cause we don’t mess around
This place’s about to blow –oh-oh-oh
Blow-oh-oh-ho
This place’s about to blow
X3

Go, go, go, go insane
Go insane
Throw some glitter
Make it rain on him
Let me see them Hanes
Let me, let me see them Hanes

Go insane
Go insane
Throw some glitter
Make it rain on him
Let me see them Hanes
Let me, let me see them Hanes (C'mon)

We are taking, over (Blow)
Get used to it, over (Blow)

This place about to blow
Blow
This place about to blow
Blow (Oh)
This place about to blow (Oh)
Blow
This place about to blow
Blow
This place about to
