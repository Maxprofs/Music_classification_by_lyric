                        Bài hát: Make Me Proud - Drake, Nicki Minaj

[Drake]
I like a woman with a future an a past
A little attitude prob all good it'll make the *** last
Don't make it too easy girl, don't take it too fast
Yeah, that's it, right there, that's it
Do it just like that
Only you could it just like that
And I love it when your hair's still wet
Cause you just took a shower
Running on a treadmill, an only eatin salad
Sound so smart, like you graduated college
Like you went to Yale, but you probably went to Howard knowin you,
Weekend in Miami, tryina study by the pool
Couple things do, but you always get it done
Mighta been a time when I loved her too
But you take that away, girl you always been the one
One, I wonder why the moon looks nice girl
Maybe it's just right for the night
You said nigga's comin on too strong girl
They want you in their life as a wife
That's why you wanna have no sex
Why you wanna protest, why you wanna fight for your right
Cause you don't love them boys, pushing run anything
*** that noise

[Hook]
I know things get hard
But girl you got it, girl you got it there you go
Can't you tell by how they lookin at you everywhere you go
Wonderin what's on your mind, it must be hard to be that fine, when all these mutha... wanna waste your time
It's just amazing, girl, and all I can say is...
I'm so, i'm so, i'm so, i'm so, i'm so
proud of you
I'm so, i'm so, i'm so, i'm so, i'm so
proud of you
I'm so, i'm so, i'm so, i'm so, i'm so
proud of you
Everything's adding up, you've been through hell and back
That's why you're bad as *** and you

[Nicki Minaj]
B-b-b-bet I am
All of them bitches I'm better then
Mansions in Malibu babblin
But I never mention everything I dabble in
And I always ride slow when I'm straddlin'
And my ***'s so wet you gotta paddle in
Gotta ro-ro-row, gotta row ya boat
It's Pink Friday records and OVO
Done did the pop tour, I'm the realest deal, best legal team so the deals is ill
It's Mac, OPI and a fragrance too
Apparal, I'm dominating every avenue
Cobble stone, good view, lil gravel too
Gotta pay for the entourage travel too
Cause I'm fli-fli-flying high
Aint got time to talk, just Hi and bye bitch
But baby you can ask me to take a break
I'll give it all away, don't care what the people say
I'll be a million, billion, trillion miles away
He asked my sign, I said a Sagg'
I'm a star, Sheriff badge,
Whats the point? If I'm guarded
Double D up hoes, Dolly Parton

[Drake]

It's just amazing, girl, and all I can say is...
I'm so, i'm so, i'm so, i'm so, i'm so
proud of you
I'm so, i'm so, i'm so, i'm so, i'm so
proud of you
I'm so, i'm so, i'm so, i'm so, i'm so
proud of you
Everything's adding up, you've been through hell and back
That's why you're bad as *** and you know you are
I'm so, i'm so, i'm so, i'm so, i'm so
proud of you
I'm so, i'm so, i'm so, i'm so, i'm so
