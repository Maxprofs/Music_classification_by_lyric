                        Bài hát: AutoTune - Jason Chen

I was young lost stupid didn't know what I was doing wrong
just eat sleep feeling free then I'd party all night long
but I would never get too worried
about the little things in life
I knew I won the lottery 
Cause baby can't you see

[Hook]
Just thinking about you as I sing this song
cause when you're around I can do no wrong
And I'm never too sharp, never flat
girl imagine that
You always know how to bring me right back
when my pitch is off
you make it all right when its all so wrong
You're my auto tune, you can be my auto tune

[Verse 2]
Now I've found my way girl ever since you came along
as I listen to the radio, bumping to our catchy song
you mean more than a grammy
and all the money in the world
every time that I get off key girl
continue to save me

[Hook x3]
