                        Bài Hát: Forever - Hòa Tấu

I'm standing alone in the darkness
The winter of my life came so fast
Memories go back to childhood
Todays I still recall.

Oh how happy I was then
There was no sorrow, there was no pain
Walking through the green fields
Sun shine in my eyes.

I'm still there every where
I'm the dust in the wind
I'm the star in the northern sky
I never stay anywhere
I'm the wind in the trees
Would wait for me forever?

Would you wait for me forever?
Will you wait for me forever?
                        
                    |
