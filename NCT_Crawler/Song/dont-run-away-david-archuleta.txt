                        When something’s wrong
And too much to handle
Try to find some peace of mind
Let it go.
Wait a minute, you know this road
It’s gonna leave you on overload

Yeah...

‘Cause somebody cares, yeah

I can see you hurting (turn around)
I will be right there
Don’t run away (x3)
When I reach out to you, look around
I will be right here
Don’t run away (x3)
Tonight

Hmm...


Don’t make a sound
I’ll be your voice
You don’t need to be afraid
Anymore
I’ll shine a light out in the dark
Guide you here no matter how far

Ooooohhh, yeah

‘Cause somebody cares, oh yeah

I can see you hurting, (turn around)
I will be right there
Don’t run away (x3)
When I reach out to you, look around
I will be right here
Don’t run away (x3)
Tonight

Open up
Let it all out tonight, yeah
Open up
And everything will be alright

I can see you hurting, (turn around)
I will be right there
Don’t run away (x3)
When I reach out to you, look around
I will be right here
Don’t run away (x3)

(Layered vocals of these words)
Oh, away, away, away, away, away
Don’t run away
Oooh, yeah

Tonight
                        
                    |
