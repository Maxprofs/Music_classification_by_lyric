                        The spell that you cast
 Seems to be wearing off fast
 (The spell that you cast)
 Come back baby, cos I don't know if I can last
 (The spell that you cast)
 And I wonder whether
 You got some other kind of lover
 That you like to please
 Better than me
 I don't think I can take it
 How am I going break it?
 The Spell That You Cast The spell that you've woven
 Seems to be coming undone
 (The spell that you cast)
 Come back, Baby or at least tell me where you are going
 (The spell that you cast)
 'Cos you know quite well
 I'm not a jealous kind of feller
 But they look in your eyes
 And they're all hypnotized
 I'm going to miss you madly
 'Cos I love you sadly
 The Spell That You Cast Jimmy come quickly 'cos I feel quite sickly
 (The Spell That You Cast)
 You're like a gangster's Molly with a cannonade volley
 (The Spell That You Cast) I don't think I can take it
 How am I going break it?
 The Spell That You Cast
