                        She left me on friday and ruined my weekend
 She thinks we're still best friends she thinks we're still alright She's playing her mind games got into the fast lane
 Drove off to some bright lights To find out if all the places that shine are anything like mine no no She left me with no hope it's all gone up in smoke
 She didn't invite me rode off with a donkey To find out if all the places that shine are anything like mine
 To find out if all the style she's got s'gonna push her to the top She left me on friday and put me in limbo
 She's stolen my ego and now it's a no go go go go She left me with no hope it's all gone up in smoke she didn't invite me To find if all the places that shine are anything like mine
 To find out if all the style she's got s'gonna push her to the top
 To find out if all the fridays you choose are where you'll still lose She left me on friday and ruined my weekend
 She thinks we're still best friends she thinks we're still alright To find if all the places that shine are anything like mine
 To find out if all the fridays that come are gonna make you feel welcome
 To find out if all the style you've got s'gonna push you to the top
 To find out if all the fridays you'll choose are where you'll still lose
