                        Snap backs and Levi jeans,
 P.B.R. and burnt CDs
 Running for the grass on the hot concrete
 Still working on our summer feet Cheap gas and ready ice,
 Trunk music and headlight fights
 Dodging the smoke from a riverbank fire
 A pretty girl and a pickup line like
 "Hey what's your name, you know smoke follows beauty, baby" We stayed up all night long
 Made our drinks too strong
 Feeling ten feet tall
 Ropes swinging into the water
 In the middle of the night
 Like oh oh oh oh oh
 Breaking our boots in
 Stompin' on the ground we grew up on
 Yeah, we were raised on it (Raised on it)
 Worked hard and played on it
 We had it made on it
 We were born and raised on it Car wash at the custom tent
 Sticky quarters and pine tree scent
 The only sign that we ever got stuck
 Is the muddy chain in the back of the truck 5-1's with a 20 on top
 Three guard at the barber shop
 Duckin' from your ex at the 4-way stop
 Turn the music down when you're passing the cops We stayed up all night long
 Made our drinks too strong
 Feeling ten feet tall
 Ropes swinging into the water
 In the middle of the night
 Like oh oh oh oh oh
 Breaking our boots in
 Stompin' on the ground we grew up on
 Yeah, we were raised on it (Raised on it)
 Worked hard and played on it
 We had it made on it
 We were born and raised on it Mama's prayers and daddy's speech
 Front porch philosophies
 A little too young and dumb to see
 Just what it all meant to me We stayed up all night long
 Made our drinks too strong
 Feeling ten feet tall
 Ropes swinging into the water
 In the middle of the night
 Like oh oh oh oh oh
 Breaking our boots in
 Stompin' on the ground we grew up on
 Yeah, we were raised on it (Raised on it)
 Worked hard and played on it
 We had it made on it
 We were born and raised on it (Oh oh oh oh oh)
 (Oh oh oh oh oh) Hm yeah
 (Oh oh oh oh oh) When the sun started sinking
 (Oh oh oh oh oh) And they turned those open signs around
 (Oh oh oh oh oh) We thought we ran this town, running around just
 (Oh oh oh oh oh) Breaking hearts and curfews
 (Oh oh oh oh oh) Out in the yard with no shoes
 (Oh oh oh oh oh) Staying cool in neighbour the pool
 (Oh oh oh oh oh) Fireball headed for the parking lot
 (Oh oh oh oh oh) And no Saturday mornings when we sleep late
 (Oh oh oh oh oh) ATV and firebreaks, worn out jeans, Black Eyed Peas, bathrobes
 (Oh oh oh oh oh) And blue skies, I was born and raised on it
 (Oh oh oh oh oh) Might have misbehaved on it
 (Oh oh oh oh oh) Worked hard and played on it
 (Oh oh oh oh oh) We had it made
 (Oh oh oh oh oh)
