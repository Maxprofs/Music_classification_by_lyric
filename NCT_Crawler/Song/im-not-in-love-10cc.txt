                        Song: I'M Not In Love - 10cc

I'm not in love
So don't forget it It's just a silly phase 
I'm goin' through And just because 
I called you up don' t get me wrong
don't think You've got it made 

I'm not in love no no I'd like to see you
but then again that doesn't mean 
you mean that much to me
so if i call you don't make a fuss 
don't tell your friends about 
the two of us i'm not in love no no 

I keep your picture upon the wall
it hides a nasty stain that's lyin' there 
so don't you ask me to give it back
i know you know it doesn't mean 
that much to me i'm not in love no no 

ooh you wait a long time for me 
ooh you wait a long time
i'm not in love i'm not in love
                        
                    |
