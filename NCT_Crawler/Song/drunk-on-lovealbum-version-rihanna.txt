 I feel like I'm a hopeless romantic
 I can't help falling in love
 I fiend for love
 I want it, I crave it
 I just can't get enough

 [Hook:]
 Take me away
 I wear my heart on my sleeve
 Always let love take the lead
 I may be a little naive, yeah
 You know I'm drunk on love
 Drunk on love
 Nothing can sober me up
 It's all that I need, yeah

 [Rihanna]
 I've been let down
 But never been tainted
 So I stay thirsty for more
 No I won't hold back
 No drop is wasted
 I let love run it's course

 [Hook:]
 Take me away
 I wear my heart on my sleeve
 Always let love take the lead
 I may be a little naive, yeah

 You know I'm drunk on love
 Drunk on love
 Nothing can sober me up
 You know I'm drunk on love
 Drunk on love
 Nothing can sober me up
 It's all that I need

 [Bridge:]
 I'm so intoxicated
 I love the way you taste
 On my lips, when we kiss
 You got me so addicted
 So much I can't resist
 Falling into your arms

 [Hook:]
 Take me away
 I wear my heart on my sleeve
 Always let love take the lead
 I may be a little naive, yeah
 You know I'm drunk on love
 Drunk on love
 Nothing can sober me up
 You know I'm drunk on love
 Drunk on love
 Nothing can sober me up

 It's all that I need
 It's all that I need
 It's all that I need
