                        I'm the man in the box
 Buried in my ***
 Won't you come and save me
 Save me Feed my eyes, can you sew them shut?
 Jesus Christ, deny your maker
 He who tries, will be wasted
 Feed my eyes now you've sewn them shut I'm the dog who gets beat
 Shove my nose in ***
 Won't you come and save me
 Save me Feed my eyes, can you sew them shut?
 Jesus Christ, deny your maker
 He who tries, will be wasted
 Feed my eyes now you've sewn them shut Feed my eyes, can you sew them shut?
 Jesus Christ, deny your maker
 He who tries, will be wasted
 Feed my eyes now you've sewn them shut
