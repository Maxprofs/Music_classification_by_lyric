                        Song: Say You Will 
Singer: Mateo

Every time I think about this song
I begin to get lost
Then maybe all my life it falls
When I thought that I was above
Maybe I put too much in fame light
Is the luck of the draw
And this game got me knocked in the jaw
and Ive been looking for my chance
cause everything you see is not what it appears
You think that Hollywood is always smiles and cheers
But they dont know Im hungry when I reach the ..
That I aint on the list and that I snuck in here
Every music idol that has sang to me
Comes across that they ain't really what they seem 
I continue on this motor city dreams oh again.

Chorus:
Say you will just tell me what is real
Say you will, say you will.

Every time I hear the choir sing
I picture my life to be
Living larger than I couldnt believe
With the model chick close to me
But maybe all the things I should have focused on
Was the love of life 
She could do it without the cameras and lights
And Im just sayin maybe yeah
The one I wannna find a cure in holy love
The one that I could think shes in this club
And just when I thought I was finally growing up
Im falling for these girls they never fill me up
I wonder if my name in life will be enough
If I dont have no wonder I can share a trust 
Say you will, say you will.

Chorus:
Say you will just tell me what is real
Say you will, say you will.

Now Im sitting in my room
Distant from the world 
Listening to my heart
Watching the smoke twirl
Step outside to myself look it life is a whole
The past, the future is uncertain
And nobody knows 
Im just tryin to unclog my dome
Dont call my phone right now I need to be alone
But all I can see is camera flicking my girl cant stand nigga
Im gone she's gone almost two months alone
My head spinning Im lost, phone ringing Im broke
Saving up for a car, is this a life of a star
Over wasting my time am I winning or losing
As for me as for you, is about business or music 
I swear the *** is confusing.
