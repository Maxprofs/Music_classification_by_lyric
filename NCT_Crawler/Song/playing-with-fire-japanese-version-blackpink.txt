                        Bài hát: Playing With Fire (Japanese Version) - BlackPink

[Verse 1: Jennie, Jisoo]
Mama ni itsumo iwarete ta no
Otoko ni wa kiwotsukete
Koi wa hiasobi mi tai de
Kega suru kara ne
Mama wa itsumo tadashikatta
Kimi to au tabi atsuku naru nda
Kowa sa yori hikareru kimi ni
Kogarete

[Pre-Hook: Rosé, Lisa]
Furueru koi
Kokoro wa On and on and on
Kimi ni sasage tai watashi no subetewo
Look at me look at me now
Kimi no sei da, yakedo shi chau
Kese nai

[Hook: Rosé, Jennie, Lisa]
Kono koi wa buljangnan
My love is on fire, ooh
Now burn baby burn
Buljangnan
My love is on fire
So don’t play with me boy
Buljangnan

[Verse 2: Lisa]
Oh no Ima sara hikikaesenaino
Mohaya tannaru asobi jyanaino
Got me fired up I'm burning
I don't even want it, can't stop it's urgent
I ain't never had nobody do it better
But oh no you're bad, really bad but...
BOY I'M LOCO!
Show 'em out, smoke 'em out, match scratch lighter
Kiss him, will I *** him I don't know but I miss him
Flame in my veins this love is like crack
Can you feel my heart go black?

[Pre-Hook: Jennie, Jisoo]
Furueru koi
Kokoro wa On and on and on
Mabushii honō no uzu ni ochitai no
(Jisoo) Look at me look at me now
Kimi no sei dayo, yakedo shi chau
Kese nai

[Hook: Rosé, Jennie, Lisa]
Kono koi wa buljangnan
My love is on fire, ooh
Now burn baby burn
Buljangnan
My love is on fire
So don’t play with me boy
Buljangnan
