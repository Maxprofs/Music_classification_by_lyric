                        Song: 4 In The Morning - Gwen Stefani

Wakin' up to find another day
The moon got lost again last night
But now the sun has finally had its say
I guess I feel alright

But it hurts when I think
When I let it sink in, its all over me
Im lyin' here in the dark
I'm watchin' you sleep, it hurts a lot

And all I know is
Youve got to give me everything
Nothing less 'cause
You know I give you all of me

I give you everything that I am
Im handin over everything that Ive got
'Cause I wanna have a really true love
Dont ever wanna have to go and give you up

Stay up till four in the mornin' and the tears are pourin'
And I want to make it worth the fight
What have we been doin' for all this time?
Baby, if were gonna do it, come on do it right

All I wanted was to know Im safe
Dont want to lose the love Ive found
Remember when you said that you would change
Dont let me down

Its not fair how you are
I cant be complete, can you give me more?

And all I know is
Youve got to give me everything
Nothing less 'cause
You know I give you all of me

I give you everything that I am
Im handin' over everything that Ive got
'Cause I wanna have a really true love
Dont ever wanna have to go and give you up

Stay up till four in the mornin' and the tears are pourin'
And I want to make it worth the fight
What have we been doin' for all this time?
Baby if were gonna do it, come on do it right

Oh please, you know what I need
Save all your love up for me
We cant escape the love
Give me everything that you have

And all I know is
Youve got to give me everything
Nothing less 'cause
You know I give you all of me

I give you everything that I am
Im handin' over everything that Ive got
'Cause I wanna have a really true love
Dont ever wanna have to go and give you up

Stay up till four in the mornin' and the tears are pourin'
And I want to make it worth the fight
What have we been doin' for all this time?
Baby if were gonna do it, come on do it right

Give you all of me
Give you everything
Give you all of me
