                        Bài hát: Tonight Belongs To U! - Jeremih, Flo Rida

Wasn't looking forward to heal the scar
But today, I was riding on Lonely Boulevard
Wishing all wasn't lost and then there, there you came
Honestly, a star shooting through the scene
In the sky, that's where we are, and I'm tryna catch your beam
See them other girls, yeah they try, but they ain't fly like you

[Hook:]
Tonight belongs to you
Tonight belongs to you
And I'm so glad I found you
I'm so glad I found you

You're all by yourself and I came to help
I was down, wasn't right and you came from out of left
Made a storm up in Ibiza, oh, oh what a dream
I'll close my eyes babe, now I don't wanna go
I'mma stall cause if I'm dreaming I don't wanna wake up
Got it heated from the steam, full speed ride with you

[Hook:]
Tonight belongs to you
Tonight belongs to you
And I'm so glad I found you
I'm so glad I found you

[Flo Rida:]
Flo Rida, ayo Jeremih, lemme holla at lil mama right quick
I know who you are, you're a rider, girl on fire, ghetto superstar
And I can't deny you, girl your body so damn beautiful
Let me see you turn around like aye
Baby go on drop it to the ground like aye
Red lips, yellow bone, green light aye
I ain't stopping baby 'til I get that thing right
Worn down, feeling like I finally found that one one one one
Slow down, pull the trigger too fast I'll bust my gun gun gun gun
No conversation
Don't stop, break down and shake it
Them other girls really basic
You amazing, so glad I got you girl

[Hook:]
And I'm so glad I found you
I'm so glad I found you
