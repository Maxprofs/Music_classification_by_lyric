                        Chorus
 You brighten up the moon and stars at night
 You keep me seeing rainbows in the sky
 You bring new meaning to my life, now
 I believe in miracles baby I'm forever yours, yours

 VERSE 1
 Tender love's what you're giving me and
 You surpass all my fantasies and
 I keep thanking the Lord above for
 Blessing me with oh so much

 Cause I know how it feels to be
 Part of you boy
 Everday of my life's so abundant
 With joy
 And I honestly never thought love
 Could be real
 Until the angels guided you to me

 You brighten up the moon and stars at night
 You keep me seeing rainbows in the sky
 You bring new meaning to my life, now
 I believe in miracles baby I'm forever yours, yours

 VERSE 2
 Lying with you so natural
 I never knew this was possible
 And it finally feels like my life has begun
 Now that I can share it with someone

 You brighten up the moon and stars at night
 You keep me seeing rainbows in the sky
 You bring new meaning to my life, now
 I believe in miracles baby I'm forever yours, yours

 You brighten up the moon and stars at night
 You keep me seeing rainbows in the sky

 BRIDGE
 Baby our love will always persevere
 Anything you ever need,
 You know I'll be right here and
 You don't have to worry boy
 I won't betray your trust
 Because I'm so much in love
 Every time your lips meet mine
 It still feels like the first time
 And if you lost everything
 I'd keep on standing by your side
 And boy it seems like everyday
 I fall deeper in love
 Because I can't get enough

 Everything that you do's so amazing
 Everything that you do's so amazing
 Everything that you do's so amazing
 Everything that you do's so amazing to me
