                        Bài hát: Hikaru Nara - Nightcore

Ameagari no niji mo rin to saita hana mo irozuki afuredasu 
Akane-iro no sora aogu kimi ni ano hi koi ni ochita

A rainbow after rain, and a flower that bloomed with the cold, are abundantly changing colors. 
That day, I fell in love with you who looked up at the blazing red sky

Shunkan no DORAMACHIKKU FIRUMU no naka no hito-koma mo 
Kienai yo kokoro ni kizamu kara

That one instant in a scene of the dramatic film 
Won't disappear, because it's etched into my heart

Kimi da yo kimi nanda yo oshiete kureta 
Kurayami mo hikaru nara hoshizora ni naru 
Kanashimi wo egao ni mou kakusanai de 
Kirameku donna hoshi mo kimi wo terasu kara

It's you, you who taught me. 
If the darkness shines too, then it'll become a night of stars. 
Don't hide your sadness behind a laughing face anymore 
Because all the twinkling stars will shine on you

Nemuri mo wasurete mukaeta asahi ga yatara to tsukisasaru 
Teikiatsu hakobu zutsuu datte wasureru kimi ni aeba

I forgot to sleep, and the sun that came out to meet me pierced me so much 
If I see you, I even forget the headache that carries my foul mood

Seijaku wa ROMANTIKKU koucha ni toketa SHUGAA no you ni 
Zenshin ni meguru yo kimi no koe

This stillness is romantic, like sugar melting in black tea 
Your voice, it goes around my whole body

Kimi da yo kimi nanda yo egao wo kureta 
Namida mo hikaru nara ryuusei ni naru 
Kizutsuita sono te wo mou hanasanai de 
Negai wo kometa sora ni ashita ga kuru kara

It's you, you who gave me a smiling face 
If tears shine too, then it'll become a falling star 
Don't separate those injured hands anymore 
Because tomorrow will come to the sky filled with wishes

Michibiite kureta hikari wa kimi da yo 
Tsurarete boku mo hashiridashita 
Shiranu ma ni KUROSU shihajimeta 
Hora ima da koko de hikaru nara

The light that guided me is you 
I was drawn, and I broke into a run 
While unaware, we started to cross 
Hey, its now. If it shines here

Kimi da yo kimi nanda yo oshiete kureta kurayami wa owaru kara

It's you, you who taught me the darkness will end

Kimi da yo kimi nanda yo oshiete kureta 
Kurayami mo hikaru nara hoshizora ni naru 
Kanashimi wo egao ni mou kakusanai de 
Kirameku donna hoshi mo kimi wo terasu kara

It's you, you who taught me. 
If the darkness shines too, then it'll become a night of stars. 
Don't hide your sadness behind a laughing face anymore 
Because all the twinkling stars will shine on you

Kotae wa itsudemo Guuzen? Hitsuzen? 
Itsuka eranda michi koso unmei ni naru 
Nigirishimeta sono kibou mo fuan mo 
Kitto futari wo ugokasu hikari ni naru kara

Is the answer at any time by chance? Is it necessary? 
Some day the road that you choose will be your destiny 
The hope and the anxiety you grasped tightly 
Will surely move you and me, because it will become a light
                        
                    |
