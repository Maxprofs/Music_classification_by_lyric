                        [Wiz Khalifa]
Yea, Uh huh, you know what it is
Black and yellow [x4]
Yea, Uh huh, you know what it is
Black and yellow [x4]

[Chorus: Wiz Khalifa]
Yeah, uh huh, you know what it is
Everything I do, I do it big
Yeah, uh huh, screaming that’s nothing
What I pulled off the lot, that’s stunting
Repping my town when you see me you know everything
Black and yellow [x4]
I put it down from the whip to my diamonds, I’m in
Black and yellow [x4]

[Snoop Dogg]
Big Snoop Dogg and Wiz Khalifa
see on the West Coast I’m the big Chief-a
The grim reaper, maybe that bring me that, yellow lack
stealer logo in the back
we banging out, that taylor gang
dub to your face baby till ya say my name
dont get your clique served
so much Black and Yellow you would think I’m from Pittsburgh
Intern, get yearn

[Chorus]

[Juicy J]
I’ma bumble bee lit up like a crima tree
drinking Hennessy, I’m from Tennessee
Juicy J make their way on their own two
quarter mill for the Phantom, bitch I own you
and that go for every G that I’m f-cking with
Black and Yellow bitches all around me, yeah I did
in the he *, gotta get that reimbursed
on the pills and that purple pint of Surp
and I stay Louie down to the socks
Range, and watch, weed and glock
fiends to pop
my fans roll with them rubberband knots
I’m getting old but them rubber bands not n-gga

[Chorus]

[T-Pain]
Catch me in my Lamborghini
(Black and Yellow, black and yellow)
I can rock it on the beat or Accapella, accapella
sideways in the turning lane
fire flame I be burning man
Teddy Pain bout to hurt the game
took a break for a while I’ve been learning things
I learned how to tell a n-gga f-ck you then
(Black and Yellow, black and yellow)
All I do is f-cking win
I told y’all,
                        
                    |
