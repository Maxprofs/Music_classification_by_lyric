                        And I always find, yeah, I always find somethin' wrong
You been puttin' up wit' my * just way too long
I'm so gifted at findin' what I don't like the most
So I think it's time for us to have a toast

Let's have a toast for the douchebags,
Let's have a toast for the *s,
Let's have a toast for the scumbags,
Every one of them that I know
Let's have a toast to the jerkoffs
That'll never take work off
Baby, I got a plan
Run away fast as you can

She find pictures in my email
I sent this girl a picture of my, dick
I don't know what it is with females
But I'm not too good with that, *
See, I could have me a good girl
And still be addicted to them hoodrats
And I just blame everything on you
At least you know that's what I'm good at

See, I always find
And I always find
Yeah, I always find somethin' wrong
You been puttin' up with my * just way too long
I'm so gifted at findin' what I don't like the most
So I think it's time for us to have a toast

Let's have a toast for the douchebags,
Let's have a toast for the *s,
Let's have a toast for the scumbags,
Every one of them that I know
Let's have a toast to the jerkoffs
That'll never take work off
Baby, I got a plan
Run away fast as you can

Run away from me, baby
Run away
Run away from me, baby
Run away
Doesn't have to get crazy,
Why can't she just run away?
Baby I got a plan,
Run away as fast as you can
Run away from me, baby
Run away
Run away from me, baby
Run away
Doesn't have to get crazy,
Why can't she just, run away?
Baby I got a plan,
Run away as fast as you can

24/7, 365, pussey stays on my mind
I-I-I-I did it, all right, all right, I admit it
Now pick your next move, you could leave or live wit' it
Ichabod Crane with that mother *in' top off
Split and go where? Back to wearin' knockoffs, ha ha
Knock it off, Neiman's, shop it off
Let's talk over mai tais, waitress, top it off
Whoes like Hoechers wanna fly in your Freddy loafers
You can't blame 'em, they ain't never seen Versace sofas
Every bag, every blouse, every bracelet
Comes with a price tag, baby, face it
You should leave if you can't accept the basics
Plenty whoes in the baller-nigga's matrix
Invisibly set, the Rolex is faceless
I'm just young, rich, but your tasteless
P!

(Kanye)

Never was much of a romantic
I could never take the intimacy
But I know it did damage
Cuz the look in your eyes, it's killing me
I guess that gives you an advantage
Cuz you can blame me on every thing
And I don't know how imma manage
If one day you just up and leave


Yeah, I always find somethin' wrong
You been puttin' up with my * just way too long
I'm so gifted at findin' what I don't like the most
So I think it's time for us to have a toast

Let's have a toast for the douchebags,
Let's have a toast for the *s,
Let's have a toast for the scumbags,
Every one of them that I know
Let's have a toast to the jerkoffs
That'll never take work off
Baby, I got a plan
Run away fast as you can
