                        Bài hát: Windmill - Helloween

Time goes wherever you are, 
time is your guiding star
That shines all through your life,
makes you feel and move

My dreams are out in the far, 
so are yours apart
Of secret fairy tales, 
dripped on the wings of the
mystery mill

Windmill, windmill, keep on turning; 
show me the way, take me today
Windmill, windmill, hearts are yearning, 
longing for love and a chance to be free

Don't feel alone and depressed, 
someone will come at last
To soothe your stumbling mind,
to keep it away from the evil storm

Windmill, windmill, keep on turning; 
show me the way, take me today
Windmill, windmill, hearts are yearning, 
longing for love and a chance to be free
                        
                    |
