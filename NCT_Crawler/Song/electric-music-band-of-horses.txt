                        Listen to the motor getting louder as we go
 One way or another, gonna make it back home
 Mountains to the water chewing up the scenery
 Fog,it only hovers, or the blinding sun beams
 This is what he does traveling the open road Get her on the double, make it right away
 This is what he loves
 Traveling the open road Now she's talking dirty
 I get there in a hurry and see
 You don't have worry, a secret little birdie told me
 Keeping things in motion, baby keep on running for me
 Only static on the radio, pick up speed Hear me out mama, I don't mean for you to weep
 Get back to you tomorrow, now don't you lose sleep
 This is what he does traveling the open road Hey it's nine thirty
 My vision's getting blurry and weak
 I'd get there in a hurry but the police are following me
 Keep it in perspective, maybe come visit and free me
 K-9 unit on the interstate, Nashville, Tennessee Keep things in motion baby, keep on running for me
 Only static on the radio I'm picking up speed
