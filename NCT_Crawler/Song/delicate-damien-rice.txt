DELICATE
FROM 《LOST》

We might kiss when we are alone
When nobody’s watching
We might take it home
We might make out when nobody’s there
It’s not that we’re scared
It’s just that it’s delicate

So why do you fill my sorrow
With the words you’ve borrowed
From the only place you’ve know
And why do you sing Hallelujah
If it means nothing to ya
Why do you sing with me at all?

We might live like never before
When there’s nothing to give
Well how can we ask for more
We might make love in some sacred place
The look on your face is delicate

So why do you fill my sorrow
With the words you’ve borrowed
From the only place you’ve know
And why do you sing Hallelujah
If it means nothing to ya
Why do you sing with me at all?

So why do you fill my sorrow
With the words you’ve borrowed
From the only place you’ve know
And why do you sing Hallelujah
If it means nothing to ya
Why do you sing with me at all?
