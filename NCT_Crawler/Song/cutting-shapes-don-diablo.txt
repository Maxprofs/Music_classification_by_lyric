Dancin' is what to do
Dancin's when I think of you
Dancin's what clears my soul
Dancin's what makes me whole

Dancin' is what to do
Dancin's when I think of you
Dancin's what clears my soul
Dancin's what makes me whole

Dancing, dancing, dancing
Dancin' is what to do
All the time, oh baby, all the time
Dancing, dancing, dancing

Dancin' is what to do
Dancin's when I think of you
Dancin's what clears my soul
Dancin's what makes me whole

Dancin' is what to do
Dancin's when I think of you
Dancin's what clears my soul
Dancin's what makes me whole

Dancing, dancing, dancing
Dancin' is what to do
Dancin's when I think of you
Dancin's what clears my soul
Dancin's what makes me whole

Dancin' is what to do, what to do, do do do
Dancin' is what to do
All the time, oh baby, all the time
Dancing, dancing, dancing
