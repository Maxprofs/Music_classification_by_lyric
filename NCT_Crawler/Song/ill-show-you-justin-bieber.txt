                        Bài hát: I'll Show You - Justin Bieber

My life is a movie
And everyone's watchin'
So let's get to the good part
And past all the nonsense

Sometimes it's hard to do the right thing
When the pressure's coming down like lightning
It's like they want me to be perfect
When they don't even know that I'm hurting

This life's not easy
I'm not made out of steel
Don't forget that I'm human
Don't forget that I'm real
You act like you know me
But you never will
But that's one thing that I know for sure

I'll show you
I'll show you
I'll show you
I'll show you

I got to learn things, learn them the hard way
To see what it feels like, no matter what they say

Sometimes it's hard to do the right thing
When the pressure's coming down like lightning
It's like they want me to be perfect
When they don't even know that I'm hurting

This life's not easy, I'm not made out of steel
Don't forget that I'm human, don't forget that I'm real
You act like you know me, but you never will
But that's one thing that I know for sure
I'll show you
I'll show you
I'll show you
I'll show you
This life's not easy, I'm not made out of steel
Don't forget that I'm human, don't forget that I'm real
You act like you know me, but you never will
But that's one thing that I know for sure

I'll show you
I'll show you
I'll show you
I'll show you...
