                        Bài hát: You Let Me Walk Alone - Michael Schulte

[Verse 1]
I'm a dreamer, a make believer
I was told that you were too
I love the silence and the clear horizon
And I got that all from you

[Pre-chorus]
Every now and then I'm drawn to places
Where I hear your voice or see your face, and
Every little thought will lead me right back to you

[Chorus]
I was born from one love of two hearts
We were three kids and a loving mum
You made this place a home
A shelter from the storm
You said I had one life and a true heart
I tried my best and I came so far
But you will never know
'Cause you let me walk this road alone

[Verse 2]
My childhood hero will always be you
And no one else comes close
I thought you'd lead me when life's misleading
That's when I miss you most

[Pre-chorus]
Every now and then I'm drawn to places
Where I hear your voice or see your face, and
Every little thought will lead me right back to you

[Chorus]
I was born from one love of two hearts
We were three kids and a loving mum
You made this place a home
A shelter from the storm
You said I had one life and a true heart
I tried my best and I came so far
But you will never know
'Cause you let me walk this road alone

[Bridge]
Ohhhh, ohhhh, ohhhh

[Chorus]
I was born from one love of two hearts
We were three kids and a loving mum
You made this place a home
A shelter from the storm
You said I had one life and a true heart
I tried my best and I came so far
But you will never know
'Cause you let me walk this road alone
                        
                    |
