                        Bài hát : How Proud - Chloe Howl

You make me smile when you said you're over here
 You make me good when you're into her
 So don't bother showing me those lines
 That are tattooed on your lips
 I've seen you on your stage before
 I've memorized the script
 Oh, you're picture perfect
 Oh, you're picture perfect
 You're two-dimensional
 How proud are you of yourself?
 Who do you think you're fooling?
 Not me, and you think that you're back in
 I know you better than you do
 How proud are you of yourself?
 Who do you think you're fooling?
 Not me, and you think that you're back in
 I know you better than you do I miss my time with you never around
 I miss the things you say when you don't make a sound
 So don't bother showing me those lines that are tattooed on your lips
 I know you're on the clock for sure,
 I know the way you tick
 Oh, you're picture perfect
 Oh, you're picture perfect
 You're two-dimensiona
 How proud are you of yourself?
 Who do you think you're fooling?
 Not me, and you think that you're back in
 I know you better than you do
 How proud are you of yourself?
 Who do you think you're fooling?
 Not me, and you think that you're back in
 I know you better than you do
 So I won't be second best
 We didn't grow old in love for you
 You're way out of your depth
 Cause I know your every move
 So I won't be second best
 We didn't grow old in love for you
 You're way out of your depth
 Cause I know your every move
 How proud are you of yourself?
 Who do you think you're fooling?
 Not me, and you think that you're back in
 I know you better than you do
 How proud are you of yourself?
 Who do you think you're fooling?
 Not me, and you think that you're back in 
How proud are you of yourself?
 Who do you think you're fooling?
 Not me, and you think that you're back in
 I know you better than you do
 How proud are you of yourself?
 Who do you think you're fooling?
 Not me, and you think that you're back in
