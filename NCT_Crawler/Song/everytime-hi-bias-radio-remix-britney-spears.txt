notice me
take my hand
why are we
Strangers when
Our love is strong
Why carry on without me?
And everytime I try to fly
I fall without my wings
I feel so small
I guess I need you baby
And everytime I see you in my dreams
I see your face, it's haunting me
I guess I need you baby
I make believe
That you are here
It's the only way
I see clear
What have I done
You seem to move on easy
And everytime I try to fly
I fall without my wings
I feel so small
I guess I need you baby
And everytime I see you in my dreams
I see your face, you haunting me
I guess I need you baby
I may have made it rain
Please forgive me
My weakness caused you pain

And song is my soon face
Everytime I try to fly
I fall without my wings
I feel so small
I guess I need you baby
And everytime I see you in my dreams
I see your face,you haunt me
I guess I need you baby
Everytime I try to fly
I fall without my wings
I feel so small
And song is my soon face
And song is my soon face
