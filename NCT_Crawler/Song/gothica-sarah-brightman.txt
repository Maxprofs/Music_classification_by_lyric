Hello again
Why so old
Wasn't time your friend
I must be told
Hello again
It seems so long
Since we last met
How has it gone
Don't accept the blame
I would
I would not complain

Cause I'm sure it wasn't your own fault
That you never made it out your fall
Just lock the door and find some time to scream
To scream again

Just say when
And you'll stop the pain
Of your life
Bring it to an end
Just say when
And you can make amends
Just say hello
Say hello again

Hello again
It's not that hard
No dead ends
Even with the scares
Don't accept the blame
I would
I would not complain

Cause I'm sure it wasn't your own fault
That you never made it out your fall
Just lock the door
Find some time to scream

Just say when
And you'll stop the pain
Of your life
Bring it to end
Just say when
And you could make amends
Just say hello
Say hello again

You have no home
You've lost your throne
Where has it gone
Well, it could come back
But you're being there
By the walking dead
Stumble as you crack the ground
You'll be down

Just say when
You could stop the pain

Just say when
And you could make amends
Just say hello
Say hello again
(Hello again)
(Hello again)
(Hello again)
(Hello again)
It's not the end if you just say hello again...

The End
                        
                    |
