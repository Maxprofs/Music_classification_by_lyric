                        Bài hát: Hey Angel - One Direction

Hey angel...
Do you know the reasons why?
We look up to the sky?
Hey angel...
Do you look at us and laugh
When we hold on to the past?
Hey angel...

Oh I wish I could be more like you
Do you wish you could be more like me?
Oh I wish I could be more like you
Do you wish you could be more like me?

Hey angel
Tell me, do you ever try
To come to the other side?
Hey angel
Tell me, do you ever cry
When we waste away our lives?
                        
                    |
