                        You held my hand and then you slipped away
 And I may never see your face again
 So tell me how to fill the emptiness inside
 Without love, what is life? And anyone who knew us both can see
 We always were the better part of me
 I never wanted to be this free
 And all this pain, when does it go away? Then every time I turn around
 And you're nowhere to be found
 I know I gotta long, long way to go
 Before I can say goodbye to you
 Oh, I gotta long, long way I know
 Before I can say goodbye
 To all I ever knew, to you
 To you From memory there is no hiding place
 Turn on the TV and I see you there
 In every crowd there's always someone with your face
 Everywhere, trying not to care Then every time I turn around
 And you're nowhere to be found
 I know I gotta long, long way to go
 Before I can say goodbye to you
 Oh, I gotta long, long way I know
 Before I can say goodbye
 To all I ever knew To you I wish you everything
 And all the best that life can bring
 I only hope you think of me sometimes Oh, and even though I feel the pain
 I know that I will love again
 The time will come
 Oh, and I'll move on I gotta long, long way to go
 Before I can say goodbye to you
 Oh, I gotta long, long way I know
 Gotta long way to go Before I can say goodbye
 Before I say goodbye
 To all I ever knew
 To all I ever knew I gotta long long way to go
 Before I can say goodbye
 Say goodbye, say goodbye I gotta long, long way to go
 Before I can say goodbye to you
 But I wish you the best girl
 To all I ever knew
 Oh and all of the rest to you
