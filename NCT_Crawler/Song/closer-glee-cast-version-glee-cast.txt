                        All I want to get is a little bit closer
All I want to know is can you come a little closer
Here comes the breath before we get a little bit closer
Here comes the rush before we touch, come a little bit closer
The lights are off and the sun is finally setting
The night sky is changing over head
It’s not just all physical.
So let’s make things physical
I won’t treat you like you’re typical
I’m the type, who won’t get oh so critical
I won’t treat you like you’re typical
All you think of lately is getting underneath me
All I dream of lately is how to get you underneath me
Here come the heat before we meat , a little bit closer
Here come the sparks before the dark , come alittle closer
The light are off and the sun is finally setting.
The night sky is changing over head
It’s not just all physical.
So let’s make things physical
I won’t treat you're like you’re typical.
I want you close, I want you
I won’t treat you like you’re typical
I want you close, I want you 
I won’t treat you like you’re typical
Here come the dreams of you and me
Here come the dreams
Here come the dreams of you and me
Here come the dreams
It’s not just all physical
I won’t treat you like you’re oh so typical
So let’s make things physical
I won’t treat you like you’re typical
I want you close, I want you
I won’t treat you like you’re typical
I won’t treat you like you’re typical
I won’t treat you like you’re typical
All I want to get is a little bit closer
All I want to know is can you come a little closer
