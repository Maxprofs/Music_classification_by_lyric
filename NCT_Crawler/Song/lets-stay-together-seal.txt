                        Bài hát: Let's Stay Together - Seal

I
I'm so in love with you
Whatever you want to do
Is alright with me
You make me feel so in you
And I wanna spend my whole life with you
Let the senses
Since we're been together
Loving you forever
Is what I need yeah

Let me be the one who come harder to
'cause I'll never be a true
Ooh

[Chorus:]
Let's, let's stay together
Loving you whether whether
Times are good or bad, happy or sad

Uuh uuh yeah yeah
When times are good or bad
Happy or sad
And why somebody tell me
Why do people break up?
You turn around and make up
I just can't see
Ooh and you never do that to me, now would you baby
Being around you is all I see
That's what I wanna do

[3x Chorus:]
Let's, let's stay together
Loving you whether whether
Times are good or bad, happy or sad
                        
                    |
