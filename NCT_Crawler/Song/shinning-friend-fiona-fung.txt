                        A little faith 
Brightens a rainy day Life is difficult you can go away 
Don't hide yourself in a corner 
You have my place to stay 

Sorrow is gonna say goodbye 
Opens up You'll see the happy sunshine 
Keep going on with your dream Chasing tomorrow sunrise 
The spirit can never die 

Sun will shine, my friend 
Won't let you cry, my dear 
Seeing you shed a tear, make my world disappear 
You'll never be alone in darkness 
See my smile, my friend 
We are with you, holding hands 
you have got to believe, you are my destiny 
We're meant to be your friends 
That's what a friend should be
                        
                    |
