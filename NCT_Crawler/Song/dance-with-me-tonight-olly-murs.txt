                        Song: Dance With Me Tonight - Olly Murs

Ladies and Gentlemen we've got a special treat for you tonight,
I'm gonna call my friend Olly up here to sing to you ladies,
Olly!
Let's go man,

My name is Olly, nice to meet you, can I tell you baby,
Look around there's a whole lot of pretty ladies,
But none like you, you shine so bright, yeah.

I was wondering if you and me could spend a minute,
On the floor up and close getting lost in it,
I won't give up without a fight.

I just wanna, ooh, oh baby,
I just want you to dance with me tonight,
So come on, ooh, oh baby,
I just want you to dance with me tonight.

We're getting sweaty, hot and heavy in the crowd now,
Loosen up and let your hands go down, town

Go with it girl, yeah just close your eyes, yeah.

I feel the music moving through your body,
Looking at you I can tell you want me,
Don't stop keep going till the morning light, yeah.

When I saw you there,
Sitting all alone in the dark acting like you didn't have a care,
I knew right then, that you'd be mine, and we'd be dancing the whole damn night right,
Ooh, oh baby, I just want you to dance with me tonight,
So come on, ooh, oh baby,
I just want you to dance with me tonight.

Break it down now, shake it like that, now bring it all back,
To dance with me tonight,
One more time, one more time, come on now.
Do your thing, everybody sing,
I just want you to dance with me tonight, yeah
I just wanna, ooh, oh baby,
I just want you to dance with me tonight
Ooh, just close your eyes, we can dance all through the night
I just want you to dance with me tonight,
And everybody sing, girl just close your eyes
We can dance all through the night
I just want you to dance with me tonight
So come on, just close your eyes, ooohhh
We can dance all through the night
I just want you to dance with me tonight
