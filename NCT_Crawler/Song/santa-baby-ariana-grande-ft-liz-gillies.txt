                        Santa baby, slip a sable under the tree
 For me I've been an awful good girl
 Santa baby, and hurry down the chimney tonight Santa Baby, a fifty-four convertible too, light blue
 I'll wait up for you dear
 Santa baby, and hurry down the chimney tonight Think of all the fun I've missed
 Think of all the fellas that I haven't kissed
 Next year I could be just as good
 If you'd check off my Christmas list Santa baby, I wanna yacht and really that's not a lie
 I've been an angel all year
 Santa Baby, and hurry down the chimney tonight Santa honey, the one thing that I really do need, the deed
 To a platinum mine
 Santa honey, so hurry down the chimney tonight Come and trim my Christmas tree
 With some decorations bought at Tiffany's
 I really do believe in you
 Let's see if you believe in me Santa baby, forgot to mention one little thing, a ring
 But I don't mean other phone
 Santa baby, and hurry down the chimney tonight So hurry down the chimney tonight
 (Waiting, hurry)
 (Tonight)
 Hurry down the chimney tonight
