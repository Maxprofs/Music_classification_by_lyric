 Dance wit me, baby baby dance wit me
 Dance wit me, baby baby dance wit me
 Dance wit me, baby baby dance wit me If you feel like dancing all night long
 Band goin' strike it up and play you a party song
 If what you feel is real then we gon' get down and groove
 I love the way you party, I love the way you move Dance wit me, baby baby dance wit me

 We got the groove and you know that it's here to stay
 So if you feel like dancin' put on your dancin' shoes

 Dance wit me, baby baby dance wit me
 Dance wit me, baby baby dance wit me
 Dance wit me, baby baby dance wit me If you feel like dancing all night long
 Band goin' strike it up and play you a party song
 If what you feel is real we gon' get down and groove
 Love the way you party, I love the way you move Dance wit me, baby baby dance wit me
 Dance wit me, baby baby dance wit me
 Dance wit me, baby baby dance wit me
 Dance wit me, baby baby dance wit me
