                        Bài hát: Bad (Remix 2014) - DJ TDJ, David Guetta, Showtek, Vassy

I say why does it feel so good?
So good to be bad
Getting what I want, boy
Why does that make you so mad?

You see, why does it feel so good?
So good to be bad
'Cause if it's trouble that you're looking for
Oh baby, here I am

Oh baby, here I am

So why does it feel so good?
So good to be bad

Bad

I say why does it feel so good?
So good to be bad
Getting what I want, boy
Why does that make you so mad?

You see, why does it feel so good?
So good to be bad
'Cause if it's trouble that you're looking for
Oh baby, here I am

Oh baby, here I am
Bad
