                        Hey baby girl, looking all grown up
I wanna know where did you come from
The heat begin to ..I warm up
And we’re about to go in plane...
Let’s party hard, and just move something
The vibe is right and it goes, goes, goes on like you

Chorus:
Such a beautiful crowd...
We’re standing on chairs with our hands up in the air
Girls getting real loud
They’re blowing in the wind
We’re standing on chair with the hands up in the air
with the hands up in the air
with the hands up in the air
with the hands up in the air
with the hands up in the air

If you’re standing on them soft couch cushions
Careful not to break your concentration
Mainta in sexy as she maintains balance
Balance, if you fall, baby girl it won’t be cute at all
Drinking, you look me roughly in the eye
Only comes dancing, holding on...
Plus you’re the music, plus you’re the light,
...equals one hell of a night, and now I’m talking about

Chorus:
Such a beautiful crowd...
We’re standing on chairs with our hands up in the air

Girls getting real loud
They’re blowing in the wind
We’re standing on chair with the hands up in the air
with the hands up in the air
with the hands up in the air
with the hands up in the air
with the hands up in the air

I got my eyes closed
Jumping up and down, baby I’m...
I got my eyes closed
Listen to the sounds so hypnotizing
And I bet before the night in
I won’t find one...
Take her home, get it the next morning
Baby girl, give me that one more... before you go!
I got my eyes closed (baby I got my)
I got my eyes closed (baby I got my)
I got my eyes closed (baby I got my)

Chorus:
Such a beautiful crowd...
We’re standing on chairs with our hands up in the air
Girls getting real loud
They’re blowing in the wind
We’re standing on chair with the hands up in the air
with the hands up in the air
with the hands up in the air
with the hands up in the air
with the hands up in the air
                        
                    |
