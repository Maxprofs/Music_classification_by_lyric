Pills and potions
We're overdosing
I’m angry but I still love you
Pills and potions
We're overdosing
Can't stand it, but I still love you
I still love, I still love
I still love, I still love
I still love, I still love
I still love, I still love
I still love, I still love

Hey yo, they could never make me hate you
Even you what you was doing wasn’t tasteful
Even though you our here looking so ungrateful
I’mma keep it moving, be classy and graceful
I told ‘em miss no friends in the game
You ain’t learned that yet
All the bridges you came over, don’t burn that yet
Niggas want respect, but niggas ain’t earned that yet
Self-righteous, and untitled
But they swear it on a bible that they love you
When they really they’re no different from all your rivals
But I still don’t wish death on them, I just reflect on them

Pills and potions
We're overdosing
I’m angry but I still love you
Pills and potions
We're overdosing
Can't stand it, but I still love you
I still love, I still love
I still love, I still love
I still love, I still love
I still love, I still love
I still love, I still love




Yo, people will love you and support when it’s beneficial
I’mma forgive, I won’t forgive but I’mma dead the issue
Soon as you out the nigga's lifes is when they start to miss you
They see you doing good now it's kinda hard to *** you
They guess be sick when they remember all the bad they wished you
They guess be mad when they can’t come and live lavish with you
But I sped off in a Bency, I see the envy when I’m causing a frenzy
So I pop pills for them, cop cribs in the Hills for them

Pills and potions
We're overdosing
I’m angry but I still love you
Pills and potions
We're overdosing
Can't stand it, but I still love you
I still love, I still love
I still love, I still love
I still love, I still love
I still love, I still love
I still love, I still love

I get high off your memory
I get high off your memory
I get high off your memory
And your time will be fine
And you time...

I still love, I still love
I still love, I still love
I still love, I still love
I still love, I still love
I still love, I still love
