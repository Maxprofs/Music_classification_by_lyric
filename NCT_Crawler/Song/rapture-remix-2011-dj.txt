                        The night I laid my eyes on you
felt everything around me move
Got nervous when you looked my way
But you knew all the words to say

Then your love slowly moved right in
All this time oh my love where you been

Mi amore don't you know
My love I want you so
Sugar you make my soul complete
Rapture tastes so sweet

Mi amore don't you know
My love I want you so
Sugar you make my soul complete
Rapture tastes so sweet

Since we connect behind closed doors
Spark this fire even more
No telling where we will be next
Surrender to your rapture arrest
Lay your head, let the slumber float
Can't resist, that's why words were wrote

Mi amore don't you know
My love I want you so
Sugar you make my soul complete
Rapture tastes so sweet
                        
                    |
