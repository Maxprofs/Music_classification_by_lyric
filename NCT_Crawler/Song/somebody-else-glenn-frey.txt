                        Girl, I brought you a little present to celebrate tonight
 And let you know everything's gonna be alright
 In spite of all the love I'm feeling
 I know there's something you're concealing
 I was hoping you would ease my worried mind If there's somebody else, you should let me know
 If there's somebody else, better let him go
 If there's somebody else, you can set him free
 Tell that somebody else, you belong to me
 You belong to me Listen, I know every secret you've been keeping
 Who you're going with and where you're sleeping
 And I'm telling you, you got to stop it now
 Hope you're listening to what I'm saying
 This is not a silly game we're playing
 It's the one and only thing I can't allow If there's somebody else, you should set him free
 If there's somebody else, then it's history
 If he knew how it was, then he'd let you go
 If there's somebody else, you should let him know How could you think that I would not see?
 It shows that you got no respect for me
 If there's somebody else, you got one more chance
 If there's somebody else, it's a dead romance I don't really wanna say goodbye
 Oh, it would break my heart, if I should see you cry
 You know you can't go on denying who I am
 And darlin' that is why there can be no other man If there's somebody else, then let me know
 If there's somebody else, you better let him go
 If there's somebody else, you can set him free
 Tell that somebody else, you belong to me If there's somebody else, somebody else
 If there's somebody else, somebody else
 Somebody, somebody, can't help thinking there's
 Somebody, somebody
 I know there's somebody, somebody, somebody
