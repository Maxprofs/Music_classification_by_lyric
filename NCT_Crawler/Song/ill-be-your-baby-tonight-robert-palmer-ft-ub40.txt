                        Close your eyes, close the door
 You don't have to worry any more
 I'll be your baby tonight Shut the light, shut the shade
 You don't have to be afraid
 I'll be your baby tonight Well, the mockingbird's gonna sail away
 We're gonna forget it
 Big old moon's gonna shine like a spoon
 We're gonna let it, you won't regret it Kick your shoes off do not fear
 Bring that bottle over here
 I'll be your baby tonight Be my baby, be my baby
 Be my baby, be my baby
 I'll be your baby tonight Well, the mockingbird's gonna sail away
 We're gonna forget it
 Big old moon's gonna shine like a spoon
 We're gonna let it, you won't regret it Kick your shoes off, do not fear
 Bring that bottle over here
 I'll be your baby tonight Be my baby, be my baby
 Be my baby, be my baby
 I'll be your baby tonight I'll be your baby tonight
 I'll be your baby tonight
