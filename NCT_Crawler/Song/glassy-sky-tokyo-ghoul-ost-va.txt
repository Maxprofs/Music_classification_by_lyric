                        Bài hát: Glassy Sky (Tokyo Ghoul OST) - V.A

How many days have passed like this? 
This city the crowd is fading, moving on
I sometimes have wondered where you've gone 
Story carries on, lonely, lost inside

I had this dream so many times 
The moments we spent has past and gone away 
Could there be an end to this, what I'm feeling deep inside 
You know there's no looking back

[Chorus] 
Glassy sky above, as long as I'm alive, you will be a part of me 
Glassy sky, the cold, the broken pieces of me

The mystery of it I recall 
Suddenly the truth will change the way we fall 
I didn't wanna hurt you, hope you know 
Empty promises, shattered dreams of love 

Sometimes I wonder what's beyond 
I tried many times to make it up to you 
Can somebody tell me what to do? 
Thought we're meant to be there's no going back

Time has already come
Sun is gone and no more shadows
Can't give up I know and this life goes on 
I'll be strong I'll be strong 'til I see the end

[Chorus] 
Glassy sky above, as long as I survive, you will be part of me 
Glassy sky, the cold, the broken pieces of me 
Glassy sky above, covers over me over me
                        
                    |
