                        Sun going up making its rounds
 It keeps on moving, painting the town
 Before you know it, she's sinking low So tell me something
 Something I don't already know
 I don't know Towards the south, then turning north
 Whirlwind spinning on a circular course
 The answer, my friend returns to blow So, tell me something
 Something I don't already know
 I don't know
 Tell me something I don't know As for the wise men who pursue their knowledge
 Same as the fool, same as the fool, free falling prey to folly
 Can only one fate, one fate befall them both? So tell me something
 Something I don't already know
 I don't know Tell me something I don't know
 Tell me something I don't know
 Ah, can you tell me? It must go on, as for the show
 So tell me something Something I don't already know
 I don't know
 Tell me something I don't know
 Tell me something I don't know Tell me, tell me, tell me, tell me
 Tell me, tell me, tell me, tell me
 Tell me, tell me, tell me, tell me
 Tell me, tell me, tell me, tell me
