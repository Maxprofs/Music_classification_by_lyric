Ca sĩ: Minh Thư

Baby, I'm wondering
Is it real feeling when you touch me
Far away when I'm come home
is it real feeling when I miss you?
I'll fly to the sky above,
through the clouds and the shinning stars
Just try to find our stars,'cause she can answer me

Don't go away, when I'm still here
Cause my feeling keeps wondering
If someday I can be sure that my feeling is real
So come to me and take me to the sky
We will find our stars together
Then keep them there 4ever and ever

So come to me and take me to the sky
We will find our stars together
Then keep them there 4ever and ever

I'll fly to the sky above,
through the clouds and the shinning stars
Just try to find our stars,'cause she can answer me

Don't go away, when I'm still here
Cause my feeling keeps wondering
If someday I can be sure that my feeling is real
So come to me and take me to the sky
We will find our stars together
Then keep them there forever and ever.
