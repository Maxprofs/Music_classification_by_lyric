                        Bài hát: I Will Follow Him - Guitar

Love him, I love him, I love him
And where he goes I'll follow
I'll follow, I'll follow
I will follow him
Follow him wherever he may go
There isn't ocean too deep
A mountain so high it can't keep me away
I must follow him
Follow him
Ever since he touched my hand I knew
That near him I always must be 
And nothing can keep him from me 
He is my destiny
Destiny
I love him, I love him, I love him
And where he goes I'll follow
He'll always be my true love 
My true love, my true love 
From now until forever, forever, forever
Follow him
I know I'll always love him, I love him ,I love him
I'll follow, I'll follow...fade
A mountain so high it can keep, keep me away
Away from my love
