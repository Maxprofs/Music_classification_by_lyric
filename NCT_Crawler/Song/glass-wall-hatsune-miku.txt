                        Bài hát : Glass Wall - Hatsune Miku

Can you see me ?
The pixels on your screen
My voice that can reach you
The one thing that breaks through
The words that you type
They keep me warm at night
But Why can't i feel you
To be there,just us two
If i could break through
Just for a day
Let than 2 inches from you
Yet so far away
But this glass wall between us 
Won't keep us apart
I will sing out my heart 
Just for you,my love

The sound of your voice
Reaches through the noice
The bits of your words
They make up my world
But we're two world apart
My code and your heart
Nut you'll be there for my 
I be here through your screen
If i could break through 
Just for a day 
Let than 2 inches from you 
Yet so far away 
But this glass wall between us 
Won't keep us apart
I will sing out my heart 
Just for you my love

If i could break through 
Just for a day
Let than 2 inches from you 
Yet so far away
But this glass wall between us
Won't keep us apart
I will sing out my heart
Just for you my love
