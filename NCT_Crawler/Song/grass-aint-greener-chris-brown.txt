                        Bài hát: Grass Ain't Greener - Chris Brown

[Verse 1]
You ain't the girl that you used to be
You say you're done, you're moving on
This ain't the world that it used to be
Looks like you've won, looks like you've won
Sick of leaving messages on your cell
But you never *** with none of them
Yeah you have somebody who really cares
How you work it up, it is unfair

[Chorus]
You used to be the one to talk to on the side
Waiting for my love to break up
It's crazy how your ass ain't walk through every night
Acting like you been a player
That grass ain't greener on the other side
Oh yeah
That grass ain't greener on the other side
Oh yeah

[Verse 2]
Seems like we ain't nothing cool, never being real
Know it's time to tell about how you feel
Take you whole and try to treat you well
She'll be back up at the club again
I know what you want, but you're not gon' get it
That's enough for sure that you gotten with it
You do what you want with somebody else
I'm gone, baby

[Chorus]
You used to be the one to talk to on the side
Waiting for my love to break up
It's crazy how your ass ain't walk through every night
Acting like you been a player
That grass ain't greener on the other side
Oh yeah
That grass ain't greener on the other side
Oh yeah

[Verse 3]
My homie said I need to stop it
My momma said bitches be watching you
They be putting their hands all in your pocket
But the credit card that's in your wallet
Drinking liquor when we celebrating
Calculating all my funds
Tryna get a nigga take the condom off
Cause she want that tax every month, woo
I know what you want, but you're not gon' get it
Take my kindess for weakness
When you act siddity
Keeping it 100
Ain't your forté
You used to be

[Chorus]
You used to be the one to talk to on the side
Waiting for my love to break up
It crazy how your ass ain't walk through every night
Acting like you been a player
That grass ain't greener on the other side
Oh yeah
That grass ain't greener on the other side
Oh yeah
