                        Song: One More Time - Kenny G, Chant√© Moore

I lie half awake, late at night
I reach out to touch you
feel you by my side
and I reach, and I reach,
but I never get to feel you
Will I ever get to feel you again, again

Just one more time
One more moment
To take you in my arms
One more chance
One more kiss
Before I wake to find you gone
One more time
Before I have to face another bad day,
and my heart breaks again

It's only a dream
but it's all so real
Don't want it to end
but I know it will
So I pray, and I pray
Every night I'm on my knees
Begging for the chance to see you
again, again

Just one more time
One more moment
To take you in my arms
One more chance
One more kiss
Before I wake to find you gone
One more time
Before I have to face another bad day,
and my heart breaks again
