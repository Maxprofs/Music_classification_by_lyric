                        Someone falls to pieces, sleeping all alone
 Someone kills the pain, spinning in the silence
 To finally drift away Someone gets excited
 In a chapel yard and catches a bouquet
 Another lays a dozen, white roses on a grave Yeah and to be yourself is all that you can do
 Hey, to be yourself is all that you can do Someone finds salvation in everyone, another only pain
 Someone tries to hide himself, down inside himself he prays
 Someone swears his true love until the end of time
 Another runs away, separate or united, healthy or insane And to be yourself is all that you can do, yeah
 (All that you can do)
 To be yourself is all that you can do
 (All that you can do) To be yourself is all that you can do
 (All that you can do)
 Hey, be yourself is all that you can do Even when you've paid enough
 Been pulled apart or been held up
 Every single memory of the good or bad
 Faces of luck Don't lose any sleep tonight
 I'm sure everything will end up alright
 You may win or lose But to be yourself is all that you can do, yeah
 To be yourself is all that you can do Oh, to be yourself is all that you can do
 (All that you can do)
 Hey, to be yourself is all that you can do
 (All that you can do) To be yourself is all that you can
 Be yourself is all that you can
 Be yourself is all that you can do
