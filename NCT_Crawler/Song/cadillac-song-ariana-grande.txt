[Chorus]
Riding 'round in my Cadillac
Thinking 'bout the day that I first saw you
Nothing compares to what we had, and baby that won't change
I want you babe, I still want you baby, I still want you

[Verse 1]
Summer days with my honey
Worried 'bout nothing
Back in the day when things were easier than a breeze
Who knew that kiss was the last one?
I never thought we would change
Baby, I'm missing you

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, we shoulda been forever but we fell apart
Might have separated but you took my heart
Always knew I wasn't really over us
Sometimes I catch myself

[Chorus]
Riding 'round in my Cadillac
Thinking 'bout the day that I first saw you
Nothing compares to what we had, and baby that won't change
I want you babe, I still want you baby, I still want you

[Verse 2]
Memories last forever, so how could I just forget?
Made everything from nothing cause time was all we spent

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, we shoulda been forever but we fell apart
Might have separated but you took my heart
Always knew I wasn't really over us
Sometimes I catch myself

[Chorus]
Riding 'round in my Cadillac
Thinking 'bout the day that I first saw you
Nothing compares to what we had, and baby that won't change
I want you babe, I still want you baby, I still want you
                        
                    |
