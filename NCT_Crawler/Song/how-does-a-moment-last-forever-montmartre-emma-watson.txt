                        Bài hát: How Does A Moment Last Forever (Montmartre) - Emma Watson

This is the Paris of my childhood
This is the borders of my life
And this crumpling, dusty attic
Where an artist loved his wife
Easy to remember, harder to move on
Knowing the Paris of my childhood is gone
                        
                    |
