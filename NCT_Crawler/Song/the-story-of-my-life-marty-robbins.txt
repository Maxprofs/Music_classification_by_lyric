                        Bài hát: The Story Of My Life - Marty Robbins

Someday I'm gonna write the story of my life
 I'll tell about the night we met and how my heart can't forget
 The way you smiled at me I want the world to know the story of my life
 The moment when your lips met mine and that first exciting time
 I held you close to me The sorrow when our love was breaking up
 The memory of a broken heart
 Then later on the joy of making up
 Never, never more to part There's a one thing left to do before my story's through
 I've got to take you for my wife so the story of my life
 Can start and end with you The sorrow when our love was breaking up
 The memory of a broken heart
 Then later on the joy of making up
 Never, never more to part There's a one thing left to do before my story's through
 I've got to take you for my wife so the story of my life
 Can start and end, can start and end, can start and end with you
