                        Bài hát: All I Ever Need - Austin Mahone

Don't the water grow the trees
Don't the moon pull the tide
Don't the stars light the sky
Like you need to light my life
If you need me anytime
You know i'm aways right by your side
You see i've never lelt this love
You're the only thing that's on my mind
You don't understand how much you really mean to me
I need you in my life
You're my necessity
But believe me you're everything that just makes my world complete
My love is clear the only thing that i'll ever see

You're i ever need
Baby you're amazing
You're my angel come and save me
Ohh (x2)

Don't the water grow the trees
Don't the moon pull the tide
Don't the stars light the sky
Like you need to light my life
We can do anything in life
I know we both can get it right tonight
You got your walls built up high
I can tell by looking in your eyes 
You don't understand how much you really mean to me
I need you in my life
You're my necessity
But believe me you're everything that just makes my world complete
My love is clear the only thing that i'll ever see

You're i ever need
Baby you're amazing
You're my angel come and save me
Ohh (x2)

When it comes to you, baby i'm addicted
You're like a drug, no rehab can fix it 
I think you're perfect baby even with you flaws 
You ask what i like about you
Ooh, i love it all

You're i ever need
Baby you're amazing
You're my angel come and save me
Ohh (x2)
