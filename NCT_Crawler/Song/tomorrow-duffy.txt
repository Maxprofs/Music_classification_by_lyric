                        I, I
Get this creepin feelin'
That you, you might
N start believin'
That we
We aren't meant to be
So tell me
Will you always love me

[Chorus:]
Tomorrow
Will bring me sorrow
Say you
Say you love me
But will
Your change your mind
But
Tomorrow
Will you bring me sorrow
Say you
Say you love me
But will
You change your mind
Woooh

I, I
Get this strange rejection
Every time
I look in your direction
Tell me am I
Just imagining it
Oohh
Tell me
Will the pieces still fit

Tomorrow
Will you bring me sorrow
Say you
Say you love me
But will
You change your mind
Tomorrow
Will you bring me sorrow
Say you
Say you love me
Woooh

I pray it's in my mind
I pray
I'm reading you wrong
I know these answers
Are hard to find
Please tell me
I'm wrong

Tomorrow
Will you bring me sorrow
Say you
Say you love me
Will you change your mind
Tomorrow
Will you bring me sorrow
Say you
Say you love me
Wooh

I, I, I
But
Tomorrow
Will you bring me sorrow
Say you
Say you love me
But will
You change your mind
Woooh
                        
                    |
