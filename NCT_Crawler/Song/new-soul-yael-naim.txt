                        I’m a new soul I came to this strange world 
Hoping I could learn a bit about how to give and take. 
But since I came here 
Felt the joy and the fear 
Finding myself making every possible mistake 

La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la 
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la 

I’m a young soul in this very strange world 
Hoping I could learn a bit about what is true and fake. 
But why all this hate? 
Try to communicate. 
Finding trust and love is not always easy to make. 

La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la 
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la 
Uhhhhh 

This is a happy end cause’ you don’t understand 
Everything you have done 
why’s everything so wrong 

This is a happy end come and give me your hand 
I’ll take your far away. 

I’m a new soul I came to this strange world 
Hoping I could learn a bit about how to give and take 
But since I came here fellt the joy 
And the fear finding 
Myself making every possible mistake 

La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la... 
(new soul) 
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la... 
(possible mistake)
