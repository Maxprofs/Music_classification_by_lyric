                        Until the oceans all run dry
Until the stars fall from the sky
Even if words don't seem to rhyme
I'll be addicted to your smile

And if the wind blows out the sun
I'll still believe you are the one
No matter what we're going through
I'll plan to spend my night with you

I promise you, my heart won't fade
I swear to you, my soul always
It isn't hard to understand
You're making me a better man

Baby, my love will say it all
I'll always catch you when you fall
And if the hard times get too much
I'll still be craving for your touch

I promise you, my heart won't fade
I swear to you, my soul always
It isn't hard to understand
You're making me a better man

I dedicate my world
I dedicate my all
For every moment
You're leaving me breathless

I dedicate my touch
Forever's not enough
I wanna hold on
I just wanna hold on to you

I promise you, my heart won't fade
I swear to you, my soul always
Ooh, it isn't hard to understand
You're making me a better man
It isn't hard to understand
You're making me a better man
