                        Bài hát: Birthday - JP Cooper

I'll be at something
At something bubbling
You was a fun thing
Ain't nothing troubling
I had the spring in my step
Like walking on trampolines
These days I'm looking back
But there's no sense in that
Searching for somebody new
Who can move me like you is a hopeless task
'Cause I got these chains on my feet
And everybody I'll be

Ain't got nothing on you
If it was my birthday
I'd be opening presents
And hoping to have it from you
'Cause you always make it better
Baby I ain't got nothing on you
If it was my birthday
I'd be blowing out candles
And wishing for someone like you
One dance no "you's"

Nothing is possible
Now that I'm on my own
And if I don't do it for you
Then I just don't know how to do anything
Heads under water again
But I ain't no submarine
Trying to come up again
Heading now with my friends
But I got this chains on my feet
And everybody I meet

Ain't got nothing on you
If it was my birthday
I'd be opening presents
And hoping to have it from you
'Cause you always make it better
Baby I ain't got nothing on you
If it was my birthday
I'd be blowing out candles
And wishing for someone like you
One dance no "you's"

Never knew how to say
What I feel for you
You say it's too late
You don't feel the fire
You don't hear when I say
There's nobody
They ain't got nothing on you
If it was my birthday
I'd be opening presents
And hoping to heaven for you
'Cause you always make it better

Baby I ain't got nothing on you
If it was my birthday
I'd be opening presents
And hoping to have it from you
'Cause you always make it better
Baby I ain't got nothing on you
If it was my birthday
I'd be blowing out candles
And wishing for someone like you
One dance no "you's"
