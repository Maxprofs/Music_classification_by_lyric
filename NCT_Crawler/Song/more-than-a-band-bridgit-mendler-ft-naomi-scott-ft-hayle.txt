                        I can't pretend to know how you feel
 But know that I'm here know that I'm real
 Say what you want or don't talk at all
 Not gonna let you fall Reach for my hand cuz it's held out for you
 My shoulders are small but you can cry on them too
 Everything changes but only one thing is true
 Understand, we'll always be more than a band oh (yeah) x4 You used to brave the world all on your own
 Now we won't let you go were going along
 Be who you wanna be always stand tall
 Not gonna let you fall Reach for my hand cuz it's held out for you
 My shoulders are strong but you can cry on them too
 Everything changes but one thing is true
 Understand, we'll always be more than a band I never knew you could take me so far
 I've always wanted the home that you are
 The ones i need Reach for my hand cuz it's held out for you
 My shoulders are stronq but you can cry on them too
 Everything changes but one thing is true
 Understand, we'll always be more than a band Reach for my hand cuz it's held out for you
 My shoulders are strong but you can cry on them too
 Everything changes but only one thing is true
 Understand, we'll always be more than a band
