                        Hey there little baby won't you try your rise? 
You tell me what I wanna know 
You said your talent's ten,baby pushed around 
You hitting down to Mexico 

Tell me do you still in that same bikini 
That you worn in sixty-five 
You know that one more of those than other bands 
The one that make me feel alive 

If your daddy ask where've been you are 
What am I supposed to do? 
You just tell him the whole world pass me by 
I ain't got nothing left to prove 

I've been to fly fly fly away 
If our love is strong 
We would never go wrong 
Coz that's the place to be 
Baby bye bye bye baby 
If you ever come down 
We're still from around 
Watch the sunset to the sea 

Has that little black bird sit on the roof 
Where did my baby go 
You said something's life have thrown you off track 
The way we ain't got never know 

If your daddy ask where've been you are 
What am I supposed to say? 
You are telling em the whole world's passed me by 
Could I live my life my own way 

I've been to fly fly fly away 
If our love is strong 
We would never go wrong 
Coz that's the place to be 
Baby bye bye bye baby 
If you ever come down 
We're still from around 
Watch the sunset to the sea 

You've seen the pictures 
Are we dancing all night long 
You dress in that you used to be 
Long long gown 

So baby you fly fly fly away 
If our love is strong 
We would never go wrong 
Coz that's the place to be 
Baby bye bye bye baby 
If you ever come down 
We're still from around 
Watch the sunset to the sea 
Fly fly fly away 
If our love is strong 
We would never go wrong 
Coz that's the place to be 
Baby bye bye bye baby 
If you ever come down 
We're still from around 
Watch the sunset to the sea 

Watch the sunset to the sea
                        
                    |
