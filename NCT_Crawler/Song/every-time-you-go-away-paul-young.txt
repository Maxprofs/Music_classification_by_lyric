                        Bài hát: Every Time You Go Away - Paul Young

( PAUL YOUNG ) 

Hey, if we can solve any problem 
Why do we lose so many tears 
Oh, so you go again 
When the leading man appears 

Always the same thing 
Can't you see 
We've got everything goin' on and on and on 

Every time you go away 
You take a piece of me with you 
Every time you go away 
You take a piece of me with you 

Go on and go free, yeah 
Maybe you're too close to see 
I can feel your body move 
It doesn't mean that much to me 

I can't go on sayin' the same thing 
Just can't you see 
We've got everything, do you even know we know 

Every time you go away 
You take a piece of me with you, oh 
Every time you go away 
You take a piece of me with you 

I can't go on sayin' the same thing 
'Cause baby, can't you see 
We've got everything goin' on and on and on 

Every time you go away 
You take a piece of me with you 
Every time you go away 
You take a piece of me with you 

Every time you go away 
You take a piece of me with you 
Every time you go away 
You take a piece of me with you 

Every time you go away 
You take a piece of me with you 
Every time you go away 
You take a piece of me with you
                        
                    |
