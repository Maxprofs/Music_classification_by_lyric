                        Song: Where The Hell Are My Friends - Lany

Where the hell are my friends
Home alone, not again
Friday, wine, and the internet
The only love I seem to get

And I don't, and I don't, 
and I don't know why
I don't have anyone on a weekend night
Where the hell are my friends
Where the hell are my friends

Am I starting to hate California
Why am I in L.A
40 million in California
No one cares if I stay

Am I starting to hate California
Why am I in L.A
40 million in California
But god, I'm so in love with this place

Where the hell are my friends
Out without me again
Friday, wine, and the internet
A life I wish I could forget

And I don't, and I don't, 
and I don't know why
I don't have anyone on a weekend night
Where the hell are my friends
Do I have any friends

Am I starting to hate California
Why am I in L.A
40 million in California
No one cares if I stay

Am I starting to hate California
Why am I in L.A
40 million in California
But god, I'm so in love 
with this place

Am I starting to hate California
40 million in California

Am I starting to hate California
Why am I in L.A
40 million in California
But god, I'm so in love 
with this place

And I don't, and I don't, 
and I don't know why
I don't have anyone on a weekend night
Where the hell are my friends
Where the hell are my friends
