Said he tried to phone me
But I never have time
He said that I never listen
But I don’t even try

I got a new place in Cali
But I’m gone every night
So I fill it with strangers
So they keep on the lights

She said she told you she knows me
But the face isn’t right
She asked if I recognized her
And I told her I might

See, everywhere I go
I got a million different people tryna kick it
But I’m still alone in my mind, yeah

I know you’re dying to meet me
But I can just tell you this
Baby, as soon as you meet me
You’ll wish that you never did
(you’ll wish that you never did)

Uuh, look, I’m a ra-rare individual
I’m in the physical and the metaphysical
I know you need your alone time, that’s critical
But I need some of your time, is that hypocritical

Damn, you know I relate to you more than fam
So I won’t sit around and let you sink in quick sand
Look, I know you got million dollar plans
And you tryna build a brand
Living life in high demand

Swerving Big B’s your bag got little G’s
Gicci down to the socks like Biggie and Little Ceas’
Lets hit the Maldive and hide behind palm trees
Little red wine, weed and a calm breeze

‘Cause baby you been living life inside a bubble
When the last time you had somebody hug you
Hold up, when the last time you had somebody love you
Hold up, when the last time you love someone who love you

You know that everywhere I go
I got a million different people tryna kick it
But I’m still alone in my mind

I know you’re dying to meet me
But I can just tell you this
Baby, as soon as you meet me
You’ll wish that you never did
(You’ll wish that you never did)

Stay up and have me all night on the rack
You know we say me have the wickedest talk
You always tell me, tell me pull the attitude
And you don’t like my friend ’cause she rude

Still I pu-pull up in the Benz with the who got ting
Window down ’cause you have to see me with my king
What ya’ sippin’ boy I’m dipping now ya’ trippin’ off a fling
I be clipping off your wing

See, everywhere I go
I got a million different people tryna hit it
But I’m still alone in my mind

I know you’re dying to meet me
But I can just tell you this
Baby, as soon as you meet me
You’ll wish that you never did
(You’ll wish that you never did)
Yeah-ee, yeah-ee

You’ll wish that you never did
You’ll wish that you never did
