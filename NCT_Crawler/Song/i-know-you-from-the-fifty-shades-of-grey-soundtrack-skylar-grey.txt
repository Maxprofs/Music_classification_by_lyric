                        Bài hát: I Know You (From The “Fifty Shades Of Grey” Soundtrack) - Skylar Grey

I believe, I believe there's love in you
Gridlocked on the dusty avenues,
Inside your heart, just afraid to go
I am more, I am more then innocent
But just take a chance and let me in
And I'll show you ways that you don't know

Don't complicate it,
Don't let the past dictate
Yeaaah,
I have been patience, but slowly I'm losing faith

So please, I know you baby
I know you baby
So please, I know you baby
I know you baby

I believe, I believe you could love me
But you're lost on a road to misery
And what I gave to you
I can never get back
Don't complicate it,
Don't drive yourself insane
Yeaaah,
Say what you will but I know that you want to stay!

So please, I know you baby
I know you baby
So please, I know you baby
I know you baby

Chemicals rushing in,
I know that it's you that I belong to
I'm burning like a cannonball in the air
Crushing into who I belong to
Uuuh uh, uuuuh uuuuh uh

I have been patience, but slowly I'm losing faith
Please, I know you baby
I know you baby
So please, I know you baby
I know you baby
Please, I know you baby
I know you baby
So please, I know you baby
I know you baby
(The shadows of your heart
Are hanging in the sweet, sweet air
I know you baby,
The secrets that you hide, control us and it's just not fair
I know you baby)
