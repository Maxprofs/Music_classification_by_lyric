                        Ey ey ey
Ey ey ey... 

Sometimes when you talk, 
I don't hear a thing, 
Don't take it wrong.
I look at your face, 
And bells start to ring, 
Then my mind's gone.

If I was a fire, 
You would make me burn, 
Heyyyy, eyyyy, hey

It doesn't take much for you
To break down my gravity.
You got my heart stuck, 
Stuck on a cloud, 
And I can't speak.

But if I was a book, 
You'd be every word.
Heyyyy, eyyyy, eyy

Twenty-five hours every day, 
I got nothing else better to do, 
Than watching the smile light your face, 
It doesn't get better than you.
All that we need
Is a starlit sky
And you and me.
Oh oh oh oh oh
It's true, 
I got nothing else better to do.

Ey ey ey
Ey ey ey

An island of green
And blueberry eyes, 
Wish we were there.
But you make me feel I'm in paradise, 
Anywhere.

If I was a song, 
You would make me sing, 
Heyyyy, eyyyy, eyy
Yeahhh

Twenty-five hours every day, 
I got nothing else better to do, 
Than watching the smile light your face, 
It doesn't get better than you.
All that we need
Is a starlit sky
And you and me.
Oh oh oh oh oh
It's true, 
There's nothing else better... 

You're velvet on a red cupcake, 
Sound a cello & a violin make.
Oohh, 
Oohhh

You put the rings around the moon, 
And every single time I'm close to you, 
Whoooa, 
Eyyyyy

Twenty-five hours every day, 
Eyy-heyyy, 
Watching the smile light your face, 
Yeahhh yeahh, 

Twenty-five hours every day, 
I got nothing else better to do, 
Than watching the smile light your face, 
It doesn't get better than you.
All that we need
Is a starlit sky
And you and me.
Oh oh oh oh oh
It's true, 
I got nothing else better to do.

(Oh oh oh)
Ey ey ey ey ey ey
Got nothin' else better to do
(Oh oh oh)
Ey ey ey ey ey ey
I got nothin' else better to do
There's nothin' else better (better)
Better to do...
