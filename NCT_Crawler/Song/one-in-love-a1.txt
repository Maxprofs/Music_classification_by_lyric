                        Bài hát: One In Love - A1

Have you seen your suset
Fade beneath a raincloud
Have you ever chased your dreams away
Did you ever think that
Life was just a highway
A never ending road of lonely days

There are times we cry
And reach out to the sky
For the strenght we need
To hold our head up high

CHORUS
All we have to do now
To love one another
Sisters and brothers
Can all live as one
And all we have to do noe
Is show one another
We all need each other
To love as one in lone

Have you seen a sunrise
Promising you daylight
When all you need to shelter from the storm
Have you ever fely that
Love was just an island
You cant survive on love on your own

There are times when I
Need to reach inside
For the strenght I need
To hold my head up high

(Repeat Chorus)

If we push aside the blame
For the tears and the pain
You know love can reign
And the world will smile again

(Reapeat Chorus2x)
