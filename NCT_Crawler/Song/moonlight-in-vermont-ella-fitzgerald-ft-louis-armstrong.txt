                        Pennies in a stream
 Falling leaves of a sycamore
 Moonlight in Vermont Icey finger waves
 Ski trails on a mountain side
 Snowlight in Vermont Telegraph cables, they sing down the highway
 And travel each bend in the road
 People who meet, in this romantic setting
 Are so hypnotized by the lovely Evening summer breeze
 Warbling of a meadowlark
 Moonlight in Vermont Telegraph cables, they sing down the highway
 And travel each bend in the road People who meet, in this romantic setting
 Are so hypnotized by the lovely Evening summer breeze
 Warbling of a meadowlark
 Moonlight in Vermont You and I and moonlight in Vermont Moonlight in Vermont
