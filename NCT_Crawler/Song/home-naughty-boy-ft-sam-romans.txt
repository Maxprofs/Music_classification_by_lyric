                        Red door ends the driveway on the street where we met
 I take a thousand memories on the road with me
 So we never forget
 It's been a good year, will be a long day
 Before we lay our heads down to rest
 And if those tears come rolling down
 I'll pull you close to me
 And tell you we'll be back there again Won't be a long time, time
 Won't be a long time
 Won't be a long time, time
 Won't be a long time Till we get back home
 Till we get back home
 Till we get back home
 Till we get back home
 Till we get back home
 Till we get back home We've had good times, it's been real love
 And I know it's hard to move on
 But don't place your sentimens in the things we left
 It's when we're together, we're home Won't be a long time, time
 Won't be a long time
 Won't be a long time, time
 Won't be a long time Won't be a long time, time
 Won't be a long time
 Won't be a long time Till we get back home
 Till we get back home
 Till we get back home
 Till we get back home
 Till we get back home
 Till we get back home
