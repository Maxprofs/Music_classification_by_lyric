                        Oh yeahhhhhh yeahhhhhhh
Oh oh oh oh oh uh

[Verse 1:]
I keep watching you
Everything you do
Every night I pray
That you may walk on my way
If I see your face, such a lovely face
I’m thinking about the way how to say
Come on with me

[Bridge 2:]
My heart is aching
I just can’t wait no more
When I see the way
You’re moving cross the dancefloor
There’s no mistaking
I want you more and more
Every second of my life

We gotta get together right now
We gotta get together right now
We gotta get together right now
Cause we can not escape our faith

[Chorus:]
If I can have you for the rest of my life
Oh baby my body’s turning cold as ice
Nothing I could do
If I’m losing you
It’s getting just as cold as ice
Cold as ice

Each time you leave
it’s like I’m shiver inside
Oh baby my body’s turning cold as ice
Nothing I could do
If I’m losing you
It’s getting just as cold as ice
Cold as ice
Cold as ice

[Verse 2:]
This is gonna be an emergency
Can’t you see the snow
And the ice all around me
You know that i freeze
Come into me
It takes you warm and lips
And your kiss
You defrost me

[Bridge 2:]
The ice is breaking
When you walk you through the door
You know how to keep me rocking on the dancefloor
Temperature is rising
Incrising more and more
It’s getting hot in here tonight

We gotta get together right now
We gotta get together right now
We gotta get together right now
We gotta get together right now
We gotta get together right now
Cause we can not escape our faith

[Chorus:]
If I can have you for the rest of my life
Oh baby my body’s turning cold as ice
Nothing I could do
If I’m losing you
It’s getting just as cold as ice
Cold as ice

Each time you leave
it’s like I’m shiver inside
Oh baby my body’s turning cold as ice
Nothing I could do
If I’m losing you
It’s getting just as cold as ice
Cold as ice
Cold as ice

[C-Part:]
I-C-E
That’s what I’m gonna be
If you’re not here with me
Than someday somebody
Will find me frozen

[Chorus:]
If I can have you for the rest of my life
Oh baby my body’s turning cold as ice
Nothing I could do
If I’m losing you
It’s getting just as cold as ice
Cold as ice

Each time you leave
It’s like I’m shiver inside
Oh baby my body’s turning cold as ice
Nothing I could do
If I’m losing you
It’s getting just as cold as ice
Cold as ice
Cold as ice

Cold as ice, ohhhh uhhh, cold as ice
                        
                    |
