                        Who knows the day when we would fall apart?
Standing in the rain, with my broken heart,
I'd still feel your lips in my memories
Nothing would fade...

It'd be a lie to say I ain't worried
That I'd lose you when I love you the most
For love is so vague, for our hands are weak
Oh baby, don't you know?

I would love you more than words that I can say
I would trade all my life to be with you
When the night falls slowly, I'd be lost without you
Oh what else could I do?

Baby don't let go, because I love you so
For the rest of my life, my only love
When you feel so lonely, oh baby don't you cry?
Don't you know I love you?

Baby take my hand, until the very end
To the heaven or hell, with you I stand
Where our love can grow old,
Where there are just us two
Where I can be with you
Don't you know, I love you?
                        
                    |
