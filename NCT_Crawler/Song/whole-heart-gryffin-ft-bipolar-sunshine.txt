                        Bài hát: Whole Heart - Gryffin, Bipolar Sunshine

We got problems in the streets again
Drowning in the violence, it's getting pretty tense
A lot of hunger in the faces I see
A lot of bitterness, communal emptiness
Don't trust the water, friend
Chemicals hide with the skeletons
Don't trust that false pretense
Counterfeit lies are your best defense
I said, you've got to, got to, got to go whole heart
Yeah, darling, darling, darling, go whole heart
You've got to, got to, got to go whole heart
Yeah, darling, darling, darling, go whole heart
We got issues that we can't change
As quickly as we'd like to, as we need to
And I'm worried it will back spin
Pulling out the lynch pin, leaving us victims
Don't trust the water, friend
Chemicals hide with the skeletons
Don't trust that false pretense
Counterfeit lies are your best defense
I said, you've got to, got to, got to go whole heart
Yeah, darling, darling, darling, go whole heart
You've got to, got to, got to go whole heart
Yeah, darling, darling, darling, go whole heart
I said, you've got to, got to, got to go whole heart
Yeah, darling, darling, darling, go
Head first, past the point of no return
It's the only way left to go
Can't keep taking while the years go by
Gotta go whole heart this time
You gotta go whole heart
You gotta go whole heart this time
I said, you've got to, got to, got to go whole heart
Yeah, darling, darling, darling, go whole heart
You've got to, got to, got to go whole heart
Yeah, darling, darling, darling, go
I said, you've got to, got to, got to go whole heart
Yeah, darling, darling, darling, go whole heart
