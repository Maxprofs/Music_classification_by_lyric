                        Lying in your arms, so close together, 
Didn't know just what I had. 
Now I toss and turn, cause I'm without you, 
How I'm missing you so bad. 
Where was my head? 
Where was my heart? 
Now I cry alone in the dark. 

CHORUS: 
I lie awake I drive myself crazy, 
Drive myself crazy, thinking of you. 
Made a mistake when I let you go baby. 
I drive myself crazy 
Wanting you the way that I do. (Wanting you the way that I do) 

I was such a fool, I couldn't see it. 
Just how good you were to me 
You confessed your love, and dying devotion. 
I confessed my need to be free. 
And now I'm left with all this pain, 
I've only got my self to blame. 

Chorus 

Why didn't I know how much I loved you baby? 
Why didn't I show it? If only I showed it baby 
Oh I had a chance! 
Oh I had a chance! 

La La La La La La La La La La La La 

I Drive myself Crazy Ohhhhhhhh 
Oh so crazy La La La La 
Oh Oh Oh Oh... 

I lie awake I drive myself crazy, 
Drive myself crazy, thinkin' of you 
Made a mistake when I let you go baby 
I drive myself crazy 
Wanting you the way that I do 
I drive myself (CRAZY,CRAZY,CRAZY,YEAH) 
Made a mistake when I let you go baby I drive myself crazy, 
Wanting you the way that I do, 
Wanting you the way that I do. 
Drive myself Crazy wanting you the way that I do
                        
                    |
