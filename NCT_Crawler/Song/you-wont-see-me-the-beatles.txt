                        When I call you up
Your line's engaged
I have had enough
So act your age
We have lost the time
That was so hard to find
And I will lose my mind
If you won't see me
(You won't see me)
You won't see me
(You won't see me)

I don't know why you (Ooh-ooh)
(La la-la)
Should want to hide (Ooh-ooh)
(La la-la)
But I can't get through (Ooh-ooh)
(La la-la)
My hands are tied (Ooh-ooh)
(La la-la)
I won't want to stay (Ooh-ooh)
(La la-la)
I don't have much to say (Ooh-ooh)
(La la-la)
But I'd get turned away (Ooh-ooh)
(La la-la)
And you won't see me
(You won't see me)
You won't see me
(You won't see me)

Time after time
You refuse to even listen
I wouldn't mind
If I knew what I was missing (no, I wouldn't, no, I wouldn't)

Though the days are few (Ooooh)
(La la-la)
They're filled with tears (Ooooh)
(La la-la)
And since I lost you (Ooooh)
(La la-la)
It feels like years (Ooooh)
(La la-la)
Yes, it seems so long (Ooooh)
(La la-la)
Girl, since you've been gone (Ooooh)
(La la-la)
And I just can' go on (Ooooh)
(La la-la)
If you won't see me
(You won't see me)
You won't see me
(You won't see me)

Time after time
You refuse to even listen
I wouldn't mind
If I knew what I was missing (no, I wouldn't, no, I wouldn't)

Though the days are few (Ooooh)
(La la-la)
They're filled with tears (Ooooh)
(La la-la)
And since I lost you (Ooooh)
(La la-la)
It feels like years (Ooooh)
(La la-la)
Yes, it seems so long (Ooooh)
(La la-la)
Girl, since you've been gone (Ooooh)
(La la-la)
And I just can' go on (Ooooh)
(La la-la)
If you won't see me
(You won't see me)
You won't see me
(You won't see me)
Yeah!

Ooooh la la-la
Spoken: Come on! Hey, hey!
Ooooh la la-la
Ooooh la la-la
