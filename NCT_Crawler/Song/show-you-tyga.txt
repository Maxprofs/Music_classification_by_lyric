                        I'm just now getting to know you (Yeah, yeah)
 There's some things I wanna show you (Show you off, show you off)
 There's a lot I wanna tell you (No doubt, no doubt)
 You're so scared of failures (Don't wanna let it all out)
 There's some things I wanna show you (Show you off, show you off)
 There's some things I wanna show you (Show you off, show you off)
 There's a lot I wanna tell you (No doubt, no doubt)
 You're so scared of failures (Don't wanna let it all out) That pussy man, that's anytime
 Man I get in when I call
 She said couldn't pick a better time
 I know is early, just got back in town
 I'mma be there in a minute, drop that towel and it's going down
 Pull up on your block, all the neighbors watch
 Little things, tell you you pretty, know you get that a lot
 Eyes from a distance, his and hers gold watch
 Everybody seen you wit' 'em, now them heels sold out
 I invest that time, I respect your grind
 Don't keep each other in the dark 'cause the sun won't shine
 Don't wanna rush it right, put that ass fine
 But for now let's just vibe 'cause I'm just now getting to know you (Yeah, yeah)
 There's some things I wanna show you (Show you off, show you off)
 There's a lot I wanna tell you (No doubt, no doubt)
 You're so scared of failures (Don't wanna let it all out)
 There's some things I wanna show you (Show you off, show you off)
 There's some things I wanna show you (Show you off, show you off)
 There's a lot I wanna tell you (No doubt, no doubt)
 You're so scared of failures (Don't wanna let it all out) I see you working on your body, getting ready for summer
 I just got a new phone and I lost your number
 But I'mma get it 'cause it's that important
 Had hit up your so called friends, man them bitches annoying
 I'm on the road, tell me what you doin'
 I got that old love for you, don't let it ruin
 How bout you come see LA like a Bruin,
 Focus on what we got going, not what everybody else doing
 Friday, Friday, party like it's your birthday
 They on the same thing and we changed up, they thirsty
 Drop the top, California never rains
 I feel your love and pain, it's crazy baby 'cause I'm just now getting to know you (Yeah, yeah)
 There's some things I wanna show you (Show you off, show you off)
 There's a lot I wanna tell you (No doubt, no doubt)
 You're so scared of failures (Don't wanna let it all out)
 There's some things I wanna show you (Show you off, show you off)
 There's some things I wanna show you (Show you off, show you off)
 There's a lot I wanna tell you (No doubt, no doubt)
 You're so scared of failures (Don't wanna let it all out) It's like you up and walked in my life out of nowhere (Where you come from?)
 And if I lie you today girl that wouldn't be fair
 I wanna take you round the globe
 Let me show you off everywhere
 And eventually I want us to take it there, oh, yea I'm just now getting to know you (Yeah, yeah)
 There's some things I wanna show you (Show you off, show you off)
 There's a lot I wanna tell you (No doubt, no doubt)
 You're so scared of failures (Don't wanna let it all out)
 There's some things I wanna show you (Show you off, show you off)
 There's some things I wanna show you (Show you off, show you off)
 There's a lot I wanna tell you (No doubt, no doubt)
 You're so scared of failures I'm just now getting to know you
 There's some things I wanna show you
 There's a lot I wanna tell you
 Me so scared of failures
 Got some things I wanna show you
 There's some things I wanna show you
 Got a lot I wanna tell you
 Me so scared of failure
