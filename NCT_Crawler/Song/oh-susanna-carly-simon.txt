                        I came from Alabama
 Wid my banjo on my knee,
 Im gwan to Louisiana
 My true love for to see,
 It raind all night the day I left,
 The weather it was dry,
 The sun so hot I frose to death;
 Susanna, don't you cry. Chorus:
 Oh! Susanna, Oh! don't you cry for me,
 Ive come from Alabama, wid my banjo on my knee. I jumped aboard de telegraph,
 And trabbelled down de ribber,
 De Lectrie fluid magnified,
 And killed five hundred ***
 De bullgine bust, de horse run off,
 I realy thought Id die;
 I shut my eyes to hold my breath,
 Susanna, don't you cry. Chorus: I had a dream de odder night
 When ebery ting was still;
 I thought I saw Susanna,
 A coming down de hill.
 The buckwheat cake war in her mouth,
 The tear was in her eye,
 Says Im coming from de South,
 Susanna, don't you cry. Chorus: I scon will be in New Orleans,
 And den Ill look all round,
 And when I find Susanna,
 I fall upon the ground.
 But if I do not find her,
 Dis darkie I surely die,
 And when Im dead and buried,
 Susanna, don't you cry.
