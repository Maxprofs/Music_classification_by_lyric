                        You don't feel the pain Too much is not enough
 Nobody said this stuff makes any sense
 We're hooked again The point of no return
 See, how the buildings burn
 Light up the night, such pretty sight Adrenaline keeps me in the game
 Adrenaline, you don't even feel the pain
 Wilder than your wildest dreams
 When you're going to extremes, it takes adrenaline You don't feel the pain Sail through an empty night
 It's only you and I who understand
 There is no plan Get closer to the thrill
 Only time can kill
 It's in your eyes is so alive Adrenaline keeps me in the game
 Adrenaline, you don't even feel the pain
 Wilder than your wildest dreams
 When you're going to extremes, it takes adrenaline Run through the speed of sound
 Every thing slows you down
 And all colors that surround you
 Are bleeding to the walls All the things you really need
 Just wait to find the speed
 Then you will achieve escape velocity Too much is not enough
 Nobody gave it up
 I'm not the kind to lay down and die Adrenaline keeps me in the game
 Adrenaline, you don't even feel the pain
 Wilder than your wildest dreams
 When you're going to extremes, it takes adrenaline Adrenaline, screaming out your name
 Adrenaline, you don't even feel the pain
 Wilder than your wildest dreams
 When you're going to extremes, it takes adrenaline Oh, you don't even feel pain
 Oh, you don't even feel pain
 I'm going to extremes
 I'm going to extremes Oh, you don't even feel pain
 You don't even feel pain
 I'm going to extremes
 [Incomprehensible] in the pain And I'm going to extremes
 There is nothing in between
 There is nothing in between And I'm going to extremes
 And I'm going to extremes
 There is nothing in between You don't even feel pain
 You don't even feel pain
 You don't even feel pain
