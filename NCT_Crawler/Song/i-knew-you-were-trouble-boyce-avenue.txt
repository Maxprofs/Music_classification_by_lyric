                        Once upon a time, a few mistakes ago
I was in your sights, you got me alone
You found me, you found me, you found me

I guess you didn’t care, and I guess I liked that
And when I fell hard, you took a step back
Without me, without me, without me

And he’s long gone when he’s next to me
And I realise the blame is on me

Cause I knew you were trouble when you walked in
Shame on me now, flew me to places I’d never been
Til you put me down

Oh, I knew you were trouble when you walked
Shame on me now, flew me to places I’d never been
Now I’m lying on the cold hard ground

Oh, oh. Trouble, trouble, trouble.
Oh, oh. Trouble, trouble, trouble.

No apologies, he’ll never see you cry
Pretend he doesn’t know that you’re the reason why
You’re drowning, you’re drowning, you’re drowning

I heard you moved on from whispers in the street
A new notch in your belt is all I’ll ever be
And now I see, now I see, now I see

He was long gone when we met me
And I realise the joke is on me

Cause I knew you were trouble when you walked in
Shame on me now, flew me to places I’d never been
Til you put me down

Oh, I knew you were trouble when you walked
Shame on me now, flew me to places I’d never been
Now I’m lying on the cold hard ground

Oh, oh. Trouble, trouble, trouble.
Oh, oh. Trouble, trouble, trouble.

And the saddest fear comes creeping in
That you never loved me, or her, or anyone, or anything
YEAH!

I knew you were trouble when you walked in
Shame on me now, flew me to places I’d never been
Til you put me down

Oh, I knew you were trouble when you walked
Shame on me now, flew me to places I’d never been
Now I’m lying on the cold hard ground

Oh, oh. Trouble, trouble, trouble.
Oh, oh. Trouble, trouble, trouble.
I knew you were trouble when you walked in.
