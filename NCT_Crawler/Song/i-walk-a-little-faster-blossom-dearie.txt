                        Pretending that we'll meet
Each time I turn a corner
I walk a little faster

Pretending life is sweet
Cause love is around the corner
I walk a little faster

Can't begin to see my future shine as yet
No sign as yet
You're mine as yet

Rushing toward a face
I can't divine as yet
Keep bumping into walls
And taking lots of falls

But even though I meet
At each and every corner
With nothing but disaster

I set my chin a little higher
Hope a little longer
Build a little stronger castle in the air
And thinking you'll be there
I walk a little faster

Can't begin to see my future shine as yet
No sign as yet
You're mine as yet

Rushing toward a face
I can't divine as yet
Keep bumping into walls
And taking lots of falls

But even though I meet
At each and every corner
With nothing but disaster

I set my chin a little higher
Hope a little longer
Build a little stronger castle in the air
And thinking you'll be there
I walk a little faster
                        
                    |
