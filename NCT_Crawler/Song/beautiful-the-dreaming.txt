                        Cause you are beautiful but your soul is cold and dead
 Angelic but a demon fills your head
 The heaven that you promised life could be
 Was a deadly blended hell and ecstasy God, you are so beautiful
 To diamonds in your eyes I know you're so ugly
 I know you're so ugly on the inside
 I know you're so ugly
 Beautiful but ugly on the inside (on the inside) You are beautiful but ice runs through your veins
 Slowly draining all my life away
 Perfection in a shell devoid of life
 Cause you leave a trail of broken dreams behind Beautiful, you're so beautiful
 But I know that's a lie
                        
                    |
