                        Don't you want to, want to get along?
 Everyday just like a vacation with you
 When I'm watchin' you and Fidel Castro in the sand, kissin'


 Girl you got to roll
 Sister Havana
 Overthrow
 Sister Havana
 She's comin on like a bicycle army
 Everybody's waitin for the man to come down from the tower
 Every day seems like a vacation with you layin' right here now
 I'm watchin you and Fidel Castro in the sand
 Assassin!



 There's no time to lose
 I don't care what they say
 There's no time to lose
 We could have a holiday
 But there's no time for hesitation
 There's no time, no time for waitin'
 So let's take the time and get it on today
                        
                    |
