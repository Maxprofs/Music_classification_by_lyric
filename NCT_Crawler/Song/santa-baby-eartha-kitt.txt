                        Santa Baby, 
Just slip a sable under the tree, 
For me, 
I've been an awful good girl, 
Santa baby, 
So hurry down the chimney tonight 

Santa baby, 
A fifty four convertable too, 
Light blue, 
I'll wait up for you dear, 
Santa baby 
So hurry down the chimney tonight 

Think of all the fun I've missed, 
Think of all the boys I haven't kissed, 
Next year I could be just as good, 
If you check off my Christmas list 

Santa baby, 
I want a yacht and really that's not a lot, 
I've been an angel all year, 
Santa baby, 
So hurry down the chimney tonight, 

Santa honey, 
One little thing I really needed, 
The deed, 
To a platinum mine, 
Santa baby, 
So hurry down the chimney tonight, 

Come and trim my Christmas tree, 
With some decorations bought at Tiffany's, 
I really do believe in you, 
Let's see if you believe in me, 

Santa baby, 
Forgot to mention one little thing, 
A ring, 
I don't mean on the phone 
Santa baby, 
So hurry down the chimney tonight
Hurry down the chimney tonight
Hurry tonight
                        
                    |
