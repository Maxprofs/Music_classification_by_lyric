                        Bài hát: See You Again (T-Mass Remix) - Wiz Khalifa

It's been a long day without you my friend, 
and I'll tell you all about it when I see you again. 
We've come a long way from where we began. 
Oh I'll tell you all about it when I see you again. 

Why do you have to leave so soon? 
Why do you have to go? 
Why do you have to leave me when I needed you the most? 
Cause I don't really know how to tell ya without feeling much worse. 
I know you're in a better place and it's always gonna hurt. 
Carry on, give me all the strength I need. 
To carry on. 

It's been a long day without you my friend, 
and I'll tell you all about it when I see you again. 
We've come a long way from where we began. 
Oh I'll tell you all about it when I see you again. 

How do I breath without ya? 
Feeling so cold. 
I'll be waiting right here for ya till the day you're home. 
Carry on, give me all the strength I need. 
To carry on. 
So let the light guide your way, hold every memory as you go. 
And every road you take will always lead you home. 

It's been a long day without you my friend, 
and I'll tell you all about it when I see you again. 
We've come a long way from where we began. 
Oh I'll tell you all about it when I see you again, when I see you again. 
When I see you again, see you again. 
When I see you again
