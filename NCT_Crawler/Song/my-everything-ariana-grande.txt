                        Bài hát: My Everything - Ariana Grande

I've cried enough tears to see my own reflection in them
And then it was clear
I can't deny
I really missed him
To think that I was wrong
I guess you don't know what you got 'til it's gone
Pain is just a consequence of love
I'm saying sorry for the sake of us

He wasn't my everything 'til we were nothing
And it's taken me a lot to say
And now that he's gone, my heart is missing something
So it's time to push my pride away

'Cause you are, you are, you are my everything
You are, you are, you are my everything

I know you're not far, but I still can't handle all the distance
You're traveling with my heart,
I hope this is a temporary feeling
'Cause it's too much to bear without you
When I lose sight, ain't lookin'
If I go tomorrow, just know I'm yours
'Cause what we got is worth fighting for

'Cause you were, you were my everything 'til we were nothing
And it's taken me a lot to say
And now that you're gone, my heart is missing something
So it's time to push my pride away

You are, you are, you are my everything
You are, you are, you are my everything

You are, you are, you are my everything
