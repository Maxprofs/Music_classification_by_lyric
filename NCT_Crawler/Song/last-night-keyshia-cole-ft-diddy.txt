                        "Last Night"
(feat. Keyshia Cole)

[Diddy:]
Last night,
I couldn't even get an answer.
Tried to call,
But my pride wouldn't let me dial.
And I'm sitting here,
With this blank expression.
And the way I feel,
I wanna curl up like a child.

I know you can hear me
I know you can feel me
I can't live without you
God please make me better
I wish I wasn't the way I am

[Keyshia:]
If I told you once, I told you twice,
You can see it in my eyes.
I'm all cried out,
With nothing to say.
You're everything I wanted to be.
If you could only see,
Your heart belongs to me.
I love you so much, I'm yearning for your touch.
Come and set me free,
Forever yours I'll be,
Baby won't you come and take this pain away.

And the way I feel,

[Keyshia:]
I need you,
And you need me.
This is so plain to see,
And I will never let you go and,
I will always love you so.
I will...
If you could only see,
Your heart belongs to me.
I love you so much, I'm yearning for your touch.
Come and set me free,
Forever yours I'll be,
Baby won't you come and take this pain away.

With this blank expression.
And the way I feel,

[Diddy:]
Tell me what words to say,
To make you come back,
And break me like that.
And if it matters I'll rather stay home,
With you I'm never alone.
Don't want to wait till you're gone,
Whatever you do, just don't leave me.

[Keyshia:]
I'm so alone I'm so lonely,

Why don't you pick the phone,
And dial up my number,
And call me up baby,
I'm waiting on you.

Why don't you pick the phone,
And dial up my number,
Just call me up baby,
I'm waiting on you.

[Phone dialing and ringing]
[Diddy:]
Hello
Hey what's-up
I've been tryin' to reach you all night
That *** ain't funny not picking up the mother*** phone
Better stop *** playing with a nigga's feelings like that
You know how much I love you right?
But for them couple of seconds though,
When I couldn't get in touch with you.
I'm ready to come over your house and shoot that motherfucker up
You better *** not be there when I get over that house
[laughing]
That's really how it goes down right?
