                        Ay yo you Still locked at the hoodest spot
 Still no security, still got a swagga like muh pops
 Still water run deep when that coke is cheap
 But when that price goes soft get ya surf boards out Still got a little pimp in me from muh past
 Still got some lil cousins that'a beat yo ass
 Yo I'm the only dude that you know burn the block up
 So why the hell I gotta call the cops up Shawty is so amazing, bodies bangin', conversation
 My heart is racin' you know what I'm sayin'
 Ya bodies toned up look at those big thighs
 Grandmama musta been feedin' you right
 Shake it to the left mama shake it to the right Somebody call the cops up, lil mama done stole my heart
 She's makin' me fall in love she's not gonna give it up
 Somebody call the cops up somebody call 911
 Tell 'em I been shot threw the heart a grown man and I can't get up
 Somebody call the cops up
