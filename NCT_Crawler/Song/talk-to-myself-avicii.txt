                        Bài hát: Talk To Myself - Avicii 

[Verse 1]
Alone, searching for devotion, in the fading melody
So trying to cross an ocean, now I won't bare to leave
Lock up my [?] at sunrise, who knows what I try to say
My heart all the time was stolen, begging for a treat

[Chorus]
Some nights I talk to myself, I said the words that I could say to no one else
And some nights I talk in my sleep, I said the words I never said when you were with me
Some nights I talk to myself, I said the words that I could say to no one else
And some nights I talk in my sleep, I said the words I never said when you were with me

[Break]

[Verse 2]
I'm gone, love has got me open, love is insanity
So long words are left unspoken, I couldn't set them free
Won't sure the love [?], [?] going on the thing
My heart, I left it broken, [?]

[Chorus]
Some nights I talk to myself, I said the words that I could say to no one else
And some nights I talk in my sleep, I said the words I never said when you were with me
Some nights I talk to myself, I said the words that I could say to no one else
And some nights I talk in my sleep, I said the words I never said when you were with me

Some nights I talk to myself, I said the words that I could say to no one else
And some nights I talk in my sleep, I said the words I never said when you were with me

[Break]
                        
                    |
