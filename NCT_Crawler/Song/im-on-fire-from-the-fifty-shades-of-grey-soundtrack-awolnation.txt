                        [Intro]
 Uuh uuhh! Ouuuh!
 Uuh uuhh! Ouuuh!

 [Verse 1]
 Hey little girl, is your daddy home
 Did he go and leave you all alone
 I got a bad desire
 Uuh uuh, I'm on fire
 Tell me little babe, is he good to you, 
 Can do to you the things that I can't do
 I can, I can take you high
 Uuh uuh, I'm on fire

 Uuh uuhh! Ouuuh!

 [Verse 2]
 Sometimes, that someone can be 
 The one you didn't knew
 At night I wake up with the sheets soaken wet
 Never felt a train running through the middle of my head
 Oh, you can cool my desire
 Uuh uuh, I'm on fire

 [Outro]
 Uuh uuh, I'm on fire
 Uuh uuh, I'm on fire
 Uuh uuh, I'm on fire
 Uuh uuh, I'm on fire

 Uuh uuhh! Ouuuh!
 Uuh uuhh! Ouuuh!
