                        Bài hát: Wind In My Hair (From "Tangled: Before Ever After") - Mandy Moore

Seems like I've spent my whole life hoping
Dreaming of things I've never tried
Tangled in knots just waiting for my time to shine
What if the doors began to open? 
What if the knots became untied?
What if one day nothing stood in my way and the world was mine
Would it feel this fine?

'Cause I got the wind in my hair and a gleam in my eyes and an endless horizon
I got a smile on my face and I'm walking on air
Everything life ought to be 
It's all gonna happen to me out there
And I'll find it, I swear,
With the wind in my hair

So many roads I've yet to travel
So many friends I haven't met
So many new adventures just around the bend
Plenty of mysteries to unravel
Tons of mistakes to not regret
So much to see and to do and to be, a whole life to spend
And it doesn't end

And I got the wind in my hair and a song in my heart and the fun's only started
I got a skip in my step and I haven't a care
That beautiful breeze blowing through
It's gonna carry me who knows where
And I'll take any dare
With the wind in my hair

I got a smile on my face and I'm walking on air
And everything life ought to be 
Well I know that it's waiting for me out there
And I'll find it, I swear,
With the wind in my hair
                        
                    |
