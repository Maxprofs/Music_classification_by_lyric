Rock|

                        We causing utter devastation 
When we steppin' into place 
And better believe that you can see 
We're gonna rock and never stop 
And here we go again 
Hit you with the flow again 
get up the second time around 
and bring it on again - shout it out 

Buddy you're a boy 
Make a big noise playin' in the street 
Gonna be a big man someday 
You got blood in your face (c'mon) 
big disgrace 
Kicking your can (ah ah) all over the place 

Singing 
We will, we will rock you 
(ha, ha) 
We will, we will rock you 
c'mon 
How about a little something 
To get you in the mood 
Know what I mean? 
Watch your back 
We got Queen on this track 
Bring the feedback 
And let it drop 
As long as five bring the funk 
Queen bring the rock 
And it don't stop 

Buddy you're a young man 
Hard man 
shouting in the street 
Gonna take on the world some day 
You got blood on your face, 
You big disgrace 
Waving you're banner all over the place, 

Singing 
We will, we will rock you 
(we're gonna rock, we're gonna rock, we're gonna rock you baby!) 
We will, we will rock you 
(we're gonna rock, we're gonna rock yeah) 
We will, we will rock you 
(we're gonna rock you baby!) 
We will, we will rock you ha ha 

Go(x30) 
ah! 
Buddy, you're an old man, poor man 
Pleading with your eyes gonna 
make you something someday 
You got mud on your face (c'mon), 
big disgrace 
Somebody better put you back in your place 

Singing 
we will, we will rock you 
We will, we will rock you 
We will, we will rock you
