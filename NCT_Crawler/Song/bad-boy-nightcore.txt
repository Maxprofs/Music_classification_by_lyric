                        Bài hát : Bad Boy - Nightcore

Remember the feelings, remember the day 
My stone heart was breaking 
My love ran away 
This moment I knew I would be someone else 
My love turned around and I felt 
Be my bad boy, be my man 
Be my week-end lover 
But don't be my friend 
You can be my bad boy 
But understand 
That I don't need you in my life again 
Won't you be my bad boy, be my man 
Be my week-end lover 
But don't be my friend 
You can be my bad boy 
But understand 
That I don't need you again 
No I don't need you again 

bad boy! 

You once made this promise 
To stay by my side 
But after some time you just pushed me a side 
You never thought that a girl could be strong 
Now I'll show you how to go on 

Be my bad boy, be my man 
Be my week-end lover 
But don't be my friend 
You can be my bad boy 
But understand 
That I don't need you in my life again 

Won't you be my bad boy, be my man 
Be my week-end lover 
But don't be my friend 
You can be my bad boy 
But understand 
That I don't need you again 
No I don't need you again
                        
                    |
