                        How I'm feeling, it doesn't matter
 Cause you know I'm okay
 Instead, I ask myself "why do you hurt me?"
 When know, you know I'm the same
 And no, I know you don't love me baby
 Time to take you away from me
 Only, over my dead body...

 I think I killed everybody in the game last year, man
 *** it I was on though
 And I thought I found the girl of my dreams at a strip club
 *** it I was wrong though
 Shout out to all my niggas living tax free
 Now-a-days it's six figures when they tax me
 Oh well, I guess you lose some and win some
 Long as the outcome is income
 You know I want it all and then some
 Shout out to asian girls, let the lights dim sum
 Shots came, I don't know where they was sent from
 Probably some bad hoes about to take the hint from
 Yeah, you know me well nigga
 I mean you ain't the only real nigga
 They got me on these white women like seal nigga
 Slave to the pussy but I'm just playing a field nigga
 All these people really discussing my career again
 Asking if I'll be going platinum in a year again
 Don't I got the *** the world wanna hear again?
 Don't michael jordan still got his hoop earing in?
 Man all of your flows bore me: paint drying
 And I don't ever be trippin off of what ain't mine
 And I be hearing *** you say through the grapevine
 But jealousy is just love and hate at the same time
 It's been that way from the beginning
 And I'm just playing, didn't even notice that I was winning
 And this is the only sound you should fear
 These kids wear crowns over here and everything is alright

 [Hook:]

 You say I'm old news, well who the new star?
 Cause if I'm going anywhere, it's probably too far
 Just performed at a bar mitzvah over in the states
 Used half of the money to beat my brother's case
 Red wine over fed time
 And shout out to the niggas that's doing their time
 Shout out to the bitches there when it's bedtime
 And *** you to the niggas who think it's their time
 Don't make me take your life apart boy
 You and whoever the *** yeah, you a star boy
 Or you wanna be a mutha***in funny guy?
 Don't make me break your Kevin heart boy
 Yeah, it's whatever. You know, feeling good, living better
 I think maybe I was numb to it last year
 But you know I feel it now more than ever
 My city love me like mac dre in the bay
 Second album, I'm back paving the way
 The backpackers are back on the bandwagon
 Like this was my comeback season back, back in the day
 And I met your baby moms last night
 We took a picture together - I hope she frames it!
 And I was drinking at the palms last night
 And ended up losing everything that I came with
 Feel like I've been here before huh?
 Still got 10 years to go huh?
 This is the only sound you should fear
 Man These kids wear crowns over here
 And everything is all right
