                        'm afraid I'm starting to feel
What I said I would not do
The last time really hurt me


Pre Chours:
I'm scared to fall in love
Afraid to love so fast
'Cause every time I fall in love
It seems to never last


Chorus:
But every time your love is near
And every time I'm filled with fear
'Cause every time I see your face
My heart does begins to race every time

One half wants me to go
One half wants me to stay
I just get so all confused


Pre Chorus:
I'm scared to fall in love
Afraid to love so fast
'Cause every time I fall in love
It seems to never last

Chours:
But every time your love is near
And every time I'm filled with fear
'Cause every time Ahhh
My heart does begin to race everytime

n'da da dada da dada
n'da da dada da dada
n'da da dada da dada
n'da da dada da dada

Pre chours:
I'm scared to fall in love
Afraid to love so fast
'Cause every time I fall in love
It seems to never last

Chorus:
But every time your love is near
And every time I'm filled with fear
'Cause every time I see your face
My heart does begins to race every time

(its every time, its every time)

Every time your love is near
And every time I'm filled with fear
'Cause every time I see your face
Could it be that this will be the one that lasts
The fear does start to erase every time
Oh could it be that this will be the one that lasts
For all my times
For all my times
