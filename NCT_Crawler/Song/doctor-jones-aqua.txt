                        Sometimes the feeling is right
 You fall in love for the first time
 Heartbeat and kisses so sweet
 Summer time, love in the moonlight Aaa yippie yaa ooo ooo
 Aaa yippie yaa yea
 Aaa yippie yaa ooo ooo, aaa haa Now the summer is gone
 You have to go back home
 Please come and see me again
 I never felt more alone
 (Baby, I'm missing you)
 I want you by my side
 (And I hope you miss me too)
 Come back and stay
 (I think about you every day)
 I really want you to
 (You set my feet right off the ground 'til the lover found) Doctor Jones, Jones
 Calling Doctor Jones, "Doctor Jones, Doctor Jones, get up now"
 (Wake up now)
