Title: Breakeven (Live At the Aviva Stadium, Dublin)
Artist: The Script

I'm still alive but
I'm barely breathing
Just prayed to a God
that I don't believe in
Cause I got time while
she got freedom
Cause when a heart breaks
no it don't break even

Her best days will be
some of my worst
She finally met a man
that's gonna put her first
While I'm wide awake
she's no trouble sleeping
Cause when a heart breaks
no it don't break even, even, no
What am I supposed to do when
the best part of me was always you, and
What am I supposed to say when
I'm all choked up and you're okay
I'm falling to pieces, yeah
I'm falling to pieces

They say bad things
happen for a reason
But no wise words
gonna stop me bleeding
Cause she moved on
while I'm still grieving
And when a heart breaks
no it dont break even, even no
What am I gonna do when the best
part of me was always you, and
What am I supposed to say when
I'm all choked up and you're okay
I'm falling to pieces, yeah
I'm falling to pieces, yeah
I'm falling to pieces
I'm falling to pieces

Oh, you got his heart and my
heart and none of the pain
You took your suitcase,
I took the blame
Now I'm tryna make sence
of what little remains
Cause you left me with no love,
with no love to my name
I'm still alive but
I'm barely breathing
Just prayed to a God
that I don't believe in
Cause I got time
while she got freedom
Cause when a heart
breaks no it don't break
No it don't break,
no it dont break even, no
What am I gonna do when the best
part of me was always you, and
What am I supposed to say when
I'm all choked up and you're okay
I'm falling to pieces, yeah
I'm falling to pieces, yeah
I'm falling to pieces
I'm falling to pieces

Oh, it don't break even, no
Oh, it don't break even, no
Oh, it don't break even, no
