                        Bài hát: I Bet - Ciara

I bet you start loving me
Soon as I start loving someone else
Somebody better than you
I bet you start needing me
Soon as you see me with someone else
Somebody other than you
And I know that it hurts
You know that it hurts your pride
But you thought the grass was greener on the other side
I bet you start loving me
Soon as I start loving someone else
Somebody better than you

So I'm supposed to believe that it's Fellini's calling your phone?
I'm supposed to believe that they're asking you if you're at home?
I wasn't born yesterday, not me
Can't get that over me, not me
I love you but I won't be a fool for you
That was just something that I wouldn't do, babe
I mean I would stay if you could tell the truth (be honest!)
But you can't, no matter how much time I ask

Is that your bitch over there?
Giving me the ugly stare
The one with the silicone ass
And the Brazilian hair
You ain't gon' respect me
No no no, til I'm not there
See I got you comfortable
Now you ain't really scared

But I bet you start loving me
Soon as I start loving someone else
Somebody better than you
I bet you start needing me
Soon as you see me with someone else
Somebody other than you
And I know that it hurts
You know that it hurts your pride
But you thought the grass was greener on the other side
I bet you start loving me
Soon as I start loving someone else
Somebody better than you

So you bought me a car?
He can buy that too
I can take care of myself
And I can find someone to do it too, baby
You actin' like you upgraded me, I upgraded you
You and me, Fashion Week in Pari'
I put you onto that new

But you took advantage
Oh you took advantage
Oh you took advantage
I cannot understand
I cannot understand
I cannot understand it
I thought you'd always be there for me
Yeah, yeah
But if you ask me if I knew better now
Hell, yeah

So you can keep that bitch over there
Giving me the ugly stare
The one with the silicone ass
And the Brazilian hair
You ain't gon' respect me
No no no, til I ain't there
See I got you comfortable
Now you ain't really scared

But I bet you start loving me (I bet)
Soon as I start loving someone else
Somebody better than you
I bet you start needing me
Soon as you see me with someone else
Somebody other than you
And I know that it hurts
You know that it hurts your pride
But you thought the grass was greener on the other side
I bet you start loving me (Oh!)
Soon as I start loving someone else
Somebody better than you

Baby tell me what's it gonna take to keep it
All the way 100, you won't get it
Till I'm gone away, away

I bet you start loving me (I bet)
Soon as I start loving someone else
Somebody better than you (somebody better than you)
I bet you start needing me (start needing me)
Soon as you see me with someone else (see me with someone else)
Somebody other than you (other than you)
And I know that it hurts
You know that it hurts your pride
But you thought the grass was greener on the other side
I bet you start loving me (I bet you start loving me)
Soon as I start loving someone else
Somebody better than you

Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
I hate, I hate that I'm
Singing this song
Singing this song
'Cause I love you
Yeah I love you

Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
I'm all cried out
I'm all tried out
I'm all fired out
Yeah

Right now, it's killing me
Cause now I have to find someone else
When all I wanted was you

Na na, na na, na na, na na, na na
                        
                    |
