                        Bài hát: See You Again & One Call Away (Mashup Cover) - J.Fla

It's been a long day without you, my friend
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
We've come a long way from where we began
Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
When I see you again

Call me, baby, if you need a friend 
I just wanna give you love 
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon 
Reaching out to you, so take a chance 

No matter where you go 
You know you're not alone 

I'm only one call away 
I'll be there to save the day 
Superman got nothing on me 
I'm only one call away 

It's been a long day without you, my friend
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
We've come a long way from where we began
Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
When I see you again

Come along with me and don't be scared 
I just wanna set you free 
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon 
You and me can make it anywhere 

No matter where you go 
You know you're not alone 

I'm only one call away 
I'll be there to save the day 
Superman got nothing on me 
I'm only one call away 
I'm only one call away
                        
                    |
