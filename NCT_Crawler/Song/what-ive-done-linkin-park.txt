                        Bài hát: What Ive Done - Linkin Park

Band: link in park (loi mon trong cong vien)
In this farewell
There’s no blood
There’s no alibi
‘cause i’ve drawn regret
From the truth
Of a thousand lies

[pre-chorus:]
So let mercy come
And wash away
What i’ve done

[chorus:]
I'll face myself
To cross out what i’ve become
Erase myself
And let go of what i’ve done

Put to rest
What you thought of me
While i clean this slate
With the hands of uncertainty

[pre-chorus]

[chorus]

For what i’ve done
I start again
And whatever pain may come
Today this ends
I’m forgiving what i’ve done!!!

[chorus]

What i’ve done
Forgiving what i’ve done
