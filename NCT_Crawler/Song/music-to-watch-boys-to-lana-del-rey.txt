                        Bài hát: Music To Watch Boys To - Lana Del Rey 

[Chorus] 
I like you a lot 
Putting on my music while I'm watching the boys 
So I do what you want 
Singing soft grunge just to soak up the noise 
Blue ribbons on ice 
Playing their guitars, only one of my toys 
Cause I like you a lot 
No holds barred, I've been sent to destroy, yeah 

[Verse 1] 
Pi-i-i-ink flamingos, always fascinated me 
I know what only the girls know 
Colours with lights begin to mean 
Oh, oh, I see you're going 
So-o-o-o I play my music, watch you leave 

[Chorus] 
I like you a lot 
Putting on my music while I'm watching the boys 
So I do what you want 
Singing soft grunge just to soak up the noise 
Blue ribbons on ice 
Playing their guitars, only one of my toys 
Cause I like you a lot 
No holds barred, I've been sent to destroy, yeah 

[Verse 2] 
Velveteen and living single 
It never felt that right to me 
I know what only the girls know 
Lies can buy eternity 
I, I, I see you leaving 
So-o-o-o I push record and watch you leave 

[Chorus] 
I like you a lot 
Putting on my music while I'm watching the boys 
So I do what you want 
Singing soft grunge just to soak up the noise 
Blue ribbons on ice 
Playing their guitars, only one of my toys 
Cause I like you a lot 
No holds barred, I've been sent to destroy, yeah 

[Bridge] 
Live to love you 
And I love to love you 
And I live to love you, boy 
Live to love you 
And I love to love you 
And I live to love you, boy 
Nothing gold can stay 
Like love or lemonade 
Or sun or summer days 
It's all a game to me anyway 

[Chorus] 
I like you a lot 
Putting on my music while I'm watching the boys 
So I do what you want 
Singing soft grunge just to soak up the noise 
Blue ribbons on ice 
Playing their guitars, only one of my toys 
Cause I like you a lot 
No holds barred, I've been sent to destroy, yeah 

[Outro] 
Putting on my music while I'm watching the boys 
Putting on my music while I'm watching the boys
