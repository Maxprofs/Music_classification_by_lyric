                        Bài hát: One More Time - Chris Medina

Every time I try to look away
See your face on our reflection
Every choice I try to make, I pray
Leads me in a right direction
I don't know what it is, but I know I'm missing it
Missing out
But the memory we made remains, remains

Won't you hold me like you used to
Hold it, girl, just one more time
Won't you love me like you used to
Love with you is so sublime
I was there for you, you were there for me
Can we get this back again?
Won't you hold me like you used to
Hold it, girl, Just one more time

Tell me how long has it been, since we show each other some affection
Tell me how long will it take, till we done with all this introspection
I don't know why it hurts, but I know I'm missing you, and I know you missing me
We been doing this so long, common, common

Won't you hold me like you used to
Hold it, girl, just one more time
Won't you love me like you used to
Love with you is so sublied
I was there for you, you where the for me
Can we get this back again?
Won't you hold me like you used to
Hold it, girl. Just one more time

Could it ever be (Could it ever be)
Could it ever be
Could it ever be like it was before
Only in my dream (only in my dream)
(only in my dream)

I'll wait for you, will you wait for me?

Won't you hold me like you used to
Hold it, girl, just one more time
Won't you love me like you used to
Love with you is so sublime
I was there for you, you where the for me
Can we get this back again?
Won't you hold me like you used to
Hold it, girl. Just one more time
