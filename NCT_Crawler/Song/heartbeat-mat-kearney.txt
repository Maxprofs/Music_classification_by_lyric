                        Nashville its burning tonight
 You turn me right round, baby like a forty-five
 And I'm feeling every song that this town could write
 Well the fire in my head
 And the tremor in my chest
 Just take one look in my eyes and they will confess
 That you got me feeling so high
 And you are the rhythm of my life, my life I feel your heart beat, beat, beat
 Beating right next to me
 That keep, keep, keep
 I be feeling like I believe
 All the things, baby, that we could be
 I feel your heart beat, beat, beat
 Beating right next to me
 Beating right next to me
 Beating right next to me I feel your heart beat
 I feel your heart beat
 I feel your heart beat
 Heart beat, your heart beat Ain't bringing you no games
 Ain't leaning on no cliche
 If you sharing my bed, then babe
 You share my name
 'Cause you got me feeling so high
 Oh baby, you are the rhythm of my life, life I feel your heart beat, beat, beat
 Beating right next to me
 That keep, keep, keep
 I be feeling like I believe
 All the things, baby, that we could be
 I feel your heart beat, beat, beat
 Beating right next to me
 Beating right next to me
 Beating right next to me I feel your heart beat
 I feel your heart beat
 I feel your heart beat
 Heart beat, your heart beat I feel your heart beat, beat, beat
 Beating right next to me
 That keep, keep, keep
 I be feeling like I believe
 All the things, baby, that we could be
 I feel your heart beat, beat, beat
 Beating right next to me I feel your heart beat
 I feel your heart beat
 I feel your heart beat
 Heart beat, your heart beat I feel your heart beat
 I feel your heart beat
 I feel your heart beat
 Heart beat, your heart beat
