                        Don't tell me you wanna be
The kind of girl who's drowning
And don't be holding on to anything
That's gonna keep you frowning, darling

Everyone's compelled to look into the mirror
When they're crying
Just because your tears are pretty
Doesn't mean they'll get you by

Sing me a sad song and make me feel better
Sing me a happy song and I might start to cry
Because everything feels like it's going around in circles
And everyone knows that the world is upside down

You were once a little baby
Full of optimistic wonder
So what got into you to make you think
That it could pull you under, honey

Could it be that we were under
The impression life was perfect?
And when the bubble burst
We understood that every part of it hurts

Sing me a sad song and make me feel better
Sing me a happy song and I might start to cry
Because everything feels like it's going around in circles
And everyone knows that the world is upside down

I'm going to color my glasses rose
I'm going to go where the rainbow goes
And my pot of gold will be waiting
                        
                    |
