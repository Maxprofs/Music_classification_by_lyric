                        I can't stay away from you too long
 Even if I do I'll always call
 Checkin' on you, make sure you're okay
 Be the one to brighten up your day, yeah, yeah And the point of it all
 Is I love you, yeah
 You know I love you, baby My days seem long whenever we're apart
 It's like someone has thrown away my heart
 You're a major part of my life
 And no matter what the storm may bring I'm fine with you And the point of it all
 Is I love you
 And the reason for it all
 Is I love you I love you, girl
 (Oh, I love you)
 I love you, girl
 (Oh, I love you)
 Oh, I love you
 (Oh, I love you, girl) I can't stay away
 (I can't stay away too long)
 I can't stay away from you, baby
 (I can't stay away too long)
 Don't wanna be without you, I need you
 (I can't stay away too long)
 Oh, why don't you stay around for awhile?
 (I can't stay away too long) And the point of it all
 And the point of it all
 And the point of it all
 And the point of it all And the reason for it all
 And the point of it all
 Is I love you, yeah
 I love you, love you
 Love you, love, love you Whenever we're apart
 It damn near starves my heart
 I don't ever want to be apart
