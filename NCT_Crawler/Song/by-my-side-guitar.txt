                        Bài hát: By My Side - Guitar

Kiss me, good bye, gone to soon 
I did give you my heart can't deny 
Hold on, let go, never sure 
Only can make believe all this time 

Coffee, cigarettes, not my style 
Petty faces around but not rhymed 
Don't cry, won't cry, I won't cry 
Be with you I just close my eyes 

So far alway I can hardly make you mine 
So long the day you are always on my mind 
But in my dreams never try to hold you tight 
Don't wanna awake find you aren't here by my side 

So far alway I can hardly make you mine 
So long the day you are always on my mind 
But in my dreams never try to hold you tight 
Don't wanna awake find you aren't here by my side 
When I wake up hope you were here by my side.
                        
                    |
