                        I WANT TO BREAK FREE 

( QUEEN - FREDDIE MERCURY ) 

I want to break free 
I want to break free 
I want to break free from your lies 
Youre so self satisfied I don't need you 
Ive got to break free 
God knows God knows I want to break free 

Ive fallen in love 
Ive fallen in love for the first time 
And this time I know it's for real 
Ive fallen in love yeah 
God knows God knows Ive fallen in love 

Its strange but it's true 
I can't get over the way you love me like you do 
But I have to be sure 
When I walk out that door 
Oh how I want to be free baby 
Oh how I want to be free 
Oh how I want to break free 

But life still goes on 
I can't get used to living without living without 
Living without you by my side 
I don't want to live alone hey 
God knows got to make it on my own 
So baby can't you see 
Ive got to break free 

Ive got to break free 
I want to break free yeah 

I want I want I want I want to break free....
