                        Bài hát: Hair - Suicideboys

[Oddy Nuff da $now Leopard:]
Hair down, smoking on a blunt
Smoking a *** cigarette to *** up both of my lungs
*** you mean you hung yourself from the top bunk, bitch?
You ain't even high enough to touch a Glock, boy
Bitch, I put it to my skull
Bitch, believe I will drop, boy
Drop dead in the middle of the block, boy
Stuck between a hard place and a rock, boy
Rot in the box
Breaking the locks
Time is money
I ain't even got a clock, boy
Watch them hoes flock, boy
Break my *** heart and now I'm busting out shots, boy
Put it to my head and watch my head pop, boy
Don't quit your day job, who the *** else gonna stock, boy?
You mother *** box boy

[$lick $loth:]
Hair up, purple double cup
Bodies in the trunk
Never front, this ain't what you want
30 in the pump
$uicide, take my own life
Every night I die, every night I'm high
Another depressing ass alibi
Reason for the drugs, reason for the subs
Give a *** about the club, I'll walk up in that bitch and shoot that mother ***er up
*** the DJ, *** your clique, and *** your songs boy
I swear I hate you mother ***ers, leave me alone boy
*** a scene, *** a trend, *** your clothes, too
*** you mean you with your team and that's your hoe too?
Give a *** about your dreams or your whole crew
And if this is what is seems, I'm hollering *** YOU!
