                        Bài hát: Waking Up Slow (Piano) - Gabrielle Aplin

Heaven help me
My mind changes like the wind
Please excuse me
I don't know where to begin

But I didn't think I cared
I could be your friend
But I'm unprepared
Oh, I've never felt like this
I was unaware
You were lighting flares
Now I'm running scared
How did it come to this?

You know I've never been so lonely on my own
And it shows 'cause I don't see you like I used to
Now I'm going back on the things that I know

Oh, all my nights taste like gold
Yeah, when I'm with you it's like everything glows
And all my days we can lay low
Yeah, when we're waking up, we're waking up slow

I can rearrange
Could you do the same?
I don't wanna change
But you're just too good to miss
'Cause I'm intertwined
And I'm running blind
But I don't mind
I'm so glad it came to this

You know I've never been so lonely on my own
And it shows 'cause I don't see you like I used to
Now I'm going back on the things that I know

Oh, all my nights taste like gold
Yeah, when I'm with you it's like everything glows
And all my days we can lay low
Yeah, when we're waking up, we're waking up slow

It's a little bit clearer now
I love you like the sun came out
Oh, we're waking up, we're waking up slow
It's like I never had a doubt
I love you like the sun came out
Oh, we're waking up, we're waking up

Like I told ya
Don't look backwards
'Cause now I see you here
Nothing else matters
Like I told ya
Don't look backwards
'Cause now I see you here
I'm going back on the things that I know

Oh, all my nights taste like gold
Yeah, when I'm with you it's like everything glows
And all my days we can lay low
Yeah, when we're waking up, we're waking up slow

It's a little bit clearer now
I love you like the sun came out
Oh, we're waking up, we're waking up slow
It's like I never had a doubt
I love you like the sun came out
Oh, we're waking up, we're waking up
                        
                    |
