                        "I've waited a hundred years, but I'd wait a million more for you.
Nothing prepared me for the privilege of being yours.
If I had only felt the warmth within your touch,
If I had only seen how you smile when you blush,
Or how you curl your lip when you concentrate enough.
I would have known what I was living for, What I've been living for.


Your love is my turning page, only the sweetest words remain.
Every kiss is a cursive line.
Every touch is a redefining phrase.


I surrender who I've been for who you are.
Nothing makes me stronger than your fragile heart.
If I had only felt how it feels to be yours, I would have known what I've been living for all along.
What I've been living for.


We're tethered to the story we must tell.
When I saw you, well, I knew we'd tell it well.
With the whisper, we will tame the vicious scenes,
Like a feather bringing kingdoms to their knees."
