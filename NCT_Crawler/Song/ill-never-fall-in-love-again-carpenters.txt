                        (Here to remind you, here to remind you,

 Here to remind you, here to remind you)

 What do you get when you fall in love

 A girl with a pin to burst your bubble

 That's what you get for all your troubble

 I'll never fall in love again

 I'll never fall in love again

 What do you get when you kiss a guy

 You get enough germs to catch pneumonia

 After you do, he'll never phone you

 I'll never fall in love again

 I'll never fall in love again

 Don't tell me what it's all about

 'Cause I've been there and I'm glad I'm out

 Out of those chains, those chains that bind you

 That is why I'm here to remind you

 What do you get when you fall in love?

 You only get lies and pain and sorrow

 So far at least until tomorrow

 I'll never fall in love again

 I'll never fall in love again

 Don't tell me what it's all about

 'Cause I've been there and I'm glad I'm out

 Out of those chains, those chains that bind you

 That is why I'm have here to remind you

 Here to remind you, here to remind you

 Toh! Here to remind you

 What do you get when you fall in love

 You only get lies and pain and sorrow

 So, far at least until tomorrow

 I'll never fall in love again

 I'll never fall in love again
