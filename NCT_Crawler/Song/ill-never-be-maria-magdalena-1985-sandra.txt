                        You take my love you want my soul
I would be crazy to share your life
why can't you see what I am
sharpen your senses and turn the knife
hold me and you'll understand

[Refrain:]
I'll never be MARIA MAGDALENA
(you're a creature of the night)
MARIA MAGDALENA (you're the victim of
the fight you need love)
promise me delight (you need love)
I'll never be MARIA MAGDALENA
(you're the preacher of the night)
MARIA MAGDALENA (you're the victim of
the fight you need love)
promise me delight (you need love)

Why must I lie
Find any prize
When will you wake up and realize
I can't surrender to you
Play for affection and
Win the prize
I know these party games too

[Refrain:]
I'll never be MARIA MAGDALENA
(you're the preacher of the night)

MARIA MAGDALENA (you're the victim of
the fight you need love)
promise me delight (you need love)
I'll never be MARIA MAGDALENA
(you're the preacher of the night)
MARIA MAGDALENA (you're the victim of
the fight you need love)
promise me delight (you need love)

Oh oh oh - oh oh oh oh oh oh .......
oh oh oh - oh oh oh oh oh oh .......
