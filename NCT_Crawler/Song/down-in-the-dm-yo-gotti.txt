                        Bài hát: Down In The *** - Yo Gotti

I seen your girl post her BM
I see your girl post her BMW
So I hit her in her ***
All eyes, yeah I see ’em
Yeah, that's your man? I'd hate to be him (whoop)
It goes down in the *** (it go down)
It go down in the *** (it go down, it go...down)
It goes down in the *** (it go down)
It go down in the *** (it go down, it go... down)

[Verse 1: Yo Gotti]
I tell her
Snapchat me that pussy...mood
Or Facetime me that pussy if it's...cool
(Whoo) Boy, my *** poppin' (*** poppin')
My *** just caught a body
I got celebs in this ***
They breakin' news if they see them
But nah we don't do no talkin' (we don't do no talkin')
We see sucker *** too often (*** nigga)
[Hook: Yo Gotti]
I seen your girl post her BM
So I hit her in her ***
All eyes, yeah I see ’em
Yeah, that's your man? I'd hate to be him (whoop)
It goes down in the *** (it go down)
It go down in the *** (it go down, it go...down)
It goes down in the *** (it go down)
It go down in the *** (it go down, it go... down)

[Verse 2: Yo Gotti]
Don't you hate when you get screenshot? (petty)
Bitch that *** wasn't for everybody (rules)
I love the ’Gram, I love the ’Gram (I love the ’Gram)
I'm addicted to it, I know I am (I know I am)
And I just followed Angela (Simmons)
Boy, I got a crush on Angela Simmons
They like, "Damn Gotti, you bold"
*** it, I'ma let the world know (#goals)
