Living inside and waiting for the night
Living it up when someone gets the light
My body will go where music goes
Where I can lose control

Never gonna give it up
I ever wanna stop
Never ever give it up
I'll never give it up
Never gonna give it up
I never wanna stop
Never ever give it up
I'll never give it up
La, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la

Taking it in and begging for some more
Spinning around and sliding cross the floor
I'm gonna be where music shows
The color of every soul

Never gonna give it up
I never wanna stop
Never ever give it up
I'll never give it up
Never gonna give it up
I never wanna stop
Never ever give it up
I'll never give it up
La, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la

In the night I'm never lonely
Out of sight I'm never lonely
Never lonely
Oh, oh yeah
Oh, oh

Never gonna give it up
I never wanna stop
Never ever give it up
I'll never give it up
Never gonna give it up
I never wanna stop
Never ever give it up
I'll never give it up
La, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la
