[00:-1.00]
Money just changed everything,
I wonder how life without it would go
From the concrete, who knew that a flower would grow?
Lookin' down from the top and it's crowded below
My fifteen minutes started an hour ago
Truth over fame, you know I respect the blatant ***
When I hear 'em talkin, I just don't know what to make of it
Hate is so familiar to me, I'm slowly embracing it
Doesn't come natural, bare with me it could take a bit
Yeah, and my dreams are who I'm racing with
You can see I'm pacin' it so that I'm always chasin' it
Wayne put me right here, that's who I get the paper with
I hope that my success never alters our relationship
Yeah, this life is something I would die for
October's Own, but it's lookin' like July 4th
I just wish they'd let you try it first
This time I'm really goin off, fireworks

When I go off like July 4th

Feels like a fire, got to go higher

It's your revelation, sweet celebration
Light me like a rocket, cause can't nothing stop it

All I see is fireworks

Every night its fireworks

Taking off like fireworks

Takin' off like oh-ah-oh-oh
I'm just such a gentleman, you should give it up for me
Look at how I'm placing all my napkins and my cutlery
I could tell it wasn't love, I just thought you'd *** with me
Who coulda predicted love could strike, would have you stuck with me?
Damn, I kept my wits about me luckilly
What happened between us that night?
It always seems to trouble me
Now all of a sudden these gossip brags wanna cover me
And you making it seem like it happened that way because of me
But I was curious, and I'll never forget it, baby
What an experience
You coulda been the one but it wasn't that serious
There was smoke in the air before, that was me clearing it
That felt good
All and all I learned a lesson from it though
You never see it coming, you just get to see it go
Yeah, I shoulda looked up in the sky at first
Now I can see it in her eyes

Fireworks
Light me like a rocket, cause can't nothin' stop it
Everything the same, but it feels different
My dad called me up, knowing that I still listen
And he's still got his foot out, guilt trippin'
It's been years, though, I just learn to deal with it
For real, me and my realtor we built up a better rapport
Got my mother in a place with some better decor
She searched the entire city, I let her explore
And now she's sayin' she's more lonely than ever before
How many of our parents' marriages lasted?
I was only 5, I bet I barely reacted
I'm flying back home for the heritage classic
Searchin' for that feeling, tell me where is the magic?
Let's stay together 'til we're ghosts
I want to witness love, I've never seen it close
Yeah, but I guess I gotta find it first
That's why I'm really going off,
Light me like a rocket, cause' can't nothing stop it
