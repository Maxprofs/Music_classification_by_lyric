Rock|

                        I was tempted
 Like a desperate child
 Sent out in the world to taste it It was colder than steel
 Frozen in fields
 Emptied by the turning of pages Falling like stone
 Over and over
 Falling alone
 Hold on hold on Love, will save my soul someday
 Love, will save my soul someday Take me away
 Take me so far away
 Love will save my soul someday I was trusted like a heart of gold
 Walked out on this earth to make it
 Yea, I'm better than bad
 Stronger than sad
 Harder than the rock of ages Fallin' like stones
 Over and over
 Falling alone
 Hold on, hold on Love, will save my soul someday
 Love, will save my soul someday Take me away
 Take me so far away
 Love will save my soul someday Fallin' like stone
 Over and over
 Falling alone
 Hold on, oh hold on Love, will save my soul someday
 Love, will save my soul someday Take me away
 Take me so far away
 Love will save my soul Love, will save my soul someday
 Love, will save my soul someday
                        
                    |
