                        I could feel it
 Coming from a mile away
 When I opened up the door
 I saw everything that I've been waiting for, hey Close your eyes
 I don't care what other people say
 Here underneath the stars
 Now Jupiter and Mars don't seem so far away I want you to know, you take my breath away
 And it's been that way right from the start
 I didn't know how to tell you
 That I want to love you with every beat of my heart
 With every beat of my heart Take my hand
 Don't be afraid, don't go, I want you to stay
 Just relax your mind
 I promise that tomorrow will be just like today I want you to know, you take my breath away
 And it's been that way right from the start
 I didn't know how to tell you
 That I want to love you with every beat of my heart
 With every beat of my heart Ooh, ooh
 Hey With every beat of my heart
 I said, I want you to know, you take my breath away
 And it's been that way right from the start
 I didn't know how to tell you
 That I want to love you with every beat of my heart
 With every beat of my heart I said, I want you to know, you take my breath away
 And it's been that way right from the start
 I didn't know how to tell you
 That I want to love you with every beat of my heart
 With every beat of my heart With every beat of my heart
 With every beat of my heart
