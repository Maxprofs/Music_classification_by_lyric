                        Bài hát: Hypnotized - Deamn

[Verse 1]
Baby, your body got me so confused
I like the way it moves
I’ll show you something good
Let me get close to you, close to you

[Pre-Chorus]]
I lost my mind (mind)
I want you to be mine (be mine)
I’m hypnotized (hypnotized)
When I look into your eyes

[Chorus]
I wanna be
I wanna be your girl
Do you like me?
Do you like me, my boy?
I wanna be
I wanna be your girl
So, baby, please, take all my love

[Drop]
I wanna be your girl
I wanna be your girl

[Verse 2]
Baby, I swear to you, my love is true
I wanna spend the nights with you
I’ll show you something good
Let me get close to you, close to you (close to you)

[Pre-Chorus]]
I lost my mind (I lost my mind)
I want you to be mine (I want you to be mine)
I’m hypnotized (I’m hypnotized)
When I look into your eyes (When I look into your eyes)

[Chorus]
I wanna be
I wanna be your girl
Do you like me?
Do you like me, my boy?
I wanna be
I wanna be your girl
So, baby, please, take all my love

[Drop] 
I wanna be your girl
I wanna be your girl

[Bridge]
I wanna be your girl (I wanna)
I wanna be your girl (I wanna)

[Chorus]
I wanna be
I wanna be your girl
Do you like me?
Do you like me, my boy?
I wanna be
I wanna be your girl
So, baby, please, take all my love

[Drop]
I wanna be your girl (I wanna be your girl)
I wanna be your girl (I wanna be your girl)
