                        Bài hát: Because I Love You (Bởi Vì Anh Yêu Em English Version) - Phan Đinh Tùng, Mr.M

Night goes down I’m sitting here alone.
Remembering your love
All the times we share are far away.
Why did you have to go away ?
Days go by, shadows fade away
Our flamin' love’s just gone
But if in my soul, I want you back.
Oh my love, will you come in back?
Although our love seemed to appear within thin air
Although our promise meant to shatter into pieces
Although our prayer failed to keep in us in whole.
Although the pain had me cold ?????
Please tell me in this life I’m the only one you love
Please tell me in this life only our love revealed
Please tell me in this life your love is ever mine
Forever our love shadows.
                        
                    |
