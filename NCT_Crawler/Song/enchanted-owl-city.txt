Owl City- Enchanted Lyrics (cover/reply to Taylor Swift’s song)

There I was again tonight forcing laughter, faking smiles
Same old tired, lonely place
Walls of insincerity
Shifting eyes and vacancy vanished when I saw your face
All I can say is it was enchanting to meet you

Your eyes whispered “have we met?”
Across the room your silhouette starts to make it’s way to me
The playful conversation starts
Counter all your quick remarks like passing notes in secrecy
All I can say is it was enchanting to meet you
Oh Taylor I was so enchanted to meet you too

This night is sparkling, don’t you let it go
I’m wonderstruck, blushing all the way home
I’ll spend forever wondering if you knew
I was enchanted to meet you too

The lingering question kept me up
2AM, who do you love?
I wondered till I’m wide awake
Now I’m pacing back and forth, wishing you were at my door
I’d open up and you would say,
Hey it was enchanting to meet you
Oh Taylor I was so enchanted to meet you too

This night is sparkling, don’t you let it go
I’m wonderstruck, blushing all the way home
I’ll spend forever wondering if you knew
I was enchanted to meet you too


This is me praying that this was the very first page
Not where the story line ends
My thoughts will echo your name until I see you again
These are the words I held back as I was leaving too soon
I was enchanted to meet you too
Please don’t be in love with someone else
Please don’t have somebody waiting on you
Please don’t be in love with someone else
Please don’t have somebody waiting on you

This night is sparkling, don’t you let it go
I’m won
                        
                    |
