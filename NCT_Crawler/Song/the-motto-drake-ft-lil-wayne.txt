                        [Drake:]
I’m the *in man, you don’t get it do ya?
Type of money everybody acting like they knew ya
Go Uptown, New York City Biiitch
Some Spanish girls love me like I’m Aventura
Tell Uncle Luke I’m out in Miami too
Clubbing hard, *in’ women ain’t much to do

Wrist blang, got a condo up in Biscayne
Still getting brain from a thang, ain’t * changed
How you feel? how you feel? how you feel?
Twenty five sittin’ on 25 mil uhh
I’m in the building and I’m feeling myself
Rest in peace Mac Dre, I’mma do it for the Bay, okay
Getting paid well holla whenever that stop
My team good, we don’t really need a mascot
Tell Tune “light one, pass it like a relay”
YMCMB you niggas more YMCA
Me, Freddie, Marley Marl at the cribbo
Shout goes out to Niko, Jay and Chubbo, shout to Gibo
We got Santa Margarita by the liter
She know even if I'm *in with her, I don’t really need her
Aohhh, That’s how you feel man?
That’s really how you feel?
Cause the pimpin’ ice cold, all these bitches wanna chill
I mean maybe she won’t
Then again maybe she will
I can almost guarantee she know the deal,
Real nigga what's up?

[Drake - Chorus:]
Now she want a photo
You already know though
You only live once: that’s the motto nigga YOLO and
We bout it every day, every day, every day
Like we sittin’ on the bench, nigga we don’t really play
Every day, every day, * what anybody say
Can’t see 'em 'cause the money in the way
Real nigga what's up?

[Lil Wayne:]
One, time * one time
I’m calling niggas out like the umpire
Seven, grams in the blunt
Almost drowned in her pussy so I swam to her butt
It’s Eastside, we in this bitch
Wish a nigga would like a tree in this bitch
And if a leaf fall put some weed in that bitch
That’s my MO add a B to that *
I’m *ed up, torn down
