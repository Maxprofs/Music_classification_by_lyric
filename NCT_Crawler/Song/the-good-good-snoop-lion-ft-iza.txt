                        Days like these are days I love
 Runnin round going nowhere
 Glad I get to steal all your time
 Smilin cuz I know that Im the one that makes you smile
 Love the way you say my name
 And how you laugh at all the stupid things I say
 Its all lovin, no hate
 Hangin with you while you're hangin hangin on my arm (And I like it)
 Your hand on my back while we drivin drivin in my car (And I like it) (Chorus)
 This is the good good
 This is what people look all their lives to find
 And baby we found it
 Right on time
 This is the good good
 And now that we got it
 We gotta keep it going strong going strong
 Gotta keep it going on yeah
 Keep it strong keep it keep it going on yeah
 Keep it strong keep it keep it going on yeah Anytime Im feeling alone
 Therell be a text from you on my phone
 Just to say youre thinking of me
 And when we are apart I know its only me you see
 Love the way you have my back
 And how when I make no sense
 You still understand
 When nobody else can
 Hangin with you
 While you're hangin hangin on my arm (And I like it)
 Your hand on my hand while we kissin kissin in the dark (And I like it) (Chorus) Oh this love
 Is the best drug there could ever be
 And I get high on you and me
 Anyone can see This is the good good
 This is the good good
 This is what people look all their lives to find
 And baby we found it
