                        You took my heart and you held it in your mouth 
And, with a word all my love came rushing out 
And, every whisper, it's the worst, emptied out by a single word 
There is a hollow in me now 

So I put my faith in something unknown 
I'm living on such sweet nothing 
But I'm trying to hope with nothing to hold 
I'm living on such sweet nothing 
And it's hard to learn 
And it's hard to love 
When you're giving me such sweet nothing 
Sweet nothing, sweet nothing 
You're giving me such sweet nothing 

[Beat break] 
It isn't easy for me to let it go 
Cause 
I've swallow every single word 
And 
Every whisper, every sigh 
Eats away at this heart of mine 
And there is a hollow in me now 

So I put my faith in something unknown 
I'm living on such sweet nothing 
But I'm trying to hope with nothing to hold 
I'm living on such sweet nothing 
And it's hard to learn 
And it's hard to love 
When you're giving me such sweet nothing 
Sweet nothing, sweet nothing 
You're giving me such sweet nothing 

[Beat break] 
And it's not enough 
To tell me that you care 
When, we both know the words are empty air 
You give me nothing 

Uoooh 
Uoooh 
Uoooh 
Nothing 

[Beat break] 
Uoooh 
Uoooh 
Uoooh 

Sweet Nothing 

Uoooh 
Uoooh 
Uoooh 
Sweet Nothing
