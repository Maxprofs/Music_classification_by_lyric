                        See today, I'm havin' one of them days where
 I just don't wanna be bothered
 But it seems like you can't understand that
 Because it's your way or no way
 But check this out, it's my way today And I'm really, really sick and tired
 If you steppin' into my little box
 When I just don't wanna be bothered, okay?
 So check this out I've had my way
 And I've had my share of ups and down
 I've been in trouble
 And I couldn't tell my ups from downs I've been your baby
 And I don't know why
 It don't seem like that no more
 Welcome to this new definition of love It ain't all roses, hey
 Flowers and posin', hey
 Said it ain't all candy, hey
 This love stuff is demanding, hey Said it ain't all roses, hey
 Flowers and posin', hey
 Said it ain't all candy, hey
 This love stuff is demanding, hey
 Sometimes I need a hug See, you, you, you just, you just wanna
 Really, really, really push all my buttons
 'Cause you Mr. Right and I'm Mrs. Wrong
 But right now today, I feel like I'm
 I'm the one gon' sing this song I'ma be Mrs. Right today
 It's my way or the highway
 But with you there's just no gettin' around that
 I gotta be bumpin' heads with you
 What's up with that? Listen, see I love my man
 And I know my place, I know my worth
 And I just can't stand
 To see myself as I hurt It's been a long time and I think that
 I can get a little more love from you
 I know some of ya'll
 Go through it too 'cause It ain't all roses, hey
 Flowers and posin', hey
 Said it ain't all candy, hey
 This love stuff is demanding, hey Said it ain't all roses, hey
 Flowers and posin', hey
 Said it ain't all candy, hey
 This love stuff is demanding
 Sometimes I need a hug Sometimes I just wish you just
 Put your arms around me
 When I'm feelin' so, so, so very needy
 But instead you just turn your back
 And say, "Suck it up" Oh, you don't know how I'm feelin' right now
 If you knew how I feel on the inside
 You wouldn't say suck it up
 Now what the, 'cause It ain't all roses, hey
 Flowers and posin', hey
 Said it ain't all candy, hey
 This love stuff is demanding, hey Said it ain't all roses, hey
 (Ain't all roses)
 Flowers and posin', hey
 (Flowers and posin') Said it ain't all candy, hey
 This love stuff is demanding
 Sometimes I need a hug Well, it ain't all roses, you know?
 Everybody ask me how good it is
 It's great, this love is great
 But when you just a mess yourself
 It ain't gon' be all roses 'Cause you just want your time, you wanna be selfish
 You know, you don't want nobody messin' with you
 You just wanna rip somebody's head off
 When they tryin' to step to you with some
 "Oh you need some help, oh, you need to figure it out You figure it out, you figure it out
 You go figure it out, you suck it up
