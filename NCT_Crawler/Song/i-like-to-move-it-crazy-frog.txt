AND I REMEMBER THINGS CHANGED A LOT IN THOSE 
DAYS, IN MADAGASCAR IT WASNT SO COMMERCIAL, YOU KNOW, 
THERE WASNT ALL THE FUSS BOUT WHO'S GOT THE LATEST TREE 
AND WHAT LEAVES 
ARE YOU WEARING AND WHO'S GOT 
THE LATEST FUR ON THEIR BACK YOU KNOW, 
THOSE DAYS IT WAS JUST ME AND A COUPLE OF THE OTHERS YOU 
KNOW, DOING THE JUNGLE BOOGIE YOU KNOW, 
JUNGLE BOOGIE... JUNGLE BOOGIE 
WOAH WOAH WOAH WOAH WOAH WOAH WOAH
