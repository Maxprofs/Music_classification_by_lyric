                        I Don't Wanna Be A Busdrive
All My Life
I'm Gonna Pack My Bags And Leave This Town
Grab A Flight
Fly Away On Venga Airways
Fly Me High
Ibiza Sky

I Look Up At The Sky
And I See The Clouds
I Looked Down At The Ground
And I See The Rainbow Down The Drain
Fly Away On Venga Airways
Fly Me High
Ibiza Sky

Whoah! We're Going To Ibiza
Whoah! Back To The Island
Whoah! We're Gonna Have A Party
Whoah! In The Mediterranean Sea

Far Away From This Big Town
And The Rain
It's Really Very Nice To Be
Home Again
Fly Away On Venga Airways
Fly Me High, Ibiza Sky

Whoah! We're Going To Ibiza
Whoah! Back To The Island
Whoah! We're Gonna Have A Party
Whoah! In The Mediterranean Sea

Thank You For Flying Venga Airways
We Are Now Approaching Ibiza Airport
As You Can See The Sky Is Blue
And The Beach Is Waiting For You

Whoah! We're Going to Ibiza
Whoah! Back To The Island
Whoah! We're Gonna Have A Party
Whoah! In The Mediterranean Sea

Whoah! We're Going To Ibiza
Whoah! Back To The Island
Whoah! We're Gonna Have A Party
Whoah! In The Mediterranean Sea
