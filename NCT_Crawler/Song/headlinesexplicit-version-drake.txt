                        [Verse 1]
 I might be too strung out on compliments
 Overdosed on confidence
 Started not to give a *** and stop fearing the consequence
 Drinking every night because we
 Drink to my accomplishments
 Faded way too long, I'm floating in and out of consciousness
 And they saying I'm bad, I agree with that
 I took my time with all this ***
 I still believe in that
 I had someone tell me I fell off, ooh I needed that
 And that they want to see me pick it back up
 Well, where'd I leave it at?
 I know I exaggerated things, now I got it like that
 Stuff my napkin in my shirt cause I'm just mobbing like that
 You know good and well that you don't want a problem like that
 You going to make someone around me catch a body like that
 No, don't do it, please don't do it
 Cause one of us goes in, and we all go through it
 And Drizzy got the money, so Drizzy going to pay it
 Told my brothers, I am not even got to say it
 That's just something they know
 They know, they know, they know
 They know, they know, they know

 [Chorus]
 That the real is on the rise
 *** them other guys
 I even gave them a chance to decide
 Now, that's something they know
 They know, they know, they know

 [Verse 2]
 I be yelling out money over everything
 Money on my mind. Then she want to ask
 When it got so empty. Tell her I apologize
 Happened over time. She said she miss the old drake
 Girl, don't tempt me...
 If they don't get it, they will be over you
 That new *** that you got is overdue
 You better do what you supposed to do
 I'm like "why I got to be all that?"
 But still, I can't deny the fact
 That it's true, listening to you expressing all them feelings
 Soap opera rappers, all these niggas sound like all my children
 And that's who you thinking is about to come and make a killing
 I guess it really is just me, myself and all my millions
 You know that they have not even got it like that
 You going to hype me up and make me catch your body like that
 Cause I live for this, it isn't just a hobby like that
 When they get my *** and play it, I did not even got to say it
 They know. They know, they know, they know
 They know, they know, they know

 [Chorus]
 That the real is on the rise
 *** them other guys, and I even gave them
 A chance to decide, now that's something they know
 They know, they know, they know

 [Outro]
 I be yelling out: money over everything, money on my mind
 Tell them I apologize, happened over time
 They know
                        
                    |
