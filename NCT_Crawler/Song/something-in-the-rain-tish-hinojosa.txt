                        Mom and Dad have worked the fields
 I don't know how many years
 I'm just a boy but I know how
 And go to school when work is slow We have seen our country's roads
 Bakersfield to Illinois
 And when troubles come our way
 Oh yeah, I've seen my daddy pray There's something wrong with little sister
 I hear her crying by my side
 Mama's shaking as she holds her
 We try to hold her through the night And Mom says, Close you eyes, mijito
 Dream of someplace far from here
 Like the pictures in your schoolbooks
 Someday you can take us there There must be something in the rain
 I'm not sure just what that means
 Abuelita talks of sins of man
 Of dust that's in our hands There must be something in the rain
 Well, what else could cause this pain
 Those airplanes cure the plants so things can grow
 Oh no, it must be something in the rain Little sister's gone away
 Mama's working long again
 And me, I think I understand
 About our life, about our land Well, talkers talk and dreamers dream
 I will find a place between
 I'm afraid but I believe
 That we can change these hurting fields 'Cause there's something in the rain
 But there's more here in our hands
 'Buelita's right about the sins of man
 Who's profits rape the land And the rains are pouring down
 From the growers to the towns
 And until we break the killing chains
 There's something in the rain
