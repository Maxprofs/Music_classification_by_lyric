                        Bài hát: Left....Right? - Jordin Sparks

I wanna know..
Standing outside the door, why are we fighting?
You don't like when I'm inpatient so you won't
No you won't say a lot
But I've given all that I got
Got your name all over my heart
Great Love, that's what we've got
Started planning our life
And we can't throw it all away (no no no no)
But I still love you crazy
And I will until there's nothing Left, Right?
I'll find my way back to you
That's what you said before you Left, Right?
I was the one you run to
The only one that you had Left, Right?
I gave all my love to you
I'm trying till there's nothing Left, Right (Right)
(Right)
