                        Bài hát: E.z. - BlackBear, Machine Gun Kelly

[Intro: Blackbear]
Beartrap trap music

[Verse 1: Blackbear]
I don't need love, instant gratification
Cut, copy, and paste 'til the colors are all faded
I don't mean half the mean *** that I say
It's like how I know you *** every dude on your summer playlist
Want you to want me for more than vacations and cars that go fast
Mansions, mounds of cocaine, and
What's inside my heart is often mistaken
Like hotel room temperature, distant and vacant

[Pre-Chorus: Blackbear]
I'm filled up with love, I don't want no one to take it
'Cause I've been *** up since the last time I gave it
Don't tell me you love me, don't say it to say it
Don't ask me who hurt me 'cause the story keeps changin'

[Chorus: Blackbear]
Miss you, sex on the couch, it was cool, it was basic
Miss you, flyin' you out on an every week basis
What's changin'?
Maybe I'm *** up, maybe it's love
I wanna regret you, I can't give you up
Baby, I'm *** up, maybe it's love
I wanna forget you, it'd be easier that way
(It's easier that way, oh, it's easier that way, oh)
