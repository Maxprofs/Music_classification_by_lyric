                        Bài hát: On Rainy Days - Tiên Cookie

Girl I know that it's been so long
And I admit that I was wrong
The one at fault was me
But I can't seem to run away
Thinking 'bout it every day
I can't forget these memories

Though I shouldn't be surprised
There's teardrops forming in my eyes
Why did I
Sit there and watch you walk away
I thought that time would help me heal
All this pain I have to feel
But I'll always remember the days

When the rain starts falling
You are here with me
Through the night you are all I see
But as I come closer
You would disappear
So I know that you were never really here

Although I have tried so hard
You had to leave me in the dark
Now we are
Strangers a thousand miles apart
I thought these rainy nights would flush
All these memories of us
But I'll always remember because

When the rain starts falling
You are by my side
And I'm left with no place to hide
All the pain I suffered
Never goes away
I'm reminded of you on the rainy days

I just don't know
How we just fell apart so suddenly
Now there's nowhere in your heart for me
I know that it's my fault I was
So blinded from this pride
Now I'm left here alone in the night
                        
                    |
