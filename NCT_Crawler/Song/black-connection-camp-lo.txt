 Volume 1 of this joint I ski in Switzerland down in Morocco gamblin', handlin'
 B.I. for my crooks back in the BX, sex, collect wines
 Italian designs, quicksilver come paint the canvas if needed
 But should it be not, 'cause everything goes accordin' to plan Yo killin' em softly makin' em cop plea
 Blessin' the black leaf stakin' with 40 thieves
 Now diggy bruh time to conjugate on my delegates
 Shikaka, all of bo daggin', from the tri-borough In they dime, Lita named sunshine
 The lower for Lana diggy now rockin' his pocket flo the mass that
 Hackensack, highway to Holly for this cashmere
 Satin pro, got the Somali, rolls on my mind In France I dance by the moon
 Sailin' from Cancun, steamin' Vega's lace
 Limpin' with some delegates that put me on
 Capridi scarf around my neck, little red corvette
 We got some merchandise to heist up in Canada we move

 Black connection
 All the tri-borough got the back of black connection She scored me up, told me rolls are dyin'
 Wired geechie suede be right there for this caravan, to relieve the bread
 Harlem brook bx catch the character that snatched the goods
 Huggy bear put me on to the will on it hit the gas I got the wire ignored it, then poured it real slow in tekida's glass
 Her radiance, radiance smilin', diamonds giorgio splash
 The Suede is aroused and caress and Caribbean gems
 The squeezin' of jizza is stimulated now on my bend Lent symphonies, left a crystal rock I copped at Tiffany's
 She sniffed her arm, let her hair down and paced the balcony
 I scraped the well
 Dada have her on the score for years, but backed into hawk
 Who pullin' shiest manuevers on my camp, yeah I don't understand, what the *** is up, where my man
 Eat a bowl of hot cock, now Sonny Cheeba volume one
 Catch the mighty bullion cat, comin' out the door, what what

 Black connection
 Got the bronx Brooklyn and the Harlem
 Black connection
 All the tri-borough got the back of black connection My huggy bear connect, connect
 Me cautious, I enter a flamin' scorch, you by the door, moolah
 All over the floor time to gather
 As much as I can tryin' not to get blam off in a vicious
 Get message to Cheeba, in need of assistance right now Then I get the rumble on the hip, I hit her fuzz
 Gotta split, give my peeps who wants sober
 Suede in town, bridge bound
 See the shiesty eyes, filled in double O This is it, through the corridor hit the floor, time y'all pack it up
 What y'all laughin' at loose cannons, blaze my hathaway
 Shake a leg, into the hallway, vision Geechie Suede
 Coolie high cats back to back, 'bout to see the gates
 Twist of fate, ease up into the room, let the guns play Avoid the penal in jeopardy with no ammo to blow
 But me and my a-c goin' out in less than zero, oh no
 Now here come the crooks paradin' by storm with the luegers and oar
 We conquer ground as usual Lo empire can never fall Yeah callin' up the diamond delegates
