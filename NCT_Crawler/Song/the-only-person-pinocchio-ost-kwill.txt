Engsub:

When I look into your eyes, my trembling heart flutters
When I look at you, I feel like the world has stopped

Just like how winter passes and spring comes
I believe you will come to me as well

My one and only person
My treasure-like person who is like a dream
My first person who blossoms like a flower
Just looking at you makes me tear

When I try to write a poem
I can only write your name

Just like how winter passes and spring comes
I believe you will come to me as well

My one and only person
My treasure-like person who is like a dream
My first person who blossoms like a flower
Just looking at you makes me tear

It might hurt and be hard
But I promise to protect you

I only have you
I’ll be okay if only I have you
My first person, the only one in my life
Just looking at you makes me tear
