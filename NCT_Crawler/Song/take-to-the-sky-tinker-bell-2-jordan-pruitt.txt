                        Bài hát: Take To The Sky (Tinker bell 2) - Jordan Pruitt

All of your life you've been waiting, 
Keeping your feet on the ground.
So much that you've never seen, 
It's just been a dream, until now.
Everyone knows it's your moment, 
The magic you need is inside.
So go out and follow your heart, 
Make all your dreams, come to life.

[Chorus:]
Take to the sky, and fly, through the heavens.
Open your eyes, and soar above, the blue.
Take a breath, and believe, you can do, anything.
Time to spread your wings, and take to the sky.
(Yeahh)

Set on a course for adventure, 
Somewhere beyond the blue moon, 
Go and discover the treasure, 
Where you land's up to you.

[Chorus:]
Take to the sky, and fly, through the heavens.
Open your eyes, and soar above, the blue.
Take a breath, and believe, you can do, anything.
Time to spread your wings, and take to the sky.

[Bridge:]
Find yourself wrapped up in rainbows, 
Tinted with fireflies, 
Being here is paradise.

[Chorus:]
Take to the sky, and fly, through the heavens.
Open your eyes, and soar above, the blue.
Take a breath, and believe, you can do, anything.
Time to spread your wings, and take to the sky.
Open your eyes, and soar above, the blue.
Take a breath, and believe, you can do, anything.
Time to spread your wings, and take to the sky.
(Oh yeah)
                        
                    |
