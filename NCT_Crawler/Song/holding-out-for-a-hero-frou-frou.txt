                        Where have all the good men gone
 And where are all the Gods?
 Where's the street-wise Hercules
 To fight the rising odds?
 Isn't there a white knight upon a fiery steed?
 Late at night I toss and turn and dream of what I need I need a hero
 I'm holding out for a hero 'til the end of the night
 He's gotta be strong and he's gotta be fast
 And he's gotta be fresh from the fight I need a hero
 I'm holding out for a hero 'til the morning light
 He's gotta be sure and it's gotta be soon
 And he's gotta be larger than life
 Larger than life Somewhere after midnight in my wildest fantasy
 Somewhere just beyond my reach
 There's someone reaching back for me
 Racing on the thunder, rising with the heat
 It's gonna take a superman to sweep me off my feet I need a hero
 I'm holding out for a hero 'til the end of the night
 He's gotta be strong and he's gotta be fast
 And he's gotta be fresh from the fight I need a hero
 I'm holding out for a hero 'til the morning light
 He's gotta be sure and it's gotta be soon
 And he's gotta be larger than life
 Larger than life Up where the mountains meet the heavens above
 Out where the lightning splits the sea
 I would swear that there's someone somewhere
 Watching me Through the wind and the chill and the rain
 And the storm and the flood
 I can feel his approach
 Like a fire in my blood I need a hero
 I'm holding out for a hero 'til the end of the night
 He's gotta be strong and he's gotta be fast
 And he's gotta be fresh from the fight I need a hero
 I'm holding out for a hero 'til the morning light
 He's gotta be sure and it's gotta be soon
 And he's gotta be larger than life I need a hero
 I'm holding out for a hero 'til the end of the night
 He's gotta be strong and he's gotta be fast
 And he's gotta be fresh from the fight I need a hero
 I'm holding out for a hero 'til the morning light
 He's gotta be sure and it's gotta be soon
 And he's gotta be larger than life
 Larger than life
