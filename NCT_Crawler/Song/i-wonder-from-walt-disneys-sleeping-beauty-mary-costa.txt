                        Bài hát: I Wonder (From ''Walt Disney's Sleeping Beauty'') - Mary Costa

I wonder, I wonder
I wonder why each 
Little bird has someone
To sing to sweet things to
A gay little love melody?
I wonder, I wonder
If my heart keeps singing
Will my song go winging
To someone who'll find me
And bring back a love song to me?
                        
                    |
