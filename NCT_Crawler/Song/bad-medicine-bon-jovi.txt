BAD MEDICINE
from《New Jersey》
BON JOVI
Your love is like bad medicine
Bad medicine is what I need(wo...)
Shake it up, just like bad madicine
There aren't no doctor that can cure my disease
(bad medicine)
I can't got a fever got a permanent disease
It'll take more than a doctor to prescribe a remedy
I got lots of money but it isn't what I need
Gonna take more than a shot to get this poison out of me
I got all the symptoms count 'em 1,2,3...
First I need that's what you get for falling in love
Then you bleed you get a little but it's never enough
On your knees
That's what you get for falling in love
And now this boy's addicted cause your kiss is the drug
Your love is like bad medicine
Bad medicine is what I need(wo...)
Shake it up, just like bad madicine
There aren't no doctor that can cure my disease
Bad, bad medicine
I don't need no needle to be diving me a thrill
And I don't need no anesthesia or a nurse to bring a pill
I got a dirty down addition
It doesn't leave a track
I got a jone for your affection
Like a money on my back
There aren't no paramedic
Gonna save this heart attack
When you need (That's what you get for falling in love)
Then you bleed (You get a little but it's never enough)
On your knees (That's what you get for falling in love)
Now I'm addicted and your kiss is the drug
Your love is like bad medicine
Bad medicine is what I need(wo...)
Shake it up, just like bad madicine
So let's play doctor, baby cure my disease
Bad, bad medicine
Bad, bad medicine
(Solo)
I need a respirator cause I'm running out of breath
You're an all night generator wrapped is stockings and a dress
When you find your medicine you take what you can get
Cause if there's something better baby well thay haven't found it yet
Your love is like bad medicine
Bad medicine is what I need(wo...)
Shake it up, just like bad madicine
There ain't no doctor that can cure my disease(wo...)
Your love is like bad medicine
Bad medicine is what I need(wo..)
Shake it up, just like bad medicine...
