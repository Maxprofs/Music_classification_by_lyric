                        It's a shame for they, lost their head
A careless man who could wind up dead
You wear your sin like it's some kind of prize
Too many lies, too many lies
Oh, oh, these words are true, and I'll make you believe
Yeah, ya' fight for air and struggle just to breathe
And you wear your cowardice well
And I will see you ride it straight to Hell "Echoed Hell"

It's written in your face, the shadows of my eyes
When the devil comes to call you "echoed you", it breaks your hurting ties.

The land will break and the seas will rise.
The wind will rage as it burns the sky.
All you beliefs will be broken and torn.
On your final day,
When I'll end it all

Oh, oh... these words are true, and I'll make you believe
Yeah, your time is done and now it's time to bleed
And you wear your cowardice well
And I will see you ride it straight to Hell (Yeah! )
(Some noise) And I will see you ride it straight to Hell...

[Guitar Solo]

Oh, oh... these words are true, and I'll make you believe (Yeah)
Oh, your time is done and now it's time to bleed (Oh, yeah! )
And you wear your cowardice well
And I will see you ride it straight to Hell
These words are true, and I'll make you believe
(Yes sir) And your time is done and now it's time to bleed
Ohhh, you wear your cowardice well
And I will see you ride it straight to Hell
