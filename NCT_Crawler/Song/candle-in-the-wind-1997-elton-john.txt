                        Bài hát: Candle In The Wind 1997 - Elton John

Goodbye england's rose
May you ever grow in our hearts
You were the grace that placed itself
Where lives were torn apart
You called out to our country
And you whispered to those in pain
Now you belong to heaven
And the stars spell out your name
And it seems to me you lived your life
Like a candle in the wind
Never fading with the sunset
When the rain set in
And your footsteps will always fall here
Along england's greenest hills
Your candle's burned out long before
Your legend ever will
(-------- Misic --------)
Loveliness we've lost
These empty days without your smile
This torch we'll always carry
For our nation's golden child
And even though we try
The truth brings us to tears
All our words cannot express
The joy you brought us through the years
And it seems to me you lived your life
lLike a candle in the wind
Never fading with the sunset
When the rain set in
And your footsteps will always fall here
Along england's greenest hills
Your candle's burned out long before
Your legend ever will
(-------- Misic --------)
Goodbye england's rose
May you ever grow in our hearts
You were the grace that placed itself
Where lives were torn apart
Goodbye england's rose
From a country lost without your soul
Who'll miss the wings of your compassion
More than you'll ever know
And it seems to me you lived your life
Like a candle in the wind
Never fading with the sunset
When the rain set in
And your footsteps will always fall here
Along england's greenest hills
Your candle's burned out long before
Your legend ever will

Your footsteps will always fall here
Along england's greenest hills
Your candle's burned out long before
Your legend ever will
                        
                    |
