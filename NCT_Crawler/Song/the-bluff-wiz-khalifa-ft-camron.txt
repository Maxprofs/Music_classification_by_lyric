                        [Intro: Wiz]
I got so much
I got so much
I got so much
I got so much

[Verse 1: Wiz]
Oh, still the same nigga
Still walking all up on your airplane with all my gang members
Smelling like money and champagne
Part of my campaign
I’m *** rich my nigga
Some things I can’t change
Sometimes I swear I be so fly I mean I can’t change
Sometimes I feel I’ve got a couple people I can’t shame
Still rolling weed in a pair of Js
Gettin’ ashes all over my favorite jeans
I ain’t mad my nigga
I am getting paid crib with the maid
It’s all the same ***, different day
Keep hearing ’bout what these niggas doin’
But them niggas gone, and I’m here to stay
(I’m here to stay)

[Hook: Wiz]
I got me a whole one so I'm bout to roll one
As soon as you jump in the ride with me
Now you gettin lifted, and you feelin’ different
As soon as you want you can drive you'll see
I got so much
(yeah, yeah)
I got so much
(yeah, yeah)
I got so much
I got so much

[Verse 2: Cam’ron]
I told her leave and die or she can stay and breathe
She looked and said, Cam you don’t know what to say to me (Oh really?)
Paparazzi out baby girl, no playing please
Now point that camera at my pockets cause they saying “cheese”
Put up yo life in gambling, next time we out here scrambling
I’m Killa, he Wiz, but all our checks say Cameron
Next chapter, next chapter, f-f-f-fatigues and cannons
Fresh rapper, fresh rapper right here where I’m standing
You play? We playin’
Drive by on the way that waving
New five, that’s how we playin’
We that wave, I’m just saying
What you sayin’? What I’m sayin?
Money, hoes, clothes, and mayhem
Amen! Please have her on her knees, and she ain't prayin

[Hook]
