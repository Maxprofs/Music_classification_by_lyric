                        This is the end
Hold your breath and count to ten
Feel the earth move and then
Hear my heart burst again
For this is the end
I've drowned and dreamt this moment
So overdue, I owe them
Swept away, I'm stolen

Let the sky fall, when it crumbles
We will stand tall
And face it all together
Let the sky fall, when it crumbles
We will stand tall
And face it all together
At sky fall
At sky fall

Skyfall is where we start
A thousand miles and poles apart
Where worlds collide and days are dark
You may have my number, You can take my name
But you'll never have my heart

Let the sky fall, when it crumbles
We will stand tall
And face it all together
Let the sky fall, when it crumbles
We will stand tall
And face it all together
At sky fall

(Let the sky fall, When it crumbles, We will stand tall x2)

Where you go I go
What you see I see
I know I'd never be me without the security
Are your loving arms keeping me from harm
Put your hand in my hand and we'll stand

Let the sky fall, when it crumbles
We will stand tall
And face it all together
Let the sky fall, when it crumbles
We will stand tall
And face it all together
At sky fall

Let the sky fall
We will stand tall
At sky falls
                        
                    |
