Title: Be The One
Artist: Ne-Yo

Hey, I’m not the one to start no trouble 
I’m not one to throw no salt 
But you standing out here crying 
I watched as that dude drove off 
Assuming that, that’s your man 
Assuming that you’re just fault 
I don’t know the whole story
But assuming it wasn’t your fault 
Baby since he just won’t do it right, oh 
Let me be the one
Let me show you what real love is like 
And do the things he should have done 
Baby since he just won’t do it right, oh 
Let me be the one
Let me show you what real love is like 
And do the things he should have done 

Let me be the one, oohh..

Now I know that you don’t know me 
But hear what I’m talking bout 
Cause when I look at you what I see 
Is worth tryna work it out 
Now I don’t know him so I can’t say that he’s a bad dude 
But is he really trying, I think not 
And all I’m saying is if he won’t make the effort 
Let me give it a shot 
Baby since he just won’t do it right, oh 
Let me be the one
Let me show you what real love is like 
And do the things he should have done 
Baby since he just won’t do it right, oh 
Let me be the one
Let me show you what real love is like 
And do the things he should have done 
Uhu, uh, let me be, what you want 
Let me be, what he’s not 
Let me show you real love 
Cause real love is all I got 
Uh, come on in, out the rain 
Come let me, do it right 
Come let me, change your heart 
And change your life, whoa 
Girl let me be, the one, be the one 
Girl let me be, the one, be the one 
Girl let me be, the one, be the one 
Girl let me be, the one, be the one 

Uh la la, la la la, la la la la la 
Uh la la, la la la
ooh.. Baby since he just won’t do it right, oh 
Let me be the one
Let me show you what real love is like 
And do the things he should have done
Baby since he just won’t do it right, oh 
Let me be the one
Let me show you what real love is like 
And do the things he should have done
oohh.. Let me be the one
