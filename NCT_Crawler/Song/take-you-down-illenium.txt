                        Bài hát: Take You Down - Illenium

[Verse 1]
I didn’t mean to hurt you when I hurt myself
It’s just an empty lie screaming out for help
No, I didn’t mean to scare you
But I couldn’t see that when I went to hell
I was taking you with me

[Chorus]
When I close my eyes
I’m climbing in the dark
Trying not to fall apart
Sometimes I get so high
Falling is the only out I see
And I don’t wanna take you down with me
Take you down, take you down with me
(Take you down, take you down, take you down)
Down with me

[Verse 2]
This life is like a razor
When it cuts I bleed
But it's in my hand
And I'm doing it to me
Sometimes it's like an ocean
And it gets too deep
There's no way that now
You could rescue me

[Chorus]
When I close my eyes
I’m fighting in the dark
Trying not to break your heart
Sometimes I get so high
Falling is the only out I see
And I don’t wanna take you down with me

[Bridge]
You need to let it go now
Before you drown
I know that you won't understand
You need to let go of these hands
Cause I'm going now
And I don't wanna take you down with me

[Outro]
And I don't wanna take you down with me
Take you down, down with me
                        
                    |
