 Glenn Miller & his Orchestra
 Words by Kim Gannon
 Music by Lucky Roberts #1 from week of February 28, 1942 to week of May 2, 1942 Couple of jiggers of moonlight and add a star,
 Pour in the blue of a June night and one guitar,
 Mix in a couple of dreamers and there you are:
 Lovers hail the Moonlight Cocktail. Now add a couple of flowers, a drop of dew,
 Stir for a couple of hours 'til dreams come true.
 Add to the number of kisses, it's up to you.

 Serve it in the starlight underneath the trees.
