                        Bài hát: Sun Goes Down - Bruno Martini, Isadora

Hit you up, late at night
All I wanna is to get high
Feel the wind in my hair
I need to feel alive

Up all night by your side
I'm not preoccupied
Through the dark, feel so good
Now over me and you

And I want you in the summer line
And I need you 'till the sun goes down
I'll be with you in my paradise
'Cause I need you 'till the sun goes down

And I want you in the summer line
And I need you 'till the sun goes down
I'll be with you in my paradise
'Cause I need you 'till the sun goes down

('Till the sun goes)
('Till the sun goes down)

Hold me close, feel my fire
A heartbeat synced all night
Feel the tides in my life
Kiss me once, I'll kiss you twice

Up all night by your side, I'm not preoccupied
Through the dark, feel so good
Now over me and you

And I want you in the summer line
And I need you 'till the sun goes down
I'll be with you in my paradise
'Cause I need you 'till the sun goes down

And I want you in the summer line
And I need you 'till the sun goes down
I'll be with you in my paradise
'Cause I need you 'till the sun goes down

('Till the sun goes)
('Till the sun goes down)
('Till the sun goes)
('Till the sun goes down)
                        
                    |
