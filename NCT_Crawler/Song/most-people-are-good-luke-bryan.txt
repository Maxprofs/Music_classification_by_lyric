                        Bài hát: Most People Are Good - Luke Bryan

[Verse 1]
I believe kids oughta stay kids as long as they can
Turn off the screen, go climb a tree, get dirt on their hands
I believe we gotta forgive and make amends
Cause nobody gets a second chance to make new old friends
I believe in working hard for what you've got
Even if it don't add up to a hell of a lot

[Chorus]
I believe most people are good
And most Mama's oughta qualify for sainthood
I believe most Friday nights look better underneath neon stadium lights
I believe you love who you love
Ain't nothing you should ever be ashamed of
I believe this world ain't half as bad as it looks
I believe most people are good

[Verse 2]
I believed in streets of gold are worth the work
But I still wanna go even if they were paved in dirt
I believe that youth is spent well on the young
Cause wisdom in your teens would be a lot less fun
I believe if you just go by the nightly news
Your faith in all mankind would be the first thing you lose

[Chorus]
I believe most people are good
And most Mama's oughta qualify for sainthood
I believe most Friday nights look better underneath neon stadium lights
I believe you love who you love
Ain't nothing you should ever be ashamed of
I believe this world ain't half as bad as it looks
I believe most people are good
                        
                    |
