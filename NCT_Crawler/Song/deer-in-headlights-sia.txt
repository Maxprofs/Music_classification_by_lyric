                        Bài hát: Deer In Headlights - Sia

[Verse 1]
Hoping for a miracle
I'm not equipped for this, but I can't move until I choose
I need a crystal ball
I'm falling apart and I can't take anymore
Standing at the crossroads
There's no right answer, no one's brain to pick
Under the spy
There's no escaping, I'm a deer caught in headlights

[Chorus]
I am hoping for a sign
Something bring me right here
Not in a drink, not in a drift
Please see me through metaphors in blue
I'm holding on for dear life

[Verse 2]
Ego, I am a slave to you
You're running the show, my confidence is bruised
Dumbstruck, I'm falling further
Down a shame spiral, I am left in this

[Chorus]
I am hoping for a sign
Something bring me right here
Not in a drink, not in a drift
Please see me through metaphors in blue
I'm holding on for dear life

[Chorus]
Something bring me right here
Not in a drink, not in a drift
Please see me through metaphors in blue
I'm holding on for dear life

[Outro]
Spirit
Please don't abandon me
                        
                    |
