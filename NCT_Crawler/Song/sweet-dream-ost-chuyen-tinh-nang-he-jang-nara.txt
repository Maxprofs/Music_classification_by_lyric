It's gonna be another day with the sunshine 
Hessarun naui changur barke bichugo banjum nunur tossur ten 
Gude misoga narur bangyoyo... 

Ne bore sarjag imachugo sarang handago sogsagyojyo 
Ne morimathen morning coffee hogshi nega kumur kunayo? 

It's gonna be another day with the sunshine 
Hessarun naui changur barke bichugo banjum nunur tossur ten 
Gude misoga narur bangyoyo... 

When we can get together i feel paradise 
Iboda do hengbog harsunun obgejyoo ama gurorkoeyo 
Jigum ne gyothen gudega ijanhayo... 

Nomu hunheso najochado shirho hessodon ne irumdo 
Wenji gudega bullojumyon yepugeman nukyojineyo 

It's gonna be another day with the sunshine 
Gudega narur arumdabge haneyo narur anajulleyo 
Sarang handago marhejurkeyo... 

When we can get together i feel paradise 
Machi nan yonghwasoge juingong chorom sarang badgi wiheso 
Gude mamsoge dashi theonan gojyo 

Jigum isungan naboda hengboghan saramun obgejyo 
Keji anhge hejwoyo don't break it nan ikum aneso... 

It's gonna be another day with the sunshine 
Hessarun naui changur barke bichugo banjum nunur tossur ten 
Gude misoga narur bangyoyo... 

When we can get together i feel paradise 
Iboda do hengbog harsunun obgejyoo ama gurorkoeyo 
Jigum ne gyothen gudega ijanhayo... 

It's gonna be another day with the sunshine 
Gudega narur arumdabge haneyo narur anajulleyo 
Sarang handago marhejurkeyo... 

When we can get together i feel paradise 
Machi nan yonghwasoge juingong chorom sarang badgi wiheso 
Gude mamsoge dashi theonan gojyo

It's gonna be another day with the sunshine
The suns rays shine brightly outside of my window,
When my half-opened eyes are finally opened
I invision your face and it welcomes me...

Your lips slightly brush against my cheeks, as you whisper that you love me
Inside my head is the morning coffee, am I dreaming?

It's gonna be another day with the sunshine
The suns rays shine brightly outside of my window,
When my half-opened eyes are finally opened
I invision your face and it welcomes me...

When we can get together I feel paradise
There's nothing that can make me happier than this,
Yes, that has to be right
Because right now you are by my side

My name, because it was so common, even I didn't like it
But when you call me, I only think of it prettily

It's gonna be another day with the sunshine
You make me feel beautiful, will you please hold me
Will you tell me that you love me...
When we can get together I feel paradise
Because finally, I feel like the main character in the movies,
Receiving love
I was reborn in your heart

Right this moment, there can't be anyone happier than me
Please don't make it break, don't break it, don't tell me I'm dreaming...

It's gonna be another day with the sunshine
The suns rays shine brightly outside of my window,
When my half-opened eyes are finally opened
I invision your face and it welcomes me...

When we can get together I feel paradise
There's nothing that can make me happier than this,
Yes, that has to be right
Because right now you are by my side

It's gonna be another day with the sunshine
You make me feel beautiful, will you please hold me
Will you tell me that you love me...

When we can get together I feel paradise
Because finally, I feel like the main character in the movies,
Receiving love
I was reborn in your heart
                        
                    |
