                        Raindrops on roses
And whiskers on kittens
Bright copper kettles
And warm woolen mittens
Brown paper packages
Tied up with strings
These are a few of my favorite things

Cream colored ponies
And crisp apple streudels
Doorbells and sleigh bells
And schnitzel with noodles
Wild geese that fly with
The moon on their wings
These are a few of my favorite things

Girls in white dresses
With blue satin sashes
Snowflakes that stay on
My nose and eyelashes
Silver white winters
That melt into springs
These are a few of my favorite things

When the dog bites
When the bee stings
When I'm feeling sad

I simply remember my favorite things
And then I don't feel so bad
                        
                    |
