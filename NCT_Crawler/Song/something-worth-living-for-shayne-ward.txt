                        "Something Worth Living For"

I don't wanna leave you here all by yourself
I just wanna let you know I'm there for you like no-one else
I don't wanna drift off to another place
I just wanna lay here in your arms with your hand on my face

So let's not ever tell the moon about the sun
I'll keep hearing love songs, hoping every wrong's undone
It's foolish but we've only just begun
I don't wanna stop this, all my walls are caving in

I wanna give you something worth living for
I wanna tell you this and so much more
My Everything
My universe

I'm so mesmerised by your serenity
Hopefully you'll take me there inside your dreams
Just like autumn leaves I'm falling over you
It's so unbelievable but yet so true

Our imperfections are so beautiful
Right now
I don't even see them
Only diamonds now remain
It's crazy how
Without making a sound
You can make me feel things

[CHORUS:]
All my walls are caving in
I want to give you
Something worth living for
Oh, yeah
I want to tell you this
And so much more
My everything, my universe
You're something worth living for
Something worth living for

[BRIDGE:]
So let's not ever tell
The moon about the sun
I'll keep hearing love songs
Hoping every wrong's undone
It's foolish
But we've only just begun
I don't want to stop this

[CHORUS:]
All my walls are caving in
Give you something worth living for
Oh yeah
I want to tell you this
And so much more
My everything, my universe
Something worth living for
Something worth living for
You're something worth living for
