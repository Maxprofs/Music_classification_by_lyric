                        Tossin' and turnin'
 There's a fever so deep inside
 The fever is burnin'
 And I'm lyin' awake at night How I want you to kiss
 Want your body to move
 And I want you to touch
 Gonna break every rule It can't be wrong to be in love
 It can't be wrong so don't say no
 I have been waitin' for so long
 So can't we do it now? Hungry for love
 Voulez-vous coucher avec moi
 In the heat of the night
 Hungry for love
 Voulez-vous coucher avec moi
 Won't you stay by my side? Tell me that I am just your lovin' man
 'Cause all I want is you
 Would you like to spend the night with me?
 Tell me that you do, 'cause I'm hungry for love Over and over
 My emotions are runnin' wild
 Make me your lover
 Let me take you back home tonight How I want you to kiss
 Want your body to move
 And I want you to touch
 Gonna break every rule I can imagine how it feels
 And we are lyin' skin to skin
 Heaven is just one word away
 So can't we do it now? Hungry for love
 Voulez-vous coucher avec moi
 In the heat of the night
 Hungry for love
 Voulez-vous coucher avec moi
 Won't you stay by my side? Tell me that I am just your lovin' man
 'Cause all I want is you
 Would you like to spend the night with me?
 Tell me that you do 'cause I'm hungry for love How I want you to kiss
 Want your body to move
 And I want you to touch
 Girl, I'm gonna break the rules It can't be wrong to be in love
 It can't be wrong so don't say no
 I have been waitin' for so long
 So can't we do it now? Hungry for love
 Voulez-vous coucher avec moi
 In the heat of the night
 Hungry for love
 Voulez-vous coucher avec moi
 Won't you stay by my side?
