                        Bài hát : Home To Mama - Justin Bieber, Cody Simpson

[CODY SIMPSON]
I don't work hard when it's easy, I put in work when it's hard
Girl I never believed in love, until I had yours
This is more than a season, and I'm not just smart
I'm not afraid to tell ya, that you're the one

The one I wake up thinking 'bout
The one I can run to when I'm feeling down
Life is so good when you're around
Got nobody from the past days, beating you right now
'Cause I take you home to mama, let ya meet my friends
'Cause you don't come with drama, so I want ya 'till the world ends
Love ain't worth it, but I don't feel like I deserve it
You got the pieces, you're my kind of perfect

[JUSTIN BIEBER]
I don't work hard when it's easy, I put in work when it's hard
Girl I never believed in love, until I had yours
This is more than a season, and I'm not just smart
I'm not afraid to tell ya, that you're the one

I'm the one you wake up thinking 'bout
The one I can run to when I'm feeling down
Life is so good when you're around
Got nobody from the past days, beating you right now
'Cause I take you home to mama, I let ya meet my friends
'Cause you don't come with drama, so I want ya 'till the world ends
You're way more than worth it, but I don't feel like I deserve it
You got the pieces, you're my kind of perfect (you're my kind of perfect)

I take you home, home, to mama
