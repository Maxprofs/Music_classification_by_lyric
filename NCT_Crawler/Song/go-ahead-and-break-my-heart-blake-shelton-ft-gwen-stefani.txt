                        Bài hát: Go Ahead And Brek My Heart - Blake Shelton, Gwen Stefani

[Blake]
The sun is setting on your last good try
Here I am again with half a goodbye
Wonder if you’re really gone this time
Just when I’m about to lose my mind
There you are again on my phone
The moon was rising and you’re all alone
Maybe we could just hang a while
Maybe we can make each other smile

Oh no
Here I go

Why don’t you go ahead and break my heart
What are you waiting?
Is it way too hard?
If moving on is what you wanna do
Why don’t you do it, why don’t you do it, baby
You can’t tell me that we’ll still be friends
And maybe some day we can try again
If you really need a brand new start
Why don’t you go ahead and break my heart

I never ever meant to get so into you
Thought I was using you just to get me through
You know I’m broken I don’t trust anyone
Last thing I needed was to fall in love
You got me dreaming got me thinking I got some hope
There is nobody and someone to get to know
But I’m so scared I don’t know what to do
How did you get me so into you

Oh no
Here I go

Why don’t you go ahead and break my heart
What are you waiting?
Is it way too hard?
If moving on is what you wanna do
Why don’t you do it, why don’t you do it, baby
You can’t tell me that we’ll still be friends
And maybe some day we can try again
If you really need a brand new start
Why don’t you go ahead and break my heart

There’s your reasons
There’s your cards
What are you waiting?
Go on and break my heart

You can’t tell me that we’ll still be friends
And maybe some day we can try again
If you really need a brand new start
Why don’t you go ahead and break my heart

Go on and break, go on and break my heart
Go on and break, go on and break my heart
                        
                    |
