                        Bài hát: Sad Movies - Boney M.

He said he had to work so I went to the show alone 
They turned down the lights and turned the projector on 
And just as the news of the world started to begin 
I saw my darling and my best friend walk in 

Though I was sitting there, they didn't see 
And so they sat right down in front of me 
And when he kissed her lips, I almost died 
And in the middle of the colored cartoon, I started to cry 
Oh, sad movies always make me cry (2x) 

So I got up and slowly walked on home 
And mama saw the tears and said, "what's wrong?" 
And so to keep from telling her a lie 
I just said sad movies make me cry 
Oh, sad movies always make me cry...
