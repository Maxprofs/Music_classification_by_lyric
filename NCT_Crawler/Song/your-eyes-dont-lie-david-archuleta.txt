                        I saw you yesterday, it's been a while
You tried but failed at holdin' back your smile
Right then, it's not over yet
I knew, for you, you see

I couldn't sleep, I thought of nothin' else, I needed help
Everyone was tellin' me,you were movin' on with someone else
But what we had was so special, people can be jealous, oh
I had to see it for myself

I can see it in your eyes
You feel the same about us as I
There is no way the truth can be disguised
You're still in love with me
You were never really out of love with me
Your eyes don't lie

I know I hurt ya, I know you are hurtin' still, yeah
But I'll make it up to you, yeah, baby, I will
'Cause what we had was so special, you know we can't give it up
Now that I'ma lookin' at you, I can see

I can see it in your eyes
You feel the same about us as I
There is no way the truth can be disguised
You're still in love with me
You were never really out of love with me
Your eyes don't lie
And they never will, girl

Oh, now that I know
We were apart but your heart never let go
So thank you for showin' me with one look
What used to be and still is a possibility

I can see it in your eyes
You feel the same about us as I
There is no way the truth can be disguised
You're still in love with me
You were never really out of love with me
Your eyes don't lie, your eyes don't lie
                        
                    |
