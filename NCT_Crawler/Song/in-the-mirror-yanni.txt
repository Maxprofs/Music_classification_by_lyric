In the Mirror

Days are coming
Days are vanishing
Look into my eyes do you belive in the day
Changing all the past years?
When you hold the knife into your hands
I want to feel it
I am the owner of every part
Of your thought and sence
Of your thought and sence

In the mirror
Steel by your side
I can see you when
I close my eyes
In the mirror
Steel by your side
When will see you
In the other side

You are trying to control the situation
You are aware it is over
Can you feel it?
I am the air that you breathe
Your sleepless night will be mine
Tell me the truth about your own
When you see your face on the other side

In the mirror
Steel by your side
I can see you when
I close my eyes
In the mirror
Steel by your side
When will see you
In the other side

solo

In the mirror
Steel by your side
I can see you when
I close my eyes
In the mirror
Steel by your side
When will see you
In the other side

End
                        
                    |
