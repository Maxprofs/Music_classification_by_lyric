                        Bài hát: Lit - Steve Aoki, Yellow Claw, Gucci Mane, T-Pain

[T-Pain (Gucci Mane):]
Yeah, boy, you gettin' that T-Pain and Aoki (Gucci)
All of y'all tryna do our ***, you just soundin' like karaoke (Huh?)
Long as y'all gettin' lit (Yeah)
Yellow Claw gettin' lit (Ha)
Long as y'all gettin' lit, let's go

[Gucci Mane:]
It's Gucci Mane in this bitch, and yeah, it's lit, hella lit
Yellow Rollie on my wrist, same color my yellow bitch
I say I ain't got no type, but I prefer 'em super thick
I was born for this ***, you too borin' for the bitch
In the foreign, motor roarin', sittin' on Forgis with a kit
Plus my outfit sick with it just like E-40 and the clique
I'm so spoiled, she don't get naked, it's hard for me to tip
I'm so hard, got 'em runnin' and I just put in the tip

[T-Pain:]
They don't see me
Oh no, they don't see me
Your girl's drawers comin' down
But the hands go up to the ceilin'
I guarantee it, I guarantee it, I guarantee it, I guarantee it
I'm throwin' money in the VIP
I'm ballin' out, so you know it's me
They tell me, baby you were born makin' big noise
Hanging in the street, yeah
I be hangin' in the street, oh lord
I guarantee it, I guarantee it, I guarantee that I'm the ***
If you're feelin' like me, I guarantee it's about to get lit

[Gucci Mane:]
I'm tryna live, tryna hit Club Liv and spend a mil
Who wanna chill with a rich nigga?
Can't wait to pay your bills
Listen here, I just made 20 thousand disappear
See it clear, crystal clear
Just like these diamonds in my ear
I'm tryna live, tryna hit Club Liv and spend a mil
Who wanna chill with a rich nigga?
Can't wait to pay your bills
I'ma put that top [?] *** in your ear, listen here
I just pulled up to the front, trunk in the rear
Gucci

[T-Pain:]
They don't see me
Oh no, they don't see me
Your girl's drawers comin' down
But the hands go up to the ceilin'
I guarantee it, I guarantee it, I guarantee it, I guarantee it
I'm throwin' money in the VIP
I'm ballin' out, so you know it's me
They tell me, baby you were born makin' big noise
Hanging in the street, yeah
I be hangin' in the street, oh lord
I guarantee it, I guarantee it, I guarantee that I'm the ***
If you're feelin' like me, I guarantee it's about to get lit
