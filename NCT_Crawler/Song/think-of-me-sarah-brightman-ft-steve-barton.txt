                        Think of me, think of me fondly
 When we've said, goodbye
 Remember me, once in a while
 Please promise me you'll try When you find that once again you long
 To take your heart back and be free
 If you ever find a moment
 Spare a thought for me We never said, "Our love was evergreen
 Or as unchanging as the sea "
 But if you can still remember
 Stop and think of me Think of all the things
 We've shared and seen
 Don't think about the things
 Which might have been Think of me, think of me waking
 Silent and resigned
 Imagine me trying too hard
 To put you from my mind Recall those days
 Look back on all those times
 Think of the things we'll never do
 There will never be a day
 When I won't think of you Can it be?
 Can it be Christine?
 Proper!
 What a change
 You're really not a bit
 The gawkish girl that once you were
 She may not remember me
 But I remember her We never said, "Our love was evergreen
 Or as unchanging as the sea "
 But please promise me
 That sometimes you will think
 Ah aah aah of me
