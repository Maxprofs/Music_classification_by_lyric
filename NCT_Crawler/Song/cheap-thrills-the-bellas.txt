[Intro]
Up with it girl
Rock with it girl
Show dem it girl (Bada bang bang)
Bounce with it girl
Dance with it girl
Get with it girl (Bada bang bang)

[Verse 1]
Come on, come on, turn the radio on
It's Friday night and it won't be long
Gotta do my hair, put my make up on
It's Friday night and I won't be long

[Pre-Chorus]
Till I hit the dance floor (Bada bang)
Hit the dance floor (Bada bang)
I got all I need
No I ain't got cash, I ain't got cash
But I got you baby
(Just you an me)

[Chorus]
Baby I don't need dollar bills to have fun tonight
(I love cheap thrills)
Baby I don't need dollar bills to have fun tonight
(I love cheap thrills)
But I don't need no money
You worth more dan diamonds, more dan gold
As long as I can feel the beat
Free up yourself, get outa control
I don't need no money
You worth more dan diamonds, more dan gold
As long as I keep dancing
Free up yourself, get outa control

[Verse 2]
Come on, come on, turn the radio on
It's Saturday and I won't be long
Gotta paint my nails, put my high heels on
It's Saturday and I won't be long

[Pre-Chorus]
Till I hit the dance floor (Bada bang)
Hit the dance floor (Bada bang)
I got all I need
No I ain't got cash, I ain't got cash
But I got you baby
(Just you an me)

[Chorus]
Baby I don't need dollar bills to have fun tonight
(Ooh, I love cheap thrills)
Baby I don't need dollar bills to have fun tonight
(I love cheap thrills)
But I don't need no money
You worth more dan diamonds, more dan gold
As long as I can feel the beat
Mek di beat jus tek control

You worth more dan diamonds, more dan gold
As long as I keep dancing
Free up yourself, get outa control

[Bridge]
But I don't need no money
You worth more than diamonds, more than gold
As long as I can feel the beat
Mek di beat jus tek control

You worth more than diamonds, more than gold
As long as I keep dancing
Free up yourself, get outa control

As long as I can feel the beat
Make the beat just take control

You worth more dan diamonds, more dan gold
As long as I keep dancing
Free up yourself, get outa control

As long as I keep on dancing

As long as I keep on
