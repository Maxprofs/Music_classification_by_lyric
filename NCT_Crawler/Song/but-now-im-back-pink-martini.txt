                        My dear Maria
I'm here to see ya
Won't you please, please open the door
I brought ya flowers
Been waitin' hours
Can't stand it anymore

So here's what happened
While you were nappin'
I just went out for a snack
I was feelin' famished
And then I vanished...
But now I'm back

Now he's back
Had a snack
Now he's back

My heart is burning
For that love of ours
Yearning
For that sea of stars
Let me in so I can prove to you
That no one else
Can love you, girl
The way that I do

Oh, how I miss ya
I wanna kiss ya
And hold you close
From dusk to dawn
So let's just make up
And when you wake up
I promise not to be gone

You know I love ya
Dream only of ya
So please, please cut me some slack
I went away
Just a couple of days...
But now I'm back

Now he's back
Cut him slack
Now he's back

Maria, baby,
I guess that maybe
You're still a little angry with me
But it's getting late and
The boys are waitin'
Gotta get something to eat

I better go now
I hope you know now
I love you, that's a fact
Gotta hurry
But don't you worry, babe...
Cause I'll be back

He'll be back
It's a fact
He'll be back
Don't attack...
                        
                    |
