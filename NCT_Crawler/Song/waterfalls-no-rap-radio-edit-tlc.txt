                        A lonely mother gazining out of the window
 Staring at her son that she just can't touch
 If at any time he's in a jam she'll be by his side
 But he doesn't realize he hurts her so much
 But all the praying just ain't helping at all
 Cuz he can't seem to keep his self out of trouble
 So he goes out and he makes his money
 The best way he knows how
 Another body layin cold in the gutter

 Listen to me

 Don't go chasing waterfalls
 Please stick to the rivers
 And the lakes that you're used to
 I know that you're gonna have it
 Your way or nothing at all
 But I think you're moving too fast

 Little precious has a natural obsession
 For temptation but he just can't see
 She gives him loving that his body
 Can't handle but all he can say
 Is "baby is good to me"
 One day he goes and take a glimpse in the mirror
 But he doesn't recognize his own face
 His health is fading and he doesn't know why
 3 letters took him to his final resting place...

 Y'all don't you hear me

 Don't go chasing waterfalls
 Please stick to the rivers
 And the lakes that you're used to
 I know that you're gonna have it
 Your way or nothing at all
 But I think your moving too fast(2x)

 Come on

 I seen a rainbow yesterday
 But to many storms have come and gone
 Leaving a trace
 Of not one God giving ray
 Is it because
 My life is ten shades of grey
 I pray all ten fade away
 Seldom praise him for the seven days

 And like his promise is true
 Only my faith can undo
 The many chances I blew
 To bring my life to anew
 Clear and blue and unconditional
 Skies have dried the tears from my eyes
 No more lonely cries,
 My only bleeding hope
 Is for the folk who can't cope
 With such an endurine pain
 That it keeps them in the pourin' rain
 Who's to blame for tootin caine into your own vein
 What a shame you shoot and aim
 For some one elses blame
 You claim the insane for
 This day and time for falling
 Prey to crime I say the system's
 Got you victim to your own mind

 Dreams are hopeless aspirations
 In hopes of coming true
 Believe in yourself
 The rest is up to me and you

 Don't go chasing waterfalls
 Please stick to the rivers
 And the lakes that you're used to
 I know that you're gonna have it
 Your way or nothing at all
 But I think your moving too fast X2 (faded)
