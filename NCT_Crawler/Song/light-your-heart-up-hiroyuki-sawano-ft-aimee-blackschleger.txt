                        Bài hát: Light Your Heart Up (Vocal: Aimee Blackschleger) - Hiroyuki Sawano

Because you seem feeling down
I've been trying to calm & fade it
But you don't wanna turn around
Teenage is so complicated
Cmon, cmon
Ain't no one who can take your place
Oh baby...please let me see you smiling

It's such a pain in the neck we have homework by tomorrow
I know you're not a person who would be worn out with sorrow
To fly away from your past is not so easy but dizzy

Keep your faith
Raise your lively face
Just get rid of your broken wings
You're strong enough by now
I'll be your spark when you're lost in the dark
And let me be your sun, be your match to
Light your heart up

Light your heart up
If you want to
Light your heart up

Besides you lead a winding road
There're some troubles make you stumble
But you're gonna beat them all
loner girl is hard to crumble
I know, I know
Ain't no one who can touch your heart
But baby...please let me see you crying

You're sort of square
Why don't we ditch that class?
It's time to chili out
I know you're not a person who would get excited and shout
The sky above your thick cloud is not so gritty but pretty

Keep your faith
Raise your lively face
Just get rid of your broken wings
You're strong enough by now
I'll be your spark when you're lost in the dark
And let me be your sun, be your match to
Light your heart up

Keep your faith
Raise your lively face
Just get rid of your broken wings
You're strong enough by now
I'll be your spark when you're lost in the dark
And let me be your sun, be your match to
Light your heart up

Light your heart up
If you want to
Light your heart up

Sing it now, sing it loud
Sha la la...
I'm your buddy all the way
You may thank me day by day
                        
                    |
