                        Bài hát: Moonlight - Ariana Grande

[Verse 1:]
The Sun is setting and you're right here by my side
And the movie is playing, but we won't be watching tonight
Every look, every touch makes me wanna give you my heart
I'd be crushin' on you, baby
Stay the way you are

[Chorus:]
Cause I never knew, I never knew
You could have moonlight in your hands
'Til the night I held you
You are my moonlight
Moonlight

[Verse 2:]
I kiss his fingertips
As I'm wishing he's all mine
He's giving me Elvis
With some James Dean in his eyes
Puts his lips on my neck
Makes me want to give him my body
I'd be fallin' for you, baby
And I just can't stop

[Chorus:]
Cause I never knew, I never knew
You could have moonlight in your hands
'Til the night I held you
You are my moonlight
Moonlight
Baby I'd be fallin'
You're my moonlight
Moonlight

[Outro:]
He's so bossy
He makes me dance
Tryna sit on the back of his whip
And just cancel my plans
Sweet like candy
But he's such a man
He knows just what it does
When he's holding me tight
And he calls me "Moonlight" too
                        
                    |
