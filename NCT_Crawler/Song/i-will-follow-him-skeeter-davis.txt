                        Bài hát: I Will Follow Him - Skeeter Davis

I love him, I love him, I love him,
And where he goes Ill follow, Ill follow, Ill follow.

I will follow him
Follow him where ever he may go
There isnt an ocean too deep
A mountain so high it can keep me away.

I must follow him (follow him)
Ever since he touched my hand I knew
And near him I always must be
And nothing can keep him from me
He is my destiny. (destiny)

I love him, I love him, I love him,
And where he goes Ill follow, Ill follow, Ill follow
Hell always be my true love, true love, true love
From now until forever, forever, forever.

I will follow him
Follow him where ever he may go
There isnt an ocean to deep
A mountain so high it can keep
Keep me away, away from my love

I love him, I love him, I love him,
And where he goes Ill follow, Ill follow, Ill follow
Hell always be my true love, true love, true love
From now until forever, forver, forever.

I will follow him
Follow him where ever he may go
There isnt an ocean to deep
A mountain so high it can keep
Keep me away, away from my love.

Da da da da da da da
(And where he goes Ill follow, Ill follow, Ill follow)
(I know Ill always love him, love him, love him)
(And where he goes Ill follow, Ill follow, Ill follow)
(I know Ill always love him, love him, love him)
