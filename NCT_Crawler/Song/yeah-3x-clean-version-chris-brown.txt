 Out on the floor
 Put your troubles aside
 And start livin'
 Anybody

 Throw away all your problems

 'Cause I, I'm in love with this feeling now and I, I
 Hope That this will last a while
 We should make it last a while

 You like to drink, So do we
 Get my bottles, bring 'em to me

 Somewhere you've never been before
 So take my hand and come with me
