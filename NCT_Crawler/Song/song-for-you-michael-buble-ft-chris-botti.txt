                        I've been so many places, In my life and time
I've sung alot of songs, Ive made some bad rhymes
I've acted out my life in stages, with ten thousand people watchin
But we're alone now, and I'm singing my song for you

I know your image of me, is what I hope to be
Ive treated you unkindly but girl, can't you see
There's no one more important to me
So darlin can't you please see through me
So we're alone now and I'm singing my song for you

You taught me precious secrets
The truth with holding nothin
You came out in front and I was hiding
But now I'm so much better
So if my words dont come together,listen to my melody
cause my love's in there hiding

I love you in a place, where theres no space or time
I love you for my life, cause your a friend of mine
And when my life is over
Remember when we were together
We were alone and I was singing my song for you

And when my life is over
Remember when we were together
We were alone and I was singing my song for you
                        
                    |
