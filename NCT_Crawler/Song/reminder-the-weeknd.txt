                        Bài hát: Reminder - The Weeknd

Recommend play my song on the radio
You too busy trying to find that blue SO
I let my black hair grow and my weed smoke
And I sweat too much on the regular
We gone let them hits fly, we gone let her go
If it ain't XO then it gotta go
I just won a new award for a kids show
Talking 'bout a face coming off a bag a blow

I'm like *** bitch I am not a Teen Choice
*** bitch I am not a bleach boy
Whip game, make a nigga understand though
Got that Hannibal, Silence of the Lambo
Hit the cast so hard make it rotate
All my niggas blew up like a propane
All these RnB niggas be so lame
Got a sweet Asian chick she go low mane

You know man, you know man, you know man
Everytime we try to forget who I am
I'll be right there to remind you again
You know man (pow! pow!), you know man

Said I'm just tryna swim in something wetter than the ocean
Faded off a double cup, I'm mixing up the potion
All I wanna do is make that money and make dope ***
It just seem like niggas tryna sound like all my old ***
Everybody knows it, all these niggas know me
Platinum off a mixtape, sipping on that codeine
Pour it in my trophies, roll until my nose bleed
Imma keep on singing while I'm burning up that OG

All my niggas get it they make money all alone
Rock a chain around they neck making sure I'm getting home
I drive around the globe, make a couple mil a show
And I come back to my city, I *** every girl I know
Used to walk around with a slouch, had a mattress on the floor
Now my *** straight eating all day, tryna lose weight
That good sex, we'll sweat it out, fotel bedsprings we'll wear it out
I ain't gotta tell you cause

You know man, you know man
You know man, you know man
Everytime we try to forget who I am
I'll be right there to remind you again
You know man (pow! pow!), you know man

Why don't you shake something, shake something
For the Don, don't you break nothing, break nothing
Big girl won't you work something, work something
For the Don, don't you hurt nothing, hurt nothing
Big girl won't you shake something, shake something
For the Don, won't you break nothing, break nothing
Baby girl won't you work something, work something
For the Don, don't you hurt nothing, hurt nothing

Cause you know man, they know man
You ain't know man, now you know man
