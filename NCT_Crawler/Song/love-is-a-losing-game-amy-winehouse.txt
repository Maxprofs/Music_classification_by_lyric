                        Bài hát: Love Is A Losing Game - Amy Winehouse 

For you I was a flame
Love is a losing game
Five story fire as you came

Why do I wish I never played
Oh what a mess we made
And now the final frame
Played out by the band
Love is a losing hand
More than I could stand
Self professed... profound
Till the chips were down
...know you're a gambling man
Though I'm rather blind
Love is a fate resigned
Memories mar my mind
Over futile odds
And laughed at by the gods
                        
                    |
