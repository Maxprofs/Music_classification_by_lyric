                        The elevator in the hotel lobby has a lazy door
The man inside is going to a hotel room
He jumped out right after seeing just the very sight of me
He decided he better hike it to the second floor

It's temporary, this place I'm in
I permanently won't do this again
My belongings scattered all across the hotel floor

An hour later I was thinking it over by the snack machine
I thought about you and a candy bar
Now and later now that I've got it stuck between my teeth
I fell asleep to the greatest movie of the year

A man gets lonely for heaven's sake
He's wondering only what did you do today
The world spin around me to old sad song

Well, it's coming down outside like I've never even seen before
I fell into some kind of sorry state
But looking back now I think it's finally time for me to laugh about it
And get my things together and find something to say

Well I feel awful, and I believe
That time gets wasted in this misery
And darlin, I would never want to come back home
                        
                    |
