                        Ooh, oh oh oh, ooh ooh ooh ooh
Ooh, oh oh oh, ooh ooh ooh ooh

You and I go on at each other like we're going to war
You and I go rough, we keep throwing things and slamming the door
You and I get so damn dysfunctional we start keeping score
You and I get sick, yeah I know that we can't do this no more

But baby there you go again, there you go again, making me love you
And I stop using my head, using my head, let it all go
Now you're stuck on my body, on my body, like a tattoo
And now I'm feeling stupid, feeling stupid, coming back to you

So I cross my heart and I hope to die
That I'll only stay with you one more night
And I know I said it a million times
But I'll only stay with you one more night


Try to tell you no, but my body keeps on telling you yes
Try to tell you stop, but your lipstick's got me so out of breath
I'll be waking up in the morning, probably hating myself
I'll be waking up inner satisfied, guilty as hell

But baby there you go again, there you go again, making me love you
And I stop using my head, using my head, let it all go
Now you're stuck on my body, on my body, like a tattoo
And now I'm feeling stupid, feeling stupid, coming back to you

So I cross my heart and I hope to die
That I'll only stay with you one more night
And I know I said it a million times
But I'll only stay with you one more night

(ooh, oh oh oh, ooh ooh ooh ooh)
Yeah baby give me one more night
(ooh, oh oh oh, ooh ooh ooh ooh)
Yeah baby give me one more night
(ooh, oh oh oh, ooh ooh ooh ooh)
Yeah baby give me one more night

Baby there you go again, there you go again, making me love you
And I stop using my head, using my head, let it all go
My truth stuck on my body, on my body, like a tattoo

So I cross my heart and I hope to die
That I'll only stay with you one more night
And I know I said it a million times
But I'll only stay with you one more night

So I cross my heart and I hope to die
That I'll only stay with you one more night
And I know I said it a million times
But I'll only stay with you one more night
