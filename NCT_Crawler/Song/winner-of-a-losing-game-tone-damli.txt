                        Bài hát: Winner Of A Losing Game - Tone Damli

I didn't know that we were those with counted days
Like water they were slipping through my hands
I couldn't stop the time, I couldn't stop the race
We reached the finish line with nothing left to chase

Every piece of me is hurting, every part of me is screaming out your name 
And maybe I'm the one to blame
Should have felt it in the way you held me
Should have realized it's not the same today--yet maybe I'm the one to blame
I'm the winner of a losing game
The winner of a losing game

I kept on running forward not to lose my pace
But soon the tears were streaming down my face
The medal that I carry weighs so heavy now
How could I think that you would ever help me through

The winner of a losing game
Yeah
The winner of a losing 
The winner of a losing 
The winner of a losing game

I couldn't stop the time, I couldn't stop the race
We reached the finish line with nothing left to chase

I'm the winner of a losing game
Winner of a losing game...
I'm the winner of a losing game
The winner of a losing game
The winner of a losing game
Winner of a losing game
The winner of a losing game
