                        With you, 
With you, 
I wish we had another time, 
I wish we had another place 

Now Romeo & Juliet, 
Bet they never felt the way we felt, 
Bonnie & Clyde, 
Never had to hide like, 
We do, 
We do 

You and I both know it can't work, 
It's all fun and games, 
'til someone gets hurt, 
And I don't, 
I won't let that be you 
Now you don't wanna let go, 
And I don't wanna let you know, 
that there might be something real between us two, who knew? 
Now we don't wanna fall but, 
We're tripping in our hearts and it's reckless and clumsy, 
'cause I know you can't love me here 

I wish we had another time, 
I wish we had another place, 
But everything we have is stuck in the moment, 
And there's nothing my heart can do (can do), 
To fight with time and space 'cause, 
I'm still stuck in the moment with you 

See like Adam & Eve, 
Tragedy was a destiny, 
Like Sunny & Cher, 
I don't care, 
I got you baby 

See we both, 
Fightin' every inch of our fiber'cause in a way, 
It's gonna end right but, 
We are both too foolish to stop 


Now you don't wanna let go, 
And I don't wanna let you know, 
that there might be something real between us two, who knew? 
And we don't wanna fall but, 
We're tripping in our hearts and it's reckless and clumsy, 
And I know you can't love me here 

I wish we had another time, 
I wish we had another place, 
But everything we have is stuck in the moment, 
And there's nothing my heart can do (can do), 
To fight with time and space 'cause, 
I'm still stuck in the moment with you 

See like, 
Just because this cold cold world saying we can't be, 
Baby, we both have the right to disagree, 
And I ain't with it, 
I don't wanna be so old and grey, 
Reminiscin' 'bout these better days, 
But convince just telling us to let go, 
So we'll never know 

I wish we had another time, 
I wish we had another place, 
'cause everything we did, 
And everything we have is stuck in the moment, 
Yeah 

I wish we had another time, 
I wish we had another place, 
But everything we have is stuck in the moment, 
And there's nothing my heart can do, 
(Nothing my heart can do), 
To fight with time and space 'cause, 
I'm still stuck in the moment with you, 
Yeah, 
Whoa whoa
