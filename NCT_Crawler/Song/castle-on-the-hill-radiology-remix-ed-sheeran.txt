                        Bài hát: Castle On The Hill (Radiology Remix) - Ed Sheeran

When I was six years old I broke my leg
I was running from my brother and his friends
Tasted the sweet perfume of the mountain grass I rolled down
I was younger then, take me back to when I 
Found my heart and broke it here, made friends and lost them through the years

And I’ve not seen the roaring fields in so long, I know, I’ve grown 
But I can’t wait to go home.
(Beat)
I can't wait to go home.

Fifteen years old and smoking hand rolled cigarettes
Running from the law through the backfields and getting drunk with my friends 
Had my first kiss on a Friday night, I don’t reckon I did it right
I was younger then, take me back to when we found

Weekend jobs when we got paid and buy cheap spirits and drink them straight 
Me and my friends have not thrown up in so long, oh how we’ve grown
I can’t wait to go home.
