I still miss you, baby, after all this time
But if I wait here, will you be there, times two?
I still miss you, baby, after all this time
But if I wait here, will you be there, times two?

I still miss you, I still miss you
I still miss you, I still miss you
I still miss you, I still miss you
I still miss you, I still miss you
(Will you be there, times two?)
I still miss you, I still miss you
I still miss you, I still miss you
I still miss you, I still miss you
Will you be there, times two?

I still miss you, I still miss you
I still miss you, I still miss you
I still miss you, I still miss you
I still miss you after all this time

I still miss you, baby, after all this time
But if I wait here, will you be there, times two?
I still miss you, baby, after all this time
But if I wait here, will you be there, times two?

I still miss you, I still miss you
I still miss you, I still miss you
I still miss you, I still miss you
I still miss you, I still miss you
(Will you be there, times two?)
I still miss you, I still miss you
I still miss you, I still miss you
I still miss you, I still miss you
Will you be there, times two?

Whoa whoa oh, whoa whoa oh
Whoa whoa oh oh oh oh oh
Whoa whoa oh, whoa whoa oh
Whoa whoa oh oh oh oh oh
And I hope you know
That I can’t do this on my own
And, baby, I know I was wrong
But I’ll be there, times two

And I hope you know
That I can’t do this on my own
And, baby, I know I was wrong
But I’ll be there, times two
And I hope you know
That I can’t do this on my own
And, baby, I know I was wrong
But I’ll be there, times two
