                        Bài hát: Daydreamin' - Ariana Grande

[Verse 1]
You walked in
Caught my attention
I've never seen
A man with so much dimension
It's the way you walk
The way you talk
The way you make me feel inside
It's in your smile
It's in your eyes
I don't want to wait for tonight

[Hook]
So I went daydreamin'
With my chin in the palm of my hands
About you, you, and only you
Got me daydreamin'
With my chin in the palm of my hands
About you, you, and only you
Say yes
Say yes
Say yes

[Verse 2]
Now I can't wait
To hold you in my arms
I know I was made for you
And in love with all your charm
It's the way you walk
The way you talk
The way you make me feel inside
It's in your smile
It's in your eyes
I don't want to wait for tonight

[Hook]
So I went daydreamin'
With my chin in the palm of my hands
About you, you, and only you
Got me daydreamin'
With my chin in the palm of my hands
About you, you, and only you
Say yes
Say yes
Say yes

[Verse 3]
And I want ya
That's a fact
And I need ya
Like I never have loved before
Oh I wantcha
Oooh need you
Got to have ya
Like I never have loved before

[Hook]
So I went daydreamin'
With my chin in the palm of my hands
About you, you, and only you
Got me daydreamin'
With my chin in the palm of my hands
About you, you, and only you
Say yes
Say yes
Say yes

[Outro]
Ba dun bum ba
Ba dun bum ba
Ooooohhhh
Ba dun bum ba
