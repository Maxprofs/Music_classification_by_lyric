If I Could Be Where You Are

Lyrics written by Roma Ryan
Where are you this moment?
only in my dreams.
You're missing, but you're always
a heartbeat from me.
I'm lost now without you,
I don't know where you are.
I keep watching, I keep hoping,
but time keeps us apart
Is there a way I can find you,
is there a sign I should know,
is there a road I could follow,
to bring you back home?
Winter lies before me
now you're so far away
In the darkness of my dreaming
The light of you will stay
If I could be close beside you
if I could be where you are
if I could reach out and touch you
and bring you back home
Is there a way I can find you,
is there a sign I should know,
is there a road I could follow,
to bring you back home to me
(End)
