I'll be there - English-version
We been through ups and downs no doubt
so many times we’ve had it out
some foolish things we’ve realized
think back and have to laugh it out

But that’s what makes us so strong
Lo-lo- lovin’ so strong
We roll deep in every way
de-de-de- deeper baby-babe

i got your back believe me
you got my back it’s either way
when rain or thunder comes along
just keep your faith in me

you are so beautiful – beautiful
wo-wo- wonderful – wonderful
see my dream of you and me
began the day we met, yeah!

some people give up what they have
they run-run-run
that aint ‘gon be our situation
you’re the one-one-one

girl you’re my queen in my heart ‘n soul
i’m never letting you go
i’ll be... there!
you know that...

i’ll be there...
spring, summer, fall
winter’s cold
i’ll be there... be there
to protect you my baby

i’ll be there...
all here for you is where i
wannna be

Some haters try to get us down
but they aint got a clue about
our love and how that we belong-long
so-so right it can’t be wrong
they’ve called me dangerous-dangerous
yet they’re killing ki-killing us
we don’t need your shady ways
that negativity, yeah!

some give up what they have
they go and run-run-run
that aint ‘gon be our situation
you’re the one-one-one

girl you’re my queen in my heart ‘n soul
i’m never letting you go
i’ll be there!
you know that...

i’ll be there...
spring, summer, fall,
winter’s cold
i’ll be there... be there
to protect you my baby

i’ll be there...
all here for you is where i
wannna be

my life without you is no life
no one can replace all your
sweetness inside

i’m so down for you
and you know it’s true
you’re my love... oh oh...
