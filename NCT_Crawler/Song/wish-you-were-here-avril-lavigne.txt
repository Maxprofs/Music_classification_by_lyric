                        Bài hát: Wish You Were Here - Avril Lavigne

I can be tough
I can be strong
But with you
It's not like that at all
There's a girl
That gives a ***
Behind this wall
You just walked through it.

And I remember all those crazy things you said
You left them running through my head
You're always there, you're everywhere
But right now I wish you were here.
All those crazy things we did
Didn't think about it, just went with it
You're always there, you're everywhere
But right now I wish you were here.


[Chorus:]
Damn, Damn, Damn,
What I'd do to have you
Here, here, here
I wish you were here.
Damn, Damn, Damn
What I'd do to have you
Near, near, near
I wish you were here..

I love
The way you are
It's who I am
Don't have to try hard
We always say
Say it like it is
And the truth
Is that I really miss.

All those crazy things you said (things you said)
You left them running through my head (through my head)
You're always there, you're everywhere
But right now I wish you were here.
All those crazy things we did (things we did)
Didn't think about it, just went with it (went with it)
You're always there, you're everywhere
But right now I wish you were here.

[Chorus:]
Damn, Damn, Damn,
What I'd do to have you
Here, here, here
I wish you were here.
Damn, Damn, Damn
What I'd do to have you
Near, near, near
I wish you were here..

[Bridge:]
No, I don't wanna let go
I just wanna let you know
That I never wanna let go.
(Let go, oh, oh)

No, I don't wanna let go
I just wanna let you know
That I never wanna let go

(Let go let go let go let go let go let go let go).

[Chorus:]
Damn, Damn, Damn,
What I'd do to have you
Here, here, here
I wish you were here (I wish you were here)
Damn, Damn, Damn
What I'd do to have you
Near, near, near
I wish you were here.

Damn, Damn, Damn (Damn)
What I'd do to have you
Here, here, here (Here)
I wish you were here.
Damn, Damn, Damn
What I'd do to have you
Near, near, near
I wish you were here.
