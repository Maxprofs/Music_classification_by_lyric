                        Bài hát: Drowning Shadows - Sam Smith

Running round,
Chasing hearts,
Chasing bodies,
To fix the past

I don’t know how I reached this place,
So far from heaven, so far from grace
And I run to give in to the pressure,
‘cause I feel like the city’s got the better of me,
All this casual love,
Isn’t what it seems.

And I try to imagine something closer,
And somebody who is good for me,
I’m so tired of all this searching,
Do i, do i, do i, do I go home to nothing?
Or stay out for more?
Give in to someone?
Or knock down my door?
Or drown all my shadows,
Drown them like before,
Drowning shadows, once more


The more I drink,
The more I drown,
I found that thinking,
I wrote it down

The more I rise above it all,
The less I care, about those falls

And I run to give in to the pressure,
‘cause I feel like the city’s got the better of me
All this casual love,
Isn’t what it seems.

And I try to imagine something closer,
And somebody who is good for me,
I’m so tired of all this searching,
Do i, do i, do i, do I go home to nothing?
Or stay out for more?
Give in to someone?
Or knock down my door?
Or drown all my shadows,
Drown them like before,
Drowning shadows, once more

Once more
Once more

Go home to nothing, or stay out for more?
Give in to someone, or
Or drown all my shadows,
Drown them like before
Drowning shadows, once more
