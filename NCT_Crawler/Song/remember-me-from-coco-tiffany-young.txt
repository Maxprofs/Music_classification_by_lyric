                        Bài hát: Remember Me (From "Coco") - Tiffany (SNSD)

Remember me
Through I have to say goodbye
Remember me
Don't let it make you cry
For ever if I'm far away

I hold you in my heart
I sing a secret song to you
Each night we are apart
Remember me
Thought I have to travel far

Remember me
Each time you hear a sad guitar
Know that I'm with you
The only way that I can be
Until you're in my arms again

Remember me (x4)
If you close your eyes and let the music play
Keep our love alive, I'll never fade away
If you close your eyes and let the music play

Keep our love alive, I'll never fade away
If you close your eyes and let the music play
Keep our love alive, I'll never fade away
Remember me
                        
                    |
