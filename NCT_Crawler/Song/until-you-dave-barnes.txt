                        Bài hát: Until You - Dave Barnes

Let's just take our time
There's nothing else to do
What better way to spend the night
Wasting air with you
The moon has won the war
The daylight waits to win
Stay here by my side we'll watch
The struggles start again

[Chorus:]
I need you now and forever
Just stay right here with me
Don't ever leave
Love was kept from me like a secret
And I swore that I was through
Until you, until you

The city settled down
I watch you as you sleep
There's a silent celebration for
Every breath you breathe
Now this all makes sense
You ask company
I left all I knew with the better part of me

[Chorus]

The time it took to find you
I will wait again my baby
The feelings that I feel
With you now yeah yeah

[Chorus]

Until you until you until you
                        
                    |
