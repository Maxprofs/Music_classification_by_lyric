English

In the corner of the cold room, if the sunset came shining in 
Even if I got close to it, I feel no emotions, and there is no betrayl.

Today and tomorrow as well, I am alone. I am sure that is normal 
As we end the day without exchanging a single word.

No matter how much kindness I receive, 
If I don't know warmth, 
It's not, it's not that simple to feel. 
It's the distance of our hearts.

I am balled up small in the corner of the cold room.

I fear things that will change, and I resign to things that won't. 
If I pretend to go with the flow, am I just making a decision? 
Is that it?

I can see the bright world, 
Spreading outside the window. 
With this hand, with this hand, am I able to touch you? 
It's the distance of reality.

Kindness 
Even warmth 
Can I see them 
On the other side?
