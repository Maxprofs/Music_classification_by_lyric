                        Bài hát: To Love Somebody - Bee Gees

Songwriters: GIBB, BARRY / GIBB, ROBIN HUGH
There's a light
A certain kind of light
That never shone on me
I want my life to be lived with you
Lived with you
There's a way everybody say
To do each and every little thing
But what does it bring
If I aint got you, aint got ? 
You don't know what it's like, baby
You don't know what it's like

To love somebody
To love somebody
To love somebody
The way I love you

In my brain
I see your face again
I know my frame of mind
You aint got to be so blind
And Im blind, so very blind
Im a man, can't you see
What I am
I live and breathe for you
But what good does it do
If I aint got you, aint got ?
