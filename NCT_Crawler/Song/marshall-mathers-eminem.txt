                        Bài hát: Marshall Mathers - Eminem

You know I just don't get it. Last year I was nobody.This year I'm sellin records. Now everybody wants to come around like I owe em somethin. Heh, the **** you want from me, ten million dollars? Get the **** out of here 
[Chorus One: Eminem] 
You see I'm, just Marshall Mathers (Marshall Mathers).I'm just a regular guy, I don't know why all the fuss about me (fuss about me).Nobody ever gave a **** before, all they did was doubt me (did was doubt me).Now everybody wanna run they mouth and try to take shots at me (take shots at me) 
[Eminem] 
Yo, you might see me joggin, you might see me walkin.You might see me walkin a dead rottweiler dog with it's head chopped off in the park with a spiked collar hollerin at him cause the son of a ***** won't quit barkin (grrrr, ARF ARF) Or leanin out a window, with a cocked shotgun. Drivin up the block in the car that they shot 'Pac in. Lookin for Big's killers, dressed in ridiculous blue and red like I don't see what the big deal is.Double barrel twelve gauge bigger than Chris Wallace *, cause Biggie and 'Pac just missed all this. Watchin all these cheap imitations get rich off 'em and get dollars that shoulda been there's like they switched wallets And amidst all this Crist' poppin and wristwatches. I had to sit back and just watch and just get nauseous and walk around with an empty bottle of Remi Martin startin **** like some 26-year-old skinny Cartman ("God damnit!"). I'm anti-Backstreet and Ricky Martin with instincts to kill N'Sync, don't get me started. These fuckin brats can't sing and Britney's garbage. What's this ***** retarded? Gimme back my sixteen dollars. All I see is sissies in magazines smiling. 
Whatever happened to whylin out and bein violent? Whatever happened to catchin a good-ol' fashioned passionate ass-whoopin and gettin your shoes coat and your hat tooken? 
New Kids on the Block, sucked a lot of dick.Boy/girl groups make me sick And I can't wait 'til I catch all you faggots in public. I'ma love it.. (hahaha). Vanilla Ice don't like me (uh-uh). Said some **** in Vibe to spite me (yup) then went and dyed his hair just like me (hehe). A bunch of little kids wanna swear just like me and run around screamin, "I don't care, just bite me" (nah nah). I think I was put here to annoy the world and destroy your little 4-year-old boy or girl. Plus I was put here to put fear in faggots who spray Faygo Root Beer and call themselves "Clowns" cause they look queer. Faggot2Dope and Silent Gay,Claimin Detroit, when y'all live twenty miles away (fuckin punks) and I don't wrestle, I'll knock you fuckin faggots the **** out. Ask 'em about the club they was at when they snuck out after they ducked out the back when they saw us and bugged out. (AHHH!) Ducked down and got paintballs shot at they truck, blaow! Look at y'all runnin your mouth again when you ain't seen a fuckin Mile Road, South of 10 and I don't need help, from D-12, to beat up two females in make-up, who may try to scratch me with Lee Nails "Slim ****," you **** right, Slim ****, I don't get * in mine like you two little flaming faggots! 
[Chorus Two: Eminem] 
Cause I'm, just Marshall Mathers (Marshall Mathers). I'm not a wrestler guy, I'll knock you out if you talk about me (you talk about me). Come and see me on the streets alone if you assholes doubt me (assholes doubt me) and if you wanna run your mouth then come take your best shot at me (your best shot at me) 
[Eminem] 
Is it because you love me that y'all expect so much of me? You little groupie *****, get off me, go **** Puffy. Now because of this blonde mop that's on topand this * up head that I've got, I've gone pop? 
The underground just spunned around and did a 360. Now these kids *** me and act like some big sissies "Oh, he just did some **** with Missy, so now he thinks he's too big to do some **** with MC Get-Bizzy". My fuckin ***** mom's suin for ten million. She must want a dollar for every pill I've been stealin *
