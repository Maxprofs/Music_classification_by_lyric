                        When you were born into this world 
Your mom and dad saw the dream fulfilled 
Dream came true 
The answer to their prayers 

You were to them a special child 
You gave them joy every time you smiled 
Each time you cried 
They're at your side to care 

Child, you don't know 
You'll never know how far they'd go 
To give you all their love can give 
To see you through and that is true 
They'd die for you, if they must, see you live 

How many seasons came and went 
So many years have now been spent 
For time ran fast 
And now at last you're strong 

Now what has gotten over you 
You seem to hate your parents too 
Do speak out your mind 
Why do you find them wrong 

Child you don't know 
You'll never know how far they'd go 
To give you all their love can give 
To see you through and that is true 
They'd die for you, if they must, see you live 

And now your path has gone astray 
Child you don't know what to do or say 
You're so alone 
No friends are on your side 

Child here you now break down in tears?
Let them drive away your fears 
Where must you go 
Their arms stay open wide 

Child you don't know 
You'll never know how far they'd go 
To give you all their love can give 
To see you through and that is true 
They'd die for you, if they must, see you live 

Child you don't know 
You'll never know how far they'd go 
To give you all their love can give 
To see you through and that is true 
They'd die for you, if they must, to see you live
                        
                    |
