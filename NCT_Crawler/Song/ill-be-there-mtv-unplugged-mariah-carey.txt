                        Bài hát: I'll Be There (MTV Unplugged) - Mariah Carey

You and I must make a pack,
we must bring salvation back
Where there is love, I'll be there
I'll reach out my hand to you,
I'll have faith in all you do
Just call my name and I'll be there

Chorus:
And oh, I'll be there to comfort you
Build my world of dreams around you,
I'm so glad that I found you
I'll be there with a love that's strong
I'll be your strength,
I'll keep holding on

Let me fill your heart with joy and laughter,
togetherness is all I'm after
Whenever you need me, I'll be there
I'll be there to protect you,
with an unselfish love I'll respect you
Just call my name and I'll be there

Chorus

If you should ever find someone new
I know she'd better be good to you
'Cos if she doesn't, I'll be there

I'll be there, I'll be there,
just call my name, I'll be there
I'll be there, I'll be there,
whenever you need me, I'll be there
(repeats out)
