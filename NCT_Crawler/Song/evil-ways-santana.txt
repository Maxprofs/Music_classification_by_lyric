Lyrics
Youe got to change your evil ways... baby
Before I stop loving you.
Youe go to change... baby
And every word that I say, it true.
Santana
Youe got me running and hiding
All over town.
Youe got me sneaking and peeping
And running you down
This can go on...
Lord knows you got to change... baby.
When I come home... baby
My house is dark and my pots are cold
Youe hanging ound... baby
With Jean and Joan and a who knows who
around
Il find somebody, who won make me feel
like a clown
This can go on...
Lord knows you got to change
Organ Solo:;
(Repeat 2nd verse)
Yeah ... Yeah ... Yeah ...
