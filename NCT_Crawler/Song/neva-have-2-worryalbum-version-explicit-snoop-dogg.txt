R&B/Hip Hop/Rap|

                        Fifteen years
 In da game man
 And I'm still relevant
 It's a blessing
 It's a fine line
 How to keep it cool
 And keep it g
 All keeping a g
 Is keeping it cool
 And all keeping it cool
 Is keeping it g

 1992, d cover hit da world
 And fell in love with snoop
 Doggystyle came out
 It's like I dropped the bomb
 One of the greatest
 Hip-hop records of all time
 I was young, gettin' money
 Livin' wild and free
 Got owned and I brought
 The whole pound with me
 Didn't matter who's around
 I kept it way to G
 Niggaz know
 It was eastside lbc
 Gangsta ***
 That's what
 A Mothafuckin' Gangsta Get
 The one up above
 Didn't like my pace
 I was movin' too fast
 Then I Caught That Case
 Hm, I fought dat case
 Wondered where
 Dda west would be
 If I'd have lost That case
 I slow ma down
 Swimin' with da sharks
 And I almost drowned

 (Chorus:)
 I done made some mistakes
 Long da way
 To become da G I am today
 Who'd ever thought
 I'd make it this far
 Out the hood to be a big star
 And I ain't going nowhere
 Only I ain't ever comin' down
 I'm too high in the cloud
 To ever have to worry 'bout dat

 I'm finally out
 And da critics
 Say they love me
 Cause I went to the south
 Said I wasn't gone shine
 Had me left for dead
 Switch sides
 Now my old boss want me dead
 Dropped the first of the three
 And you said it was weak
 No limit Top Dogg
 The return of da biz
 And from dat point on
 I know what to do
 Don't worry 'bout them
 Just do what you do
 Last Meal was the one
 Who took me off the leash
 Dats da last time
 A nigga gonna eat off of me
 Stack Black after black game
 Mil your soul
 I'm da boss of this bitch
 And I ain't never went gold
 Nigga

 I done made some mistakes
 Long da way
 To become da G I am today
 Who'd ever thought
 I'd make it this far
 Out the hood to be a big star
 And I ain't going nowhere
 Only I ain't ever comin' down
 I'm too high in the cloud
 To ever have to worry 'bout dat

 Boss of da city
 Boss of da coast
 Some otha niggaz
 Try but none
 Of them come close
 They stuck like a silly
 But nothing like a loke
 Da big bow wow
 I kill it with one stroke
 Dats what it's about
 They tryin' a tell a nigga
 What to come out his mouth
 Mothafucka I'm a G
 But first I'm a man
 Freedom of speech
 Bitch is a word you can't ban
 So they blamin' me
 Saying this my talk
 Just some women
 Is hoes like it's my fault
 Hm, damn they lost
 They just don't know
 Ddat a bitch is a bitch
 And a hoe is a hoe
 Let them heaters c***
 And let them leaders talk
 I'mma be smokin Down
 Livin like a boss
 Let them Heaters c***
 And let them leaders talk
 I'mma be smoking
 Down livin' like a boss
 Nigga

 I done made some mistakes
 Long da way
 To become da G I am today
 Who'd ever thought
 I'd make it this far
 Out the hood to be a big star
 And I ain't going nowhere
 Only I ain't ever comin' down
 I'm too high in the cloud
 To ever have to worry 'bout dat

 Too high, too high
 In the cloud
 To ever have to worry 'bout dat
 Too high, too high
 In the cloud
 To ever have to worry 'bout dat
 Too high, too high
 In the cloud

 To ever have to worry 'bout dat
 Too high, too high in the cloud
 To ever have to worry 'bout dat
 Too high, too high in the cloud
 To ever have to worry 'bout dat
 Too high, too high in the cloud
 To ever have to worry 'bout dat
 Too high, too high in the cloud
 To ever have to worry 'bout dat
 Too high, too high in the cloud
 To ever have to worry 'bout dat
 Too high
 To ever have to worry 'bout dat
 To ever have to worry 'bout dat
 No, no, to ever have
 To worry 'bout dat
 No, no, no
 To ever have to worry 'bout dat
 To ever have to worry 'bout dat
 No more, no more, no more
 To ever have to worry 'bout dat
 I'm too high
 To ever have to worry 'bout dat
 To ever have to worry 'bout dat
