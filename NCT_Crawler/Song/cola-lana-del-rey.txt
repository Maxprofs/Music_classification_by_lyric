                        My pussy tastes like Pepsi Cola
My eyes are wide like Cherry Pies
I got a taste for men who're older
It's always been so it's no surprise

Hubby's in the sky with diamonds
And he's making me crazy
All he wants to do is party with his pretty baby

Come on baby
Let's ride
We can escape to the great sunshine
I know your wife and she wouldn't mind
We made it out to the other side
We made it out to the other side
We made it out to the other side
Come on come on come on come on baby

Woah ah yeah

I fall asleep in the American flag
I wear my diamonds
I pledge allegiance to my dad for teaching me everything he knows

Hubby's in the sky with diamonds
And he's making me crazy
All he wants to do is party with his pretty baby

Come on baby
Let's ride
We can escape to the great sunshine
I know your wife and she wouldn't mind
We made it out to the other side
We made it out to the other side
We made it out to the other side
Come on come on come on come on baby

Woah ah yeah

My pussy tastes like Pepsi Cola
My eyes are wide like Cherry Pies
My pussy tastes like Pepsi Cola
My eyes are wide like Cherry Pies
It's always been so it's no surprise
