                        Bài hát: Gorilla - Bruno Mars

Ooh I got a body full of liquor 
With a cocaine kicker 
And I'm feeling like I'm thirty feet tall 
So lay it down, lay it down 
You got your legs up in the sky 
With the devil in your eyes 
Let me hear you say you want it all 
Say it now, say it now 

Look what you're doing, look what you've done 
But in this jungle you can't run 
Cause what I got for you 
I promise it's a killer, 
You'll be banging on my chest 
Bang bang, gorilla 

You and me baby making love like gorillas 
You and me baby making love like gorillas 

Yeah, I got a fistful of your hair 
But you don't look like you're scared 
You just smile and tell me, "Daddy, it's yours." 
'Cause you know how I like it, 
You's a dirty little lover 
If the neighbors call the cops, 
Call the sheriff, call the SWAT ‒ we don't stop, 
We're keep rocking while they're knocking on our door 
And you're screaming, "Give it to me baby, 
Give it to me motherfucker!" 

Oh, look what you're doing, look what you've done 
But in this jungle you can't run 
Cause what I got for you 
I promise it's a killer, 
You'll be banging on my chest 
Bang bang, gorilla 

You and me baby making love like gorillas 
You and me baby making love like gorillas 

I bet you never ever felt so good, so good 
I got your body trembling like it should, it should 
You'll never be the same baby once I'm done with you 

Oh, you with me baby making love like gorillas 
You and me baby we'll be fuckin' it like gorillas 
You and me baby making love like gorillas
