                        Smooth talkin'
So rockin'
He's got everything
That a girl's wantin'
He's a cutie
He plays it groovy
And I can't keep myself
From doing somethin' stupid
Think I'm really falling for his smile
There's butterflies when he says my name

He's got something special
He's got something special
And when he's looking at me
I wanna get all sentimental
He's got something special
He's got something special
I can hardly breathe
Something's telling me
Telling me
He could be the one
He could be the one
He could be the one
He could be the one
He could be the one
He could be the one

He's lightning
Sparks are flyin'
Everywhere I go
He's always on my mind and
I'm going crazy
About him lately
And I can't help myself
From how my heart is racin'
Think I'm really diggin' on his vibe
He really blows me away

He's got something special
He's got something special

And when he's looking at me
I wanna get all sentimental
He's got something special
He's got something special
I can hardly breathe
Something's telling me
Telling me
He could be the one
He could be the one
He could be the one
He could be the one
He could be the one
He could be the one

And he's got a way
Of making me feel
Like everything I do is
Perfectly fine
The stars are aligned
When I'm with him
And I'm so into him

He's got something special
He's got something special
And when he's looking at me
I wanna get all sentimental
He's got something special
He's got something special
I can hardly breathe
Something's telling me
Telling me
He could be the one
He could be the one
He could be the one
He could be the one
He could be the one
He could be the one
He could be the one
