                        Bài hát: A Little Love - Hòa Tấu

Greatness as you 
Smallest as me 
You show me what is deep as sea 
A little love, little kiss 
A little hug, little gift 
All of little something, these are memories 
You make me cry, make me smile 
Make me feel that love is true... 
You always stand by my side 
I dont want to say goodbye 

You make me cry, make me smile 
Make me feel the joy of love. 
Oh! kissing you... 
Thank you for all the love you always give to me, 
Oh! I love you 

Greatnass as you 
Smallest as me 
You show me what is deep as sea 
A little love, little kiss Little hug, little gift 
All of little something. These are our memories 
You make me cry, make me smile 
Make me feel the love is true 
You always stand by my side 
I dont want to say goodbye 
You make me cry, make me smile
