                        The sky turns to a different shade of blue
 After the rain
 Her mind turns to a different point of view
 After the rain Ooh, my, my
 Ooh, my, my
 Ooh, my, my, I know Like the ocean meets the moon to take the tides away
 All we needs a little time to chase the blues away
 Sun is out and it feels like its always gonna stay
 Let this last forever, turn tomorrow into yesterday Now all those clouds have nothing left to do
 After the rain
 And all those doubts have drifted out of you
 After the rain Ooh, my, my
 Ooh, my, my
 Ooh, my, my, I know Like the ocean meets the moon to take the tides away
 All we needs a little time to chase the blues away
 Sun is out and it feels like its always gonna stay
 Let this last forever, turn tomorrow into yesterday Like the ocean meets the moon to take the tides away
 All we needs a little time to chase the blues away
 Sun is out and it feels like its always gonna stay
 Let this last forever, turn tomorrow into yesterday, into yesterday
