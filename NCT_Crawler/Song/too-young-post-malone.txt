                        Bài hát: Too Young - Post Malone

[Intro]
I don't wanna die too young
Yeah, too young, yeah, too young

[Hook]
I don't wanna die too young, too young, too young
Counting bands, hallelujah, 'lujah, 'lujah
I don't wanna die too young, too young, too young
I've been grindin' way too long, too long, too long

[Verse 1]
Came up, don't know, I just keep going with the flow
I just wanna go and cop me somethin'
I hit Fairfax, go shoppin' though
She just wanna hit that bathingroom, hold that guap like a register
Keep on winning, need that guap though
Like I'm cash out, eat at papadeauxs
Flowing on to the Galapagos, running and grab the dough
Man this *** never minimal, feel like an animal
Yeah bitch, I try to keep me cool, your life never going, never going back
Yeah, I don't wanna die too young, I don't wanna die too young
When I get that cash it's hallelujah
Aye hallelujah, aye hallelujah, aye hallelujah

[Hook]
I don't wanna die too young, too young, too young
Counting bands, hallelujah, 'lujah, 'lujah
I don't wanna die too young, too young, too young
I've been grindin' way too long, too long, too long

[Verse 2]
My whip fast, my bitch bad, I skrrr skrrr, that coupe fast
My coupe fast, your bitch know
My bitch slow, she do what I say so and she always keep me on my toes
Poppin' that woe, man I be gone
Just watch me go, bitches they watching me go
Walking around, aye I pick that band up, then I go drop that *** off
Pull up in a Porsche, *** poppin' off
Pop that *** off, I got that bitch off, I tell her to knock that *** off
And I got my nut off and she washed my nuts off
I want that ***, I got that ***, pop that ***
Got rich quick, suck my...
You know it make me God damn numb
When I see 'em die so God damn young
(I don't wanna die)

[Hook]
I don't wanna die too young, too young, too young
Counting bands, hallelujah, 'lujah, 'lujah
I don't wanna die too young, too young, too young
I've been grindin' way too long, too long, too long
I don't wanna die too young, too young, too young
Counting bands, hallelujah, 'lujah, 'lujah
I don't wanna die too young, too young, too young
I've been grindin' way too long, too long, too long
