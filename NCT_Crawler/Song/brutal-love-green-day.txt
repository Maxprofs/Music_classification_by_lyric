                        Title: Brutal Love
Artist: Green Day

Turn out the lights
Close your eyes
Turn up the silence
The heartache of your life

Dance forever
Under the lights
This brutal love

Oh how you want it
You’re begging for it
But you can’t have it
Even if you tried

It’s in the clutches
In my hands of
This brutal love

Old toys
This plastic heart
Loners and fools
Are tearing me apart

Here comes trouble
The uninvited
This brutal love

Danger
Not quite at home
The eyes of temptation
The flesh and my bones

Hello stranger
I’m a disaster
This brutal love

Bad luck
Bitters and soda
Anguish and shame
The modern fool

Bad sex
Buy me a train wreck
Something for my trouble
Mind

Bad luck
Bitters and soda
Anguish and shame
The modern fool

Mad love
Kiss me I’m loaded
Something for my trouble mind

Drop out
Drop-dead hideous
How low is this brutal love?

Drop out
Drop-dead hideous
How low is this brutal love?

Drop out
Drop-dead hideous
How low is this brutal love?

Drop out
Drop-dead hideous
How low is this brutal love?

This brutal love
