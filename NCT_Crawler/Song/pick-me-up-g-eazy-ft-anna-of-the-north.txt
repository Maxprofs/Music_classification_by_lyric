                        Bài hát: Pick Me Up - G-Eazy, Anna Of The North

Cocaine clouds, eyelids peeled
Thirty thousand feet, up's how it feels
Homemade straws, hundred dollar bills
Overflowing cups, 'til the glass spills
Looking down on the Earth, marijuana fields
Uh, synthesize capsules and pills

Hollywood castles, the hills
Do it all, wonder will we live past the thrills?
Yeah, pay the prices for a nice trip
Yeah, vices got me in a vice grip
And I don't even care if I live
Wonder if if I will ever

If you come hit it once, be careful now (be careful now)
'Cause, baby, once you pick me up, you can't pull me down
Think you can leave me forever now?
'Cause, baby, once you pick me up, you can't pull me down
'Cause, baby, once you
'Cause, baby, once you
'Cause, baby, once you pick me up, you can't pull me down

My personality's addicted to it
Pick up a habit and I'm stickin' to it
Yeah, I tell my story and they listen to it
Jackson Pollock paint a picture, see my vision through it
Yeah, when she hit me, I'll be there again
I swear that pussy's like heroin

Used rubbers, dirty sheets, at the Sheraton
Check your pockets for them drugs you been carrying
Hope you got something for the come down
The sun's been up, let's roll a blunt now
Too much Ye, it's no fun now
We all need limits, gotta learn how

If you come hit it once, be careful now (be careful now)
'Cause, baby, once you pick me up, you can't pull me down
Think you can leave me forever now?
'Cause, baby, once you pick me up, you can't pull me down
'Cause, baby, once you
'Cause, baby, once you
'Cause, baby, once you pick me up, you can't pull me down

I live without consequences
When I play with death, I display talent
Outta cash buying drugs, can I PayPal it?
Don't talk about it, she'll just stay sullen
The Beautiful & Damned, tryna find balance
She wants molly, she wants all that

I call once and then I call back
If my dealer don't respond back
The whole world's goin' all black
Yeah, can't handle her, she's out her head
Yeah, and then she looked at me and then she said
"I hope you make it in Heaven for a half hour"
Yeah, before the devil finds out you're dead

If you come hit it once, be careful now (be careful now)
'Cause, baby, once you pick me up, you can't pull me down
Think you can leave me forever now?
'Cause, baby, once you pick me up, you can't pull me down
'Cause, baby, once you
'Cause, baby, once you
'Cause, baby, once you pick me up, you can't pull me down
