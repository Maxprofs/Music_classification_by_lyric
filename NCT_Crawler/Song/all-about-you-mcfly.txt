                        All About You - McFly

It's all about you (It's about you) 
It's all about you, baby (It's all about you) 
It's all about you (It's about you) 
It's all about you 

Yesterday, you asked me something I thought you knew. 
So I told you with a smile 'It's all about you' 
Then you whispered in my ear and you told me too, 
Say 'If you make my life worthwhile, it's all about you' 

And I would answer all you're wishes, if you asked me to. 
But if you deny me one of your kisses, don't know what I'd do. 
So hold me close and say three words, like you used to do. 
Dancing on the kitchen tiles, it's all about you. 
Yeah... 

And I would answer all you're wishes, if you asked me to. 
But if you deny me one of your kisses, don't know what I'd do. 
So hold me close and say three words, like you used to do. 
Dancing on the kitchen tiles, 
Yes you make my life worthwhile, 
So I told you with a smile... 
It's all about you. 

It's all about you (It's about you) 
It's all about you, baby (It's all about you) 
It's all about you (It's about you) 
It's all about you
