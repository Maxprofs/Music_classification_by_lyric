                        I could be staring at somebody new 
But stuck in my head is a picture of you 
You are the thunder, I was the rain 
I wanna know if I’ll see you again 
I said I love you, you said goodbye 
Everything changes in the blink of an eye 
It’s been a while, I still carry the flame 
I wanna know if I’ll see you again 
See you again, see you again 
Want you to know, what you mean to me 
What will it take, take you to see? 

[Chorus:] 
I could put in a stardust in your eyes 
Put a little sunshine in your life 
Give me a little heart to feel the same 
And I wanna know if I’ll see you again 
if I’ll see you again

I’ve seen that before, cause you’re not even there 
I’m writing this song and you don’t even care 
Throw me a lifeline and open my door 
And pick up my heart that you left on the floor 
On the floor, on the floor 
Want you to know, what you mean to me 
What will it take, take you to see? 

[Chorus:] 
I could put in a stardust in your eyes 
Put a little sunshine in your life 
Give me a little heart to feel the same 
And I wanna know if I’ll see you again 
if I’ll see you again

Funny How the time goes rushing by 
And all the little things we leave behind 
But even any other thing i do,
is a little bit of me, a little bit of you 
When will I see you again? 
When will I see you again? 
When will I see you again? 
When will I see you again? 

[Chorus:] 
I could put in a stardust in your eyes 
Put a little sunshine in your life 
Give me a little heart to feel the same 
And I wanna know if I’ll see you again 
if I’ll see you again

I could put in a stardust in your eyes 
Put a little sunshine in your life 
Give me a little heart to feel the same 
And I wanna know if I’ll see you again 
if I’ll see you again

Funny How the time goes rushing by 
And all the little things we leave behind 
But even any other thing i do,
is a little bit of me, a little bit of you 

When will I see you again? 
When will I see you again?
                        
                    |
