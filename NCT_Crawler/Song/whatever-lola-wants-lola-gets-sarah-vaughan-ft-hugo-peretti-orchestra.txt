                        Whatever Lola wants, Lola gets
And little man, little Lola wants you
Make up your mind to have
(Make up you mind to have)
No regrets (no regrets)
Recline yourself
Resign yourself, you're through

I always get, what I aim for
And your heart and soul
Is what I came for

Whatever Lola wants (Lola wants)
Lola gets (Lola gets)
Take off your coat
Don't you know you can't win
You're no exception to the rule
I'm irresistible you fool .. give in
(Give in, you'll never win)

Whatever Lola wants
Lola gets

[Instrumental Interlude]

I always get, what I aim for
And your heart and soul
Is what I came for

Whatever Lola wants (Lola wants)
Lola gets (Lola gets)
Take off your coat
Don't you know, you can't win

You're no exception to the rule
I'm irresistible you fool ... give in
(Give in, you'll never win)

Give in (give in, you'll never win)
Give in (give in, you'll never win)
                        
                    |
