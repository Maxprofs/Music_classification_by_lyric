                        Bài hát: King Of The World - Blue

Take me back to the time
We would talk all night
Those healing words I never heard
Put my world to right

She told me you don't see what I can see
This life is full of possibility
She gave me more than gold, gave me all I need
Without her I'm a poor man

I'd be the king of the world
If you were by my side
'Cause when you gave me your love
I was the richest man alive
Now I'm broken, hopin' you'll come back in my life
I'd be the king of the world
If you were here tonight

Remember when way back then
We'd lie there in the dark
My best friend, you said it would never end
As we looked up to the sky

She showed me how to be all that I could be
Broke into my heart, and set me free
She gave me reason to believe
Without her I'm a poor man

I'd be the king of the world
If you were by my side
'Cause when you gave me your love
I was the richest man alive
Now I'm broken, hopin' you'll come back in my life
I'd be the king of the world
If you were here tonight

Ooh oh oh oh
Ooh oh oh oh
Come back in my life
Ooh oh oh oh
Ooh oh oh oh
I need you here tonight
Without you I'm a poor man

I'd be the king of the world
If you were by my side
'Cause when you gave me your love
I was the richest man alive
Now I'm broken, hopin' you'll come back in my life
I'd be the king of the world
If you were here tonight

I'd be the king of the world
If you were by my side
                        
                    |
