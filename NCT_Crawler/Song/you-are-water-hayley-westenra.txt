                        "You Are Water"

When I'm lost in a tunnel of shadows and fears
with no light, only night.
And I listen for kind words but nobody's here,
oh so blue, all but you.

You are the one voice
that gives me my own voice
oh don't you know?

You are water on a hot summer day
for a thirsty daughter who's finding her way.
You are water, I found my oasis
I'm drinking from the fountain of dreams
You are water.

You hear the melody of my song.
You stop time, heal my mind.
You show me struggle can make you so strong.
Plant the seed, let is sleep.

You are the one voice
that gives me my own voice
oh don't you know?

You are water on a hot summer day
for a thirsty daughter, finding her way.
You are water, I found my oasis
and now I've got my arms wide open,
now we've got my wishes in motion and
I want to thank you, yeah I want to thank you.

Every step that you take...shows me the way

You are water on a hot summer day
for a thirsty daughter, finding her way.
You are water
I found my oasis and now I've got my wishes in motion.

You are water. You are water.
You are water. You are water.
