                        Bài hát: The Herobrine - A Minecraft Parody Of Eminem And Rihanna's Monster - V.A

[Chorus]
You’re afraid of the Herobrine
That's completely un-dead
Keep away from the voices, creeps under your bed
He’s trying to kill you
Stop wishing him dead
You’re going crazy
Yeah, you’re going crazy (crazy)

[Verse 1]
I aimed for the vein, lead to the lack of a heartbeat
Oh well, best killers can't be choosy
Needed to receive attention for my bravery
Wanted to be left alone in darkness excuse me
Been lusting my brains, and eat them too
And flanking in both ways
Flames made you go boom ‘cause you got located
When it blew; see it was amusing
‘Cause all I wanted to do is beat Herobrine the dead beast
Improved it, used it as a tool when I splash speed
Hit the artery (tehe)
With what I strung back was not a mean feat
It was like kicking a bruised king
Demonic 'cause I think I'm getting so evil I don’t think
You’re beginning to lose sleep: one dead, two dead
Seeing postmen and speedy’s like Crazy Craft
But we’re actually scarier than you think
Cause I'm...

[Hook:]
Not afraid of the Herobrine
That's completely un-dead
Keep away from the voices, creeps under your bed
We're trying to kill you
Stop wishing us dead
We're going crazy
Yeah, we’re going crazy (crazy)

Well, they’re nothing
Well, they’re nothing

[Verse 2]
Now, he isn’t usually one to blow it but somebody then told me
To siege with bowmen and don’t blunder it
‘Cause you never know when they could all be dead, the sorrow
So I’ll keep pillaging, sometimes I wonder where these mobs spawn from
(Yeah tree shade’ll do wonders.
No wonder you’re losing your army the way you squander.)
Dream-Yoda-le-hee-hun
I think it went wandering off a Ravine
And it stumbled on Herobrine – inventor of mean
Think I need an interdemiensionist
To teleport between me and this monster
And save him from myself and all this bloodshed
‘Cause they’re very thin and you hate them killing you, but you can’t master it
My skele bones keep bonking you in the head
Keep blocking, defend my throne, I’m battle talking
I’m just replaying what the dark in my head’s saying
Don’t shoot the messenger, I’m not afraid of the

[Hook:]
Not afraid of the Herobrine
That's completely un-dead
Keep away from the voices, creeps under your bed
We're trying to kill you
Stop wishing us dead
We're going crazy
Yeah, we’re going crazy (crazy)

Well, they’re nothing
Well, they’re nothing

[Verse 3:]

They call us crazy but then there’s division
One day I’ll walk amongst them ‘cause I’m an irregular villain
But until then mobs get killed and I’m respawning straight from
MC, blood gets spilled and I’ll
Take them back to rot in the hay stack
Train every kid who’s born that
Pumped up feeling and shoot to slay ‘em, hack
Said every kid who saw me slay him
I ain’t here to save the ******* village
But if one King out of a hundred pillage
They are going through a struggle, feel it and the relay it straight back
It’s payback, Herobrine falling way back
In the shaft, turn nothing into something, still can make that
Stone into gold, chump, I will spin arrows in a foes back
Maybe they need an axe to hack it, face facts
I’m evil for real, but I’m okay with that
Then again, you’re now afraid of the

[Hook:]
Now afraid of the Skele King.
That's completely un-dead
Keep away from the voices, creeps under your bed
We're trying to kill you
Stop wishing us dead
We're going crazy
Yeah, we’re going crazy (crazy)

Well, they’re nothing
Well, they’re nothing
                        
                    |
