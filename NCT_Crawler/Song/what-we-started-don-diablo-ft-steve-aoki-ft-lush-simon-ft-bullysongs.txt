                        Bài hát: What We Started - Lush & Simon, BullySongs, Don Diablo, Steve Aoki

Remember when we were young
Breakin' every rule they made
I'll never change what we've done
It made us who we are today
I takin' every chance I get
To make us who you won't forget
Who we are, who we are

This is what we started
This is what we started
They can't hold us down
They'll never be, never be
Never be, never be us
This is what we started

Remember we used to run
To the corner of 69
Yeah they would come chasin' us
We found a new place to hide
Our makin' out plans to brake out
Give me your hand and then
They will know who we are

This is what we started
This is what we started
They can't hold us down
They'll never be, never be us
Never be, never be us

This is what we started
It's everything that we ever wanted
They won't hold us back
They'll never be, never be us
Never be, never be us

This is what we started
It's everything that we ever wanted
                        
                    |
