                        Bài hát: The Show - Thanh Trúc 

I'm just a little bit caught in the middle 
Life is a maze, and love is a riddle 
I don't know where to go 
Can't do it alone 
I've tried, but i don't know why. 

Slow it down, make it stop 
Or else my heart is going to pop 
Cause its to much, yea its alot 
To be something I'm not. 

I'm a fool, out of love 
Cause I just can't get enough. 

I'm just a little bit caught in the middle 
Life is a maze, and love is a riddle 
I don't know where to go 
Can't do it alone 
I've tried, but i don't know why. 

I'm just a little girl lost in the moment 
I'm so scared but i don't show it 
I can't figure it out 
It's bringing me down 
I know, I've got to let it go 
And just enjoy the show. 

The sun is hot in the sky 
Just like a giant spot light 
The people follow the signs 
And syncronize in time. 

It's just, no body knows 
They got a ticket to the show 

dum de dum
dudum de dum

Just enjoy the show

dum de dum
dudum de dum

Just enjoy the show

I want my money back
I want my money back
I want my money back
Just enjoy the show

I want my money back
I want my money back
I want my money back
Just enjoy the show
