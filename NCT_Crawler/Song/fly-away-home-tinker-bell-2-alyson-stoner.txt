                        FLY AWAY HOME

I always known masic has grown
Along the rivers in hollowed trees
I've seen yoi there, through misty air
Dancing a waitz with the falling leaves
Whispering dell, magical spell
Capturing rainbows on newborn wings

Don't worry if you're found 
I'll never do you harm 
I believe in you, believe in me

Butterfly and fairy sprite
Come to me
If i catch you i'll set you free
Look you over then let you go

Butterfly and fairy sprite
Fly away home
Just look you over then let you go
Fly fly fly away home

Mischievous fun, acorn a drum
Traveling song sailing through the reeds

Rose petal grown, buttercup crown
Lavender blue, you wear upon your feet

I come with open arms
I'll never do you harm
I believe in you, believe in me

Butterfly and fairy sprite
Come to me
If i catch you i'll set you free
Look you over then let you go

Butterfly and fairy sprite
Fly away home
Just look you over then let you go
Fly fly fly away home

Fly away home 

Make your wishes all come true 
When you believe 
When you believe 

Butterfly and fairy sprite
Come to me
If i catch you i'll set you free
Look you over then let you go

Butterfly and fairy sprite
Fly away home
Just look you over then let you go
Fly fly fly away home

Fly fly fly away home
                        
                    |
