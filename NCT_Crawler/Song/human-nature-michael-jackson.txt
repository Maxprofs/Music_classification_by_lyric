Human Nature
Michael Jackson
Looking out
Across the nighttime
The city winks a sleepless eye
Hear her voice
Shake my window
Sweet seducing sighs
Get me out
Into the nighttime
Four walls won't hold me tonight
If this town
Is just an apple
Then let me take a bite
If they say --
Why, why, tell 'em that it's human nature
Why, why, does he do me that way
If they say --
Why, why, tell 'em that it's human nature
Why, why does he do me that way
Reaching out
To touch a stranger
Electric eyes are ev'rywhere
See that girl
She knows I'm watching
She likes the way I stare
If they say --
Why, why, tell 'em that it's human nature
Why, why, does he do me that way
If they say --
Why, why, tell 'em that it's human nature
Why, why does he do me that way
I like lovin' this way
I like lovin' this way
Looking out
Across the morning
Where the city's heart begins to beat
Reaching out
I touch her shoulder
I'm dreaming of the street
If they say --
Why, why, tell 'em that it's human nature
Why, why, does he do me that way
If they say --
Why, why, tell 'em that it's human nature
Why, why does he do me that way
