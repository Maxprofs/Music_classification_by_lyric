                        It feels like the end when you're closer
 To losing your dreams than losing a friend
 Flying blind, I'm shooting into the dark
 Who will I find, oh, girl And if it takes me a lifetime
 I swear, I'll tear down every wall
 Love conquers all On my way, tomorrow, I rise with the sun
 Soon I'll be gone
 Baby, words can't say how the memories
 And feelings of love, they linger on, oh girl And if it takes me forever
 I know it's worth every teardrop that falls
 Love conquers all, baby Somewhere there's a place in your heart
 Where the wounds never heal
 (You're not alone)
 Well, you're not alone, that's just how I feel Love conquers all, this one will last a lifetime
 And if love conquers all, this one will last forever
 Oh
                        
                    |
