                        Three hundred years ago
 I thought I might get some sleep
 I stretched myself out onna antique bed
 An' my spirit did a midnite creep You know I'll never sleep no more It seem to me that it just ain't wise Didja ever wake up in the mornin'
 With a ZOMBY WOOF behind your eyes Just about as evil as you could be I am the ZOMBY WOOF
 I'm that creature all the ladies been
 Talkin' about I am the ZOMBY WOOF
 They all seek for shelter when I come chargin' out Tellin' you all the Zomby troof
 Here I'm is, the ZOMBY WOOF Tellin' you all the Zomby troof
 Here I'm is . . . Reety-awrighty, he da ZOMBY WOOF
 Reety-awrighty, he da ZOMBY WOOF They said aw-reety
 An' they was aw-righty
 An' I was a Zomby for you, little lady . . . I got a great big pointed fang
 Which is my Zomby Toof
 My right foot's bigger than my other one is
 Like a reg'lar Zomby Hoof
 If I raid your dormitorium
 Don't try to remain aloof . . . I might snatch you up screamin' through the window all nekkid
 An' do it to you on the roof, don't mess with the
 ZOMBY WOOF I am about as evil as a Boogie Man can be! Tellin' you all the Zomby Troof
 Here I'm is, the ZOMBY WOOF Tellin' you all the Zomby Troof
 Here I'm is, the ZOMBY WOOF
