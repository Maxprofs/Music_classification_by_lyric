                        Song: If I Believe You - The 1975

I've got a God-shaped hole, that's infected
And I'm petrified of being alone
It's pathetic, I know

And I toss and I turn in my bed
It's just like I lost my head (lost my head)

And if I believe you, would that make it stop?
If I told you I need you, is that what you want?
I'm broken and bleeding, and begging for help
And I'm asking you Jesus, show yourself

I thought I'd met you once or twice but that was just because the dabs
Were nice and opening up my mind
showing me consciousness is primary
In the universe and I had a revelation

I'll be your child if you insist
I mean, if it was you that made my body you probably shouldn't have made
Me atheist
I'm a lesbian kiss
I'm an evangelist
And "If you don't wanna go to hell then, Miss,
you better start selling this"

And if I believe you, would that make it stop?
If I told you I need you, is that what you want?
I'm broken and bleeding, and begging for help
And I'm asking you Jesus, show yourself

If I'm lost, then how can I find myself?
If I'm lost then how can I find myself?
If I'm lost then how can I find myself?
If I'm lost now then how can I find myself?
If I'm lost now then how can I find myself?
If I'm lost then how can I find myself?
Then how can I find myself?
If I'm lost now then how can I find myself?
Yeah, yeah, yeah
If I'm lost now then how can I find myself?
Yeah, yeah
