                        A friend of mine was talking I was earjacking, eavesdropping 
Down on my knees so I could hear what she was sayin' 
As I got closer to her fire her desire 
Was to lead me on and on and on and it was like
Beautiful We are free again 
We're out of here 
Beautiful
 You and me my friend 
Let's disappear
Now I got to thinkin' 
About my high speed dirty days 
What I want, what you need I think you best believe it 
Got it, want you here 
But you still gotta know 
We can skin it, we conceal it 
Yeah so baby let's begin it sayin'
Beautiful
 We are free again We're out of here 
Beautiful 
You and me my friend 
Let's disappear 
Beautiful
 Do all things We never tried 
Beautiful 
Just spread your wings And let if fly
Woah woah beautiful (x3) Beautiful yeah Beautiful

Beautiful We are free again We're out of here Beautiful You and me my friend Let's disappear Beautiful Do all things We never tried Beautiful Just spread your wings And let if fly
Woah woah beautiful (x2)
