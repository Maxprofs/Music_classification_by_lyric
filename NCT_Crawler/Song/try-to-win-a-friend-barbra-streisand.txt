                        When it's over, really over,
 There ain't nothin' can start it over again.
 Pack your bags and leave, ain't no use to grieve.
 Though you've lost a lover, try to win a friend. The partings easier when there are smiles instead of tears.
 In your dreams you see that moment even if you live a million years.
 Shake hands goodbye then, for remember when;
 Though you've lost a lover, try to win a friend. Let him go home, and cry your eyes out,
 You'll only feel a little better.
 Try to keep your body busy and let your mind forget him. 'Cause when it's over, really over,
 There ain't nothin' can start it over again.
 Shake hands goodbye then, for remember when;
 Though you've lost a lover, try to win a friend. Though you leave behind a lover,
 Leave behind a friend. Try to win a friend.
