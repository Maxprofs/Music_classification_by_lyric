                        Bài hát: Special Affair - The Internet

Penny for your thoughts
I know what you want
I can read your mind even from behind
(and)*** whats in your phone, let me take you home
I wanna take you home
Cause its so rare that im here, Dont plan on staying to long
So you should come here, sit yo ass on this throne
Its a Special Affair, Better act like you know who I am

Who I am

I bet this patrone make you feel nice and comfortable
Tryna Act nice, Girl your covers blown
But you already knew that, you already knew that, you already knew that (We can burn one)
We can burn one

Laying in the dark I might break your heart
I can't get you high if you wanna clown
*** whats in your phone, Let me take you home
I wanna take you home

Cause its so rare that im here, Dont plan on staying to long
So you should come here, sit yo ass on this throne
Its a Special Affair, Better act like you know who I am

who I am

I bet this patrone make you feel nice and comfortable
Tryna Act nice, Girl your covers blown
But you already knew that, you already knew that, you already knew that
I bet this patrone make you feel nice and comfortable
Tryna Act nice, Girl your covers blown
But you already knew that, you already knew that, you already knew that (We can burn one)

We can burn one

I bet this patrone

I bet this patrone
