                        Bài hát: Tragic Endings - Eminem, Skylar Grey

[Intro: Skylar Grey]
I'm stumbling, I can’t see straight
And it's my fault I got this way
I got my hands on something great
And found a way to mess it all up
I did my best, I tried to change
But it's just in my DNA
I got my hands on something great
And found a way to *** it up again
Now I’m the one thing
You couldn't hate more
But you're the one thing
That I would die for

[Verse 1: Eminem]
All my life, I was told, I was never nothing special
I don't need to be reminded of it every other second
'Specially when all my self-esteem's already shot to hell
I'm falling helplessly, I'm embarrased, I don’t want no one else to see
’Cause I feel like I'm a piece of ***, every time she yells at me
Selfishly addicted, but definitely doesn’t help that she
Makes me feel like I've died and gone to heaven, but makes life a living hell for me
She does that thing with her lip, now she's melting me
I'm putty in her palms, I’m wrapped around her finger
A yo-yo on a string, she lets me sit there and just dangle
Until something better comes along, and she'll just drop me like a hot potato
I look like I'm in pain, but I'm okay, though
'Cause I know she loves me, my friends, what do they know?

[Chorus: Skylar Grey]
It's like I'm drowning at sea
Hoping that you reach for me
I know you're there but I can't see
'Cause I'm so drunk off tragic endings
I'm dying to breathe
And all you do is strangle me
Such a beautiful relief
'Cause I'm so drunk off tragic endings
Drunk off tragic endings

[Verse 2: Eminem]
In my moments of weakness, I openly admit this ***, I wouldn't normally
I'm extremely self-conscious and enormously
Insecure and she uses it to torture when she torments me
It only turns to ammunition for her in this war when she
Gets going, she don't stop, when I'm up, she's like a downer
When I found her it was love at first encounter
Plus, somehow, she must've took the carton of eggs off the counter
Cracked them and placed all the shells on the ground for me to walk on when I'm around her
But there's just something 'bout her
That makes me not able to function without her
How can I get out of it when I don't know how to?
I'm a doubter, I'm a pessimist
Make a believer out of me
And show me the way now
Or stay the *** out of my cloud of rain
'Cause I'm going straight down the drain
I'm drowning

[Chorus: Skylar Grey]
It's like I'm drowning at sea
Hoping that you reach for me
I know you're there but I can't see
'Cause I'm so drunk off tragic endings
I'm dying to breathe
And all you do is strangle me
Such a beautiful relief
'Cause I'm so drunk off tragic endings
Drunk off tragic endings

[Bridge: Skylar Grey]
Now I'm the one thing
You couldn't hate more
But you're the one thing
That I would die for

[Verse 3: Eminem]
It took a while for me to get it, but I think I've figured it out
She don't want me, she just don't wanna see me with someone else
The idea of seeing me happy destroys her in itself
To see me falling to pieces brings her joy, brings her hell
But it annoys her to see me get this straight, then say "screw her"
I threw up on myself, I'm dumb sick, I'm addicted to her
She's tryna block the door, so here's how I do her
Since I'm manure, she's a sewer
This time, this piece of ***'s running through her
I can see that right now, I'm running to it
What the ***? Shoulda knew it
Who would think she'd actually have the balls to do it?
As soon as I hopped in it, she gassed the car with lighter fluid
She's standing there with a rag, 'bout to put the lighter to it
Lit the ***ing thing on fire, then she threw it

[Chorus: Skylar Grey]
It's like I'm drowning at sea
Hoping that you reach for me
I know you're there but I can't see
'Cause I'm so drunk off tragic endings
I'm dying to breathe
And all you do is strangle me
Such a beautiful relief
'Cause I'm so drunk off tragic endings
Drunk off tragic endings
