Trình Bày: Scorpions
Let me take you far away
You d like a holiday
Exchange the cold days for the sun
Good time and fun
Let me takes and fun
You d like a holiday
Let me take you far away
You d like a holiday
Exchange your troubles for some love
Wherever you are
Let me take you far away
You d like a holiday
Longing for the sun you will come
To the island without name
Longing for the sun be welcom
On the island many miles away from home
Be welcome on the island without name
Longing for the sun you will come
To the island many miles away form home
                        
                    |
