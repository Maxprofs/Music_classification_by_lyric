                        Bài hát: Body - Léon

Saw you leaving in the morning light
Nothing you could say to make me feel better
In the sunrise on your motorbike
Summer loving never lasts forever

Tell me something, was it ever love?
You said this city never felt like home
If I see you, will it feel the same?
Or will you miss me? Or was it a game?

I keep thinking 'bout your body
I keep dreaming 'bout your body
Cause there's nobody else quite like you
Are you thinking 'bout my body, body too?

Uh-huh
Uh-huh

We would sink into a purple sky
Lost in love and lost in endless nights
Say let's stay and be forever young, young
Keep on dreaming that we'd run, run

Tell me something, was it ever love?
You said this city never felt like home
If I see you, will it feel the same?
Or will you miss me? Or was it a game?

I keep thinking 'bout your body
I keep dreaming 'bout your body
Cause there's nobody else quite like you
Are you thinking 'bout my body, body too?

Say you remember
Say you remember
Cause I remember
Oh, I remember

Tell me something, was it ever love?
You said this city never felt like home
If I see you, will it feel the same?
Or will you miss me? Or was it a game?

I keep thinking 'bout your body
I keep dreaming 'bout your body
Cause there's nobody else quite like you
Are you thinking 'bout my body, body too?

I keep thinking
I can't stop thinking
I keep thinking
I can't stop thinking
I keep thinking
I can't stop thinking
                        
                    |
