                        Bài hát: This Is What You Came For/Into You - Ariana Grande, Rihanna, Calvin Harris

[Verse 1] 
I'm so into you, I can barely breathe 
And all I wanna do is to fall in deep 
But close ain't close enough 'til we cross the line 
So name a game to play, and I'll roll the dice 

[Pre-Chorus] 
Oh baby, look what you started 
The temperature is rising 
And here is this gonna happen 
Been waiting and waiting for you to make a move 
Before I make a move 

[Chorus] 
So baby, come light me up 
And maybe I'll let you on it 
A little bit dangerous 
But baby, that's how I want it 
A little less conversation, and a little more touch my body 
Cause I'm so into you, into you, into you 
Got everyone watchin' us 
So baby, let's keep it secret 
A little bit scandalous 
But baby, don't let them see it 
A little less conversation and a little more touch my body 
Cause I'm so into you, into you, into you 

[Verse 2] 
We go fast 'til they can't replay 
Who knows why it's gotta be this way 
We say nothing more than we need 
I say "your place" when we leave 

[Pre-Chorus] 
Oh baby, look what you started 
The temperature is rising 
And here is this gonna happen 
Been waiting and waiting for you to make a move 
Before I make a move

[Chorus] 
But she's looking at you, oh, oh 
You, oh, oh, you, oh, oh 
You, oh, oh, you, oh, oh 
You, oh, oh, oh, oh
Cause I'm so into you, into you, into you
You, oh, oh, you, oh, oh 
You, oh, oh, you, oh, oh 
You, oh, oh, oh, oh
Cause I'm so into you, into you, into you

[Bridge] 
Tell me what you came here for
This is what you came for
'Cause I can't, I can't wait no more 
I'm on the edge of no control 
This is what you came for
And I need, I need you to know, you to know 

[Chorus] 
So baby, come light me up 
And maybe I'll let you on it 
A little bit dangerous 
But baby, that's how I want it 
A little less conversation, and a little more touch my body
And everybody's watching her
But she's looking at you, oh, oh 
You, oh, oh, you, oh, oh 
You, oh, oh, you, oh, oh 
You, oh, oh, oh, oh 
Cause I'm so into you, into you, into you
You, oh, oh, you, oh, oh (So come light me up, so come light me up my baby)
You, oh, oh, you, oh, oh (D-Dangerous, a little bit dangerous my boy)
You, oh, oh, oh, oh (A little less conversation and a little more touch my body)
Cause I'm so into you.....
