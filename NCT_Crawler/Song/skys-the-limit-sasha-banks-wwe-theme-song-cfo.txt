Had dream l
I hadn't made it
There's nothing dragging
Down me now
Cause a girl gonna
push it all out the way

Destined to break in
I found my way
Yeah

Now ain't nobody gonna take it

Cause a girl gonna
push 'em all out the way

I had a dream that
I made it here in the spotlight

Woke up, see my life in the shade
Now that's not quite
Hustlin' every day

I'm on my way to that sharp light
Its my destiny
To be bigger

Yeah I got fight
And I've had visions
Of sitting high on my own gold throne
Never listening to criticism

I built my own
From the bottom
Ive gotton myself in my own zone
Never stop and I made it

And now I ain't going home
Had dream l
I hadn't made it
There's nothing dragging
Down me now
Cause a girl gonna
push it all out the way
Destined to break in
I found my way
Yeah
Now ain't nobody gonna take it
Cause a girl gonna
push 'em all out the way
I remember when
Couldn't pay the rent
Now I own the whole
Building that I'm living in
Sky's the limit
When you're never giving in
You get In
You ride it out and
Don't look back again
And I've had visions
Of sitting high on my own gold throne
Never listening to criticism
I built my own
From the bottom
Ive gotton myself in my own zone
Never stop and I made it
And now I ain't going home
Had dream l
I hadn't made it
There's nothing dragging
Down me now
Cause a girl gonna
push it all out the way
Destined to break in
I found my way
Yeah
Now ain't nobody gonna take it
Cause a girl gonna
push 'em all out the way
Okay
Aha
