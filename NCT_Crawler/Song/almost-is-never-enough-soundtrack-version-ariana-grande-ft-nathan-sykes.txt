                        Almost Is Never Enough - Ariana Grande, Nathan Sykes

I like to say we gave it a try
I like to blame it all on life
Maybe we just weren't right
But that's a lie, that's a lie
And we can deny it as much as we want
But at time our feelings will show
'Cause sooner or later
We'll wonder why we gave up
The truth is everyone knows
Almost, almost is never enough 
So close to being in love
If I would have know that you wanted me
The way I wanted you
Then maybe we wouldn't be two worlds apart
But right here at eachother's arms
We almost, we almost knew what love was
But almost is never enough

If I could change the world over night
There'd be no such thing as goodbye
You'll be standing right where you were
And we'd get the chance we deserve
Try to deny it as much as you want
But inside it my feelings will show
Cause sooner or later
We'll wonder why we gave up
The truth is everyone knows
Almost, almost is never enough 
So close to being in love
If I would have know that you wanted me 
The way I wanted you
Then maybe we wouldn't be two worlds apart
But right here at eachother's arms
We almost, we almost knew what love was
But almost is never enough
