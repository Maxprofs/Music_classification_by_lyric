                        Song: Get Up - Ciara, Chamillionaire

Ladies and gentlemen, Ciara!

He said, “Hi, my name is so and so, baby, can you tell me yours?
You look like you came to do one thing, set it off”
I started on the left and I had to take him to the right
He was out of breath but he kept on dancin' all night

You try an' admit it but you just can fight the feelin' inside
You know it and I can see it in your eyes
You want me, you smooth as a mother
You're so undercover by the way that you was watchin' me

Ooh! Uh, the way you look at me I'm feelin' you, uh
I just can't help it tryin' to keep it cool, uh
I can feel it in the beat, uh, when you do those things to me, uh
Don't let nothin' stop you

Move, ring the alarm, the club is jumpin' now
So get up!

I said “Ciara's on your radio” everybody turn it up
Spicy just like hot sauce careful you might burn it up
You can do the pop lock, ragtime, don't stop
That's the way you gotta get, get it, make ya body rock

You try an' admit it but you just can beat the feelin' inside
You know it ‘cause I can see it in your eyes
You want me, you smooth as a mother
You're so undercover by the way that you was watchin' me

Ooh! Uh, the way you look at me I'm feelin' you, uh
I just can't help it tryin' to keep it cool, uh
I can feel it in the beat, uh, when you do those things to me, uh
Don't let nothin' stop you

Move, ring the alarm, the club is jumpin' now
So get up!

Ooh, I love the way you vibin' me
Dance with me forever
We can have a good time, follow me
To the beat together

You and me, one on one
Breakin' it down
You can't walk away now
We got to turn this place out, ooh

It's the kid that stay ridin' big
The one the police tried to catch ridin' dirty
In the club before eleven o'clock
Like I'm tryin' to catch it down kinda early

Lookin' thick, her hair brown and curly
She love the way my ride shinin' pearly
City boys say she fine and pretty
In the country boys say she fine and purrty

Yeah, my pocket's thick as green, it's curvy
And the ladies know soon as they see my jewelry
If bein' fresh to death is a crime
I think it's time for me to see the jury

You know Chamillionaire stay on the grind
A hustla like me is hard to find
I ain't really impressed, yes
Unless it's about some dollar signs

Ain't really no need to call you fine
I know you be hearin' that all the time
I'm watchin' you do ya step, do ya step
Yep, it's goin down

Ooh! Uh, the way you look at me I'm feelin' you, uh
I just can't help it tryin' to keep it cool, uh
I can feel it in the beat, uh, when you do those things to me, uh
Don't let nothin' stop you

Move, ring the alarm, the club is jumpin' now
So get up!

Ooh! Uh, the way you look at me I'm feelin' you, uh
I just can't help it tryin' to keep it cool, uh
I can feel it in the beat, uh, when you do those things to me, uh
Don't let nothin' stop you

Move, ring the alarm, the club is jumpin' now
So get up!

I got to have you baby
Uh, I feel it, I got to have you baby
I got to have you baby
Uh, I feel it, I got to have you baby
