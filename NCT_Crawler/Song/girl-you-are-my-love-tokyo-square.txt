                        Bài hát: Girl You Are My Love - Tokyo Square

Girl you are my love
You're my heart and soul
You're my shining star
My love is just for you

l'll be feeling blue lady without you
Every breath that l take and every step one want to make
I want to share my love with you right till the end of time

I want to hold you by my side
I want to make you stay tonight
Girl somehow l know deep inside your heart that you need my tender touch
Girl somehow l know deep inside your heart that you need my tender touch
