                        No baby, no baby, no baby
 No, no, no If you take your love away from me
 Ill go crazy, Ill go insane No baby, no baby, no baby
 No, no, no
 No baby, no baby, no baby
 No, no, no Youve got your problems baby and Ive got mine
 Lets just spend it all by putting it together, yeah
 When you say you love me it dont mean a thing
 If you care, youll be there, like you used to be, yeah Im searching for the words to make you realize
 That I really, really want you to stay, oh
 Tears of frustration I hold inside
 But if you walk away youll make this grown man cry Dont leave, dont leave me girl
 Please stay with me tonight
 Dont leave me girl
 Please stay with me tonight Forget my pride girl, I beg you youre my heart, youre my soul
 Youve got so much control
 My love runs deep within the ocean and sea
 But if you sail away youll take a center piece of me Dont leave, dont leave me girl
 Please stay with me tonight
 Dont leave me girl
 Please stay with me tonight No, dont go
 Dont leave, dont leave me girl
 Please stay with me tonight
 Dont leave me girl
 Please stay with me tonight Stay, stay, stay
 Stay right here with me forever
 Stay, stay, stay
 Stay right here with me forever If you take your love away from me
 Ill go crazy, crazy, crazy, insane
 If you take your love away from me
 Ill go crazy, Ill go insane
 If you take your love away from me
 Ill go crazy, Ill go insane Stay, stay, stay
 Stay right here with me forever
 Stay, stay, stay
 Stay right here with me forever No, no, no
 No baby, no baby, no baby
