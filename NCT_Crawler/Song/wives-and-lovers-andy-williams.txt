                        Song: Wives And Lovers - Andy Williams

Hey little girl, comb your hair, fix your makeup
Soon he will open the door
Don't think because there's a ring on your finger
You needn't try anymore

For wives should always be lovers too
Run to his arms the moment he comes home to you
I'm warning you

Day after day, there are girls at the office
And men will always be men
Don't send him off with your hair still in curlers
You may not see him again

For wives should always be lovers too
Run to his arms the moment he comes home to you
He's almost here

Hey little girl, better wear something pretty
Something you'd wear to go to the city
And dim all the lights, pour the wine
Start the music, time to get ready for love
Time to get ready for love, time to get ready
