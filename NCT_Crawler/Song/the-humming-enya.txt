                        Bài hát: The Humming... - Enya

And all the light will be revealed
And all the future prophecy
And all the waves deceive the sea
And on the road are you and me

Mmmhmmm, mmmhmmm
Mmmhmmm, mmmhmmm
Mmmhmmm, mmmhmmm
Mmmhmmm, mmmhmmm

And all the winds are like a kiss
And all the years are nemesis
And all the moments fall in mist
And all is dust, remember this

Mmmhmmm, mmmhmmm
Mmmhmmm, mmmhmmm
Mmmhmmm, mmmhmmm
Mmmhmmm, mmmhmmm

And all the light will be, will be
And all the waves deceive
And all the waves deceive the sea
When all the light will be

And all the dust will drift away
And all the nights and all the days
And all the heavens go their way
And only change is here to stay

Mmmhmmm, mmmhmmm
Mmmhmmm, mmmhmmm
Mmmhmmm, mmmhmmm
Mmmhmmm, mmmhmmm

And all the light will be, will be
And all the waves deceive
And all the waves deceive the sea
When all the light will be

And all the stars without a name
And all the skies that look the same
And all the clouds that fade and then
Then all of this begins again

Mmmhmmm, mmmhmmm
                        
                    |
