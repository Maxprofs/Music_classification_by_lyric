                        Bài hát: Lollipop - The Treblemakers

[Intro]
Hey yo, Trebles!
Sucking too hard on your lollipop
Oh, love's gonna get you down

[Chorus]
Sucking too hard on your lollipop
Oh, love's gonna get you down
Sucking too hard on your lollipop
Loves gonna get you down
[Verse 1]
I went walking with my momma one day
When she warned me what people say
Live your life until love is found
Cause loves gonna get you down
Take a look at the girl next door
She's a player and a downright bore
Jesus loves her but she wants more
Oh, bad girls get you down
Sing it!

[Chorus]
Sucking too hard on your lollipop
Oh, love's gonna get you down
Sucking too hard on your lollipop
Loves gonna get you down

[Bridge]
Say love, say love
Oh, love's gonna get you down
Say love, say love
Oh, love's gonna get you down

[Verse 2]
Mama told me what I should know
Too much candy gonna rot your soul
If she loves you let her go
Cause love only gets you down
Take a look at a boy like me
Never stood on my own two feet
Now I'm blue as I can be
Oh, love only got me down

Sing it!
Sucking too hard on your lollipop
Oh, loves gonna get you down
Sucking too hard on your lollipop
Oh, loves gonna get you down

[Bridge]
Say love, say love
Oh, love's gonna get you down
Say love, say love
Oh, love's gonna get you down


[Interlude]
Someone, drop some bass
Love, love, say love love
Now we need some baritone
Love, love, say love love
Someone give me some tenor
Love, love, say love love
Now give me some love love love love
Love, love, love
Gonna get you down down down
Loving, loving, loving
Sucking, sucking, sucking

[Outro]
Oh love's gonna get you down
                        
                    |
