                        Santana,Rachel,Mercedes,Finn,Artie,Tina,Kurt - Don't Stop Believin' (Regionals Version)
Album: Journey to Regionals (2010)

Just a small town girl
Livin' in a lonely world
She took the midnight train going anywhere

Just a city boy
Born and raised in South Detroit
He took the midnight train going anywhere

A singer in a smokey room
The smell of wine and cheap perfume
For a smile they can share the night
It goes on and on and on and on

Strangers waiting
Up and down the boulevard
Their shadows searching in the night
Streetlight people
Living just to find emotion
Hiding, somewhere in the night

Working hard to get my fill
Everybody wants a thrill
Payin' anything to roll the dice
Just one more time

Some will win, some will lose
Some were born to sing the blues
Oh, the movie never ends
It goes on and on and on and on

Strangers waiting
Up and down the boulevard
Their shadows searching in the night

Streetlight people
Living just to find emotion
Hiding, somewhere in the night

Don't Stop

Don't stop believin'
Hold on to the feelin'
Streetlight people
woahhhh

Don't stop believin'
Hold on to that feeling
Streetlight people
Ohhh, woahhhh
Don't stop
Hold on to that feelin'
Streetlight people
                        
                    |
