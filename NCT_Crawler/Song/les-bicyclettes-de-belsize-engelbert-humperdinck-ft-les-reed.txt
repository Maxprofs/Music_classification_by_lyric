                        Turning and turning the world goes on
 We can't change it, my friend
 Let us go riding now through the days
 Together to the end, till the end Les bicyclettes de Belsize
 Carry us side by side
 And hand in hand we will ride
 Over Belsize Turn your magical eyes round and around
 Looking at all we found
 Carry us through the skies
 Les bicyclettes de Belsize Spinning and spinning the dreams I know
 Rolling on through my head
 Let us enjoy them before they go
 Come the dawn, they all are dead
 Yes, they're dead Les bicyclettes de Belsize
 Carry us side by, by side
 And hand in hand we will ride
 Over Belsize Turn your magical eyes round and around
 Lookin' at all we found
 Carry us through the skies
 Les bicyclettes de Belsize
