                        Bài hát: Layers (MODv) - Hiroyuki Sawano, Aimee Blackschleger

[Intro]
I will lay down my sword
My rebellion is yours

[Verse 1]
And I know I'm not the first to have come here
Someone told me you can help me with so many layers
I'm a danger
I'm a stranger
Full of anger
But I need to know
To be with him
To be happy
Oh creator

Want to find the reason why we have to cry
The buildings falling down and no one's there to save us
Gonna find the answer, how to clear this up
You made these crazy worlds
I'm stuck between the two

Want to find a reason why my friends all died
The magic and machines
They stopped and the virus set in
Find a good solution, how to fix this up
You made these crazy worlds
I'm stuck between the two

[Verse 2]
In a village past the mountains of your world
Someone told her death was coming soon
To all of us
In the tavern"Armageddon"
"The horizon"
People were talking of a hunger
Many years back
I was younger

Want to find the reason why we have to cry
The buildings falling down and no one's there to save us
Gonna find the answer, how to clear this up
You made these crazy worlds
I'm stuck between the two

Want to find a reason why my friends all died
The magic and machines
They stopped and the virus set in
Find a good solution, how to fix this up
You made these crazy worlds
I'm stuck between the two

Want to find the reason why we have to cry
The buildings falling down and no one's there to save us
Gonna find the answer, how to clear this up
You made these crazy worlds
I'm stuck between the two

Want to find a reason why my friends all died
The magic and machines
They stopped and the virus set in
Find a good solution, how to fix this up
You made these crazy worlds
I'm stuck between the two
