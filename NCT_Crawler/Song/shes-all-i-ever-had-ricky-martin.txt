                        Here I am, broken wings
Quiet thoughts, unspoken dreams
Here I am, alone again
I need her now to hold my hand

She's all, she's all I ever had
She's the air I breathe, yeah
She's all, she's all I ever had

It's the way she makes me feel
It's the only thing that's real
It's the way she understands
She's my lover, she's my friend
When I look into her eyes
It's the way I feel inside
Like the man I wanna be
She's all I'll ever need

So much time, so much pain but
There's one thing that still remains, it's the
The way she cared the love we shared
And through it all, she's always been there

She's all, she's all I ever had
In a world so cold, so empty
She's all, she's all I ever had

It's the way she makes me feel
It's the only thing that's real
It's the way she understands
She's my lover, she's my friend
And when I look into her eyes
It's the way I feel inside
Like the man I wanna be
She's all I'll ever need

She's all, she's all I ever had
I love to make her see
She's all, she's all I ever had

It's the way she makes me feel
It's the only thing that's real
It's the way she understands
She's my lover, she's my friend
When I look into her eyes
It's the way I feel inside
Like the man I wanna be
She's all I'll ever need

It's the way she makes me feel
It's the only thing that's real
It's the way she understands
She's my lover, she's my friend
When I look into her eyes
It's the way I feel inside
Like the man I wanna be
She's all I'll ever need
