                        Bài hát: Lost Boys (Ocean Park Standoff Vs Seeb) - Ocean Park Standoff, Seeb

Let's take the night off from caring bout tomorrow
Let's take our minds off the things we can't control
Let's take our clothes off and jump into the ocean
Don't know where we're goin' but it's somewhere out there

We've got our whole lives left
To make some memories
Drunk nights that we forget
I will remember best
We stole a tricycle
And then it all goes black
Handcuffs behind my back
Yeah I remember that

(Whoooaaa)
We're not gonna grow up
(Whoooaaa)
'Least not till the sun's up

Let's take the night off from caring bout tomorrow
Let's take our minds off the things we can't control
Let's take our clothes off and jump into the ocean
Don't know where we're goin' but it's somewhere out there
Let's take the night off from caring bout tomorrow
Let's take our minds off the things we can't control
Let's take our clothes off and jump into the ocean
Don't know where we're goin' but it's somewhere out there

It's late but no light yet
Still time for Juliet
To hear my Romeo
Yelled through the window

(Whoooaaa)
We're not gonna grow up
(Whoooaaa)
'Least not 'till the sun's up

Let's take the night off from caring bout tomorrow
Let's take our minds off the things we can't control
Let's take our clothes off and jump into the ocean
Don't know where we're goin' but it's somewhere out there
Let's take the night off from caring bout tomorrow
Let's take our minds off the things we can't control
Let's take our clothes off and jump into the ocean
Don't know where we're goin' but it's somewhere out there

So late it's early now
Watchin' the moon go down
Holdin' your breath
Let it out
Let it out (Oh!)

Let's take the night off from caring bout tomorrow (Let's take the night off)
Let's take our minds off the things we can't control
Let's take our clothes off and jump into the ocean
Don't know where we're goin' but it's somewhere out there
Let's take the night off from caring bout tomorrow
Let's take our minds off the things we can't control
Let's take our clothes off and jump into the ocean
Don't know where we're goin' but it's somewhere out there
We got our whole lives left (whole lives left)
To make some memories, yea
Those nights that we forget
I will remember best
We're not gonna grow up
'Least not 'til the sun's up
Whoa
