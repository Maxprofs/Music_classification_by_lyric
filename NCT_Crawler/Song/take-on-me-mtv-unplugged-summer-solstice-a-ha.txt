                        Bài hát: Take On Me (Mtv Unplugged - Summer Solstice) - a-ha

Talking away
I don't know what
I'm to say I'll say it anyway
Today's another day to find you
Shying away
I'll be coming for your love, OK
Take on me (Take on me)

Take me on (Take on me)
I'll be gone
In a day or two
So needless to say
Odds and ends
But I'll be stumbling away
Slowly learning that life is OK

Say after me
Almost better to be safe than sorry
Take on me (Take on me)
Take me on (Take on me)
I'll be gone
In a day or two

Oh, things that you say
Is it live or
Just to play my worries away
You're all the things I've got to remember
You're shying away
I'll be coming for you anyway

Take on me (Take on me)
Take me on (Take on me)
I'll be gone
In a day or two
Take on me
                        
                    |
