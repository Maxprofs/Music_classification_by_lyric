                        Bài hát: Never Be The Same - Jessica Mauboy

Let me tell you about a girl that I used to be,
Same name same face but a different me,
She didn't know what she was thinking,
Didn't know her world was sinking,
Had her dreams written on a paper in her hand,
Held on tight but she didn't understand,
The love and hurt that she's replacing,
All the past that she's erasing,
We all get lost sometimes and we forget who we are and we forget who we are

Somewhere along the way, we're all running in the crazy race,
Never thinking about the hearts we break,
And as our hope starts fading away things are never gonna be the same,
Cause when you're standing there all alone,
Losing everything you've ever known,
You're staring at a different face things are never gonna be the same,

I wish that I could share a different point of view,
But the words coming out wouldn't speak the truth,
You wouldn't know what I was really thinking,
And I'd return to the girl, who's sinking,
Sinking down to the world that waits below,
And I don't want to be there anymore,
Don't wanna be there anymore,
We all get lost sometimes and we forget who we are and we forget who we are

Somewhere along the way, we're all running in the crazy race,
Never thinking about the hearts we break,
And as our hope starts fading away things are never gonna be the same,
Cause when you're standing there all alone,
Losing everything you've ever known,
You're staring at a different face things are never gonna be the same,

The more you win, the more you want,
It never ends, it never stops,
Oh it's never enough,
Oh, the more you win, the more you want,
It never ends, it never stops,
Oh it's never enough,

We're all running in the crazy race,
Never thinking about the hearts we break,
And as our hope starts fading away things are never gonna be the same,
Cause when you're standing there all alone,
Losing everything you've ever known,
You're staring at a different face things are never gonna be the same,
Things are never gonna be the same,
Things are never gonna be the same,
When you're standing there all alone,
Losing everything you've ever known,
You're staring at a different face things are never gonna be the same,
Things are never gonna be the same,
Things are never gonna be the same,
Never gonna be the same.
