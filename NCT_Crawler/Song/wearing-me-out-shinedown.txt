                        Bài hát: Wearing Me Out - Shinedown

[Verse 1]
My name is worthless like you told me I once was
My name is empty cause you drained away the love
My name is searching since you stole my only soul
My name is hatred and the reasons we both know

Worthless, empty, searching, hatred
Well who am I right now?

[Chorus]
You’re fuckin’ wearing me out!
You’re always dragging me down!
You’re the fake, fallen, force of nature, sick mind
I don’t need a gun to take back what’s mine
It’s over
It’s over now
You’re done wearing me out

[Verse 2]
My name is screaming like the sound of your heart failing
My name is loco like the motive that betrayed me

Screaming, loco, don’t say you know
Who I am right now

[Chorus]
You’re fuckin’ wearing me out!
You’re always dragging me down!
You’re the fake, fallen, force of nature, sick mind
I don’t need a gun to take back what’s mine
It’s over
It’s over now
You’re done wearing me out

You’re wearing me out [x6]

[Bridge]
You’ll be ancient history
But who am I right now?

My name is revenge and I’m here to save my name

[Chorus]
You’re fuckin’ wearing me out!
You’re always dragging me down!
You’re the fake, fallen, force of nature, sick mind
I don’t need a gun to take back what’s mine
(You’re fuckin’ wearing me out)
It’s over
(You’re always dragging me down)
It’s over

You’re the fake, fallen, force of nature, sick mind
I don’t need a gun to take back what’s mine
It’s over
It’s over now
You’re done wearing me out
                        
                    |
