                        Sometimes when I’m sitting on my bed feeling so, so lonely

Wishing someone’d hold me

All I had three little notes playing in my head

Outside I can cover all the scars

Inside lie the words just pleading to be heard cause

All I have is three million melodies to just kill the hurt



And now I’m ready I’m going to sing them all out

Sing them out just for myself

I don’t even care what the world thinks bout how I sound



Cause when I open my mouth

My whole heart comes out

Every tear I want to cry is satisfied

I’m singing till I’m winning

I going to sing all night



Cause when I open my mouth

There is no place to hide

Everything that I’ve been feeling runs wild and free

Singing cause I’m winning

I’m going to sing for me



I stand in believing who I am

Take shots at my heart, but who am I to give a

Everybody needs a melody to set their souls free

My stage is the greatest in the world

Give back to the ones who struggled with me, stayed true

Reminding me to see my chosen destiny



And now I’m ready I’m going to sing it all out

Sing it out just for myself

I don’t even care what the world thinks bout how I sound





Cause when I open my mouth

My whole heart comes out

Every tear I want to cry is satisfied

I’m singing till I’m winning

I going to sing all night



Cause when I open my mouth

There is no place to hide

Everything that I’ve been feeling runs wild and free

Singing cause I’m winning

I’m going to sing for me



Sing for me,

Sing for myself, sing how I believe

Right here, right now, let the wave come down



Sing for me,

Sing for myself, sing how I believe

Let my heart, heart come out

Right here, right now, let me own my very own sound



Cause when I open my mouth

My whole heart comes out

Every tear I want to cry is satisfied

I’m singing till I’m winning

I going to sing all night



Cause when I open my mouth

There is no place to hide

Everything that I’ve been feeling runs wild and free

I’m singing cause I’m winning

I’m going to sing for me
