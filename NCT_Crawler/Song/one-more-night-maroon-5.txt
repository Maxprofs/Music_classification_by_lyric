                        Bài hát: One More Night 
Ca sĩ: Maroon 5

You and I go hard at each other 
Like we're going to war
You and I go rough
We keep throwing things and slamming the door
You and I get so damn dysfunctional
We start keeping score
You and I get sick yeah 
I know that we can't do this no more
Yeah but baby there you go again
There you go again making me love you
Yeah I stopped using my head
Using my head let it all go
Got you stuck on my body 
On my body like a tattoo
And now I'm feeling stupid
Feeling stupid crawling back to you
So I cross my heart and I hope to die
That I'll only stay with you one more night
And I know I said it a million times
But I'll only stay with you one more night
Try to tell you no 
But my body keeps on telling you yes
Try to tell you stop 
But your lipstick got me so out of breath
I'll be waking up in the morning
Probably hating myself.
And I'll be waking up
Feeling satisfied but guilty as hell
Yeah, but baby there you go again
There you go again making me love you
Yeah I stopped using my head
Using my head, let it all go
Got you stuck on my body 
On my body like a tattoo.
And now I'm feeling stupid
Feeling stupid crawling back to you
So I cross my heart and I hope to die
That I'll only stay with you one more night
And I know I said it a million times
But I'll only stay with you one more night
Yeah baby give me one more night
Yeah baby give me one more night
Yeah baby give me one more night
Yeah but baby there you go again 
There you go again making me love you
Yeah I stopped using my head 
Using my head let it all go
Got you stuck on my body
On my body like a tattoo
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
So I cross my heart and I hope to die
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
That I'll only stay with you one more night
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
And I know I said it a million times
Oh I said it a million times
But I'll only stay with you one more night
Yeah baby give me one more night
So I cross my heart and I hope to die
That I'll only stay with you one more night 
And I know I said it a million times
But I'll only stay with you one more night
I don't know whatever
