                        bài hát : Caravan Of Life - Henry Chúc

 What can you say and see it all just slip away
Washing up opportunities
A change when being but you wouldn't play
All you had to do was ask
I'll quckly give the time to tink
There's nothing that can matter change.


You get the second change to see this is good one way
You can change the day gone by
It doesn't matter how you try
Watch the hands of time not shown
And see the caravan of life go by.

2. And so you day soon
Perhaps you come to know the truth when my rage was aways run
And we have the late to keep this guy with you
Once again we are we must it'll quickly give the time to spend
Everyting is show to see how the year fly by
Thought you never realize though space
You never even tried.

What can you say when you see it all just slip away
Wasting up opportunities
A change when being but you wouldn't play
All you had to do was ask
It'll quickly give the time to spend
Everythings is shown to seehow the year fly by
                        
                    |
