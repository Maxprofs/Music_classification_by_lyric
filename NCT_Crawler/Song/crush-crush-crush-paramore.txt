                        I got a lot to say to you,
Yeah, I got a lot to say.
I noticed your eyes are always glued to me,
Keeping them here and it makes not sense at all.

They taped over your mouth,
Scribbled out the truth.
With their lies,
You little spies.
They taped over your mouth,
Scribbled out the truth.
With their lies,
Your little spies.

Crush. Crush. Crush. Crush, crush.

2, 3, 4!

Nothing compares to,
A quiet evening alone.
Just the one two,
I was just counting on.
That never happens,
I guess I’m dreaming again.
Let’s be more than,
This.

If you want to play it like a game,
Well, come on, come on, let’s play.
Cuz I’d rather waste my life pretending,
Then have to forget you for one whole minute.

They taped over your mouth,
Scribbled out the truth.
With their lies,
You little spies.

Nothing compares to,
A quiet evening alone.
Just the one two,
I was just counting on.
That never happens,
I guess I’m dreaming again.
Let’s be more than,
This now!

Rock and roll, baby.
Don’t you know that we’re all alone now,
I need something to sing about.
Rock and roll, Hey!
Don’t you know baby, we’re all alone now,
I need something to sing about.
Rock and roll, Hey!
Don’t you know, baby, we’re all alone now,
Give me something to sing about.

Nothing compares to,
A quiet evening alone.
Just the one two,
I was just counting on.
That never happens,
I guess I’m dreaming again.
Let’s be more than,
No, ohh.

Let’s be more than,
More than this.
