R&B/Hip Hop/Rap|

                        (Wale)
 Wale, I kick it, I kick it like Olindo
 I wear my Nike boots in Gucci
 I don't wear no Timbo
 I kick it any tempo
 I'm lifted off the indo
 I'm poppin champagne, drinkin till I'm jumpin out the windooow, haha If the autotune's gone bet they'll all tune in
 So I'mma do it bigger than an Audemar wrist watch
 Hip-Hop slackin, why they gettin Grammies when these niggas is actin?
 They phony, should get Tonies for the thing that they be yappin
 It's utterly bologna so I'm Muslim to these rappers
 *** yappin they lucky we don't clap em
 And have them people leakin like they're CD isn't mastered
 CD is in plasic, these niggas is has-beens
 We ain't makin friends while these niggas is Anistons
 Dig, these niggas is fake joe
 Hip-Hop need to wake up, we the fuckin clock radios (HOOK)
 We original officially the most original
 If we wasn't so original then we'd be criminal
 Wale and K'naan they don't know is they're radio
 How the hell did they fit the TV in the radiooo (Wale)
 They told me go in, no problem I'mma go in
 And shy away from drama, I ain't run away from no man
 And there ain't been no buster prepared for you suckas
 Then they'll play with Mario Brothers when it was duck hunt
 That's words to my mama, since I was in a starter
 A nigga been a star before I forfeited my scholar
 *** didn't finish college, *** wasn't a problem
 *** my homecoming is here I'm who they call up
 So I still be on that yard with a feely of that Marley
 From the city the Philly women willing to menage
 Though I put em on pause since Manilli been involved
 Though everybody's on me like the Milli V part
 Now I'm from the D Dot where we not no beatboxers
 We talkin B blockers keep us with deep pockets
 See not no fad or no internet phenom
 But he be's on that web like he be's with Pete Parker
 Me I'm not shy and my partner's Somalian
 K'naan and my buzz is too big like Comala
 Ballin, Folarin so *** hard
 Fat rhymes everytime bitch Roseanne bars... Wale (HOOK) (K'naan)
 I don't know why the industry wanna keep me a secret
 And Wale been tellin other rappers take a deep breath
 And don't perform after him or you might regret
 I guess they didn't get the memo or the leaflet
 You know if you was harder than me then you'd be led
 And if you had more street cred then you'd be dead
 And I'm Somali so I guess I'm just trynna eat bread
 ***in with my people well that's called the Heath Ledge
 Needless to say I turn rap beef to piglets
 Make you speechless, make you bloody, make you teethless
 Then the blood drip on the floor poison pieces
 I been on more red carpets than Ryan Seacrest
 Don't cross me cause my friend I'm no Jesus
 I don't turn cheecks or draw blood like leeches
 And my friend's a nut me spark in heaters
 Get your ass privileges with parking meters
 Do I condone it or is this some kinda small talk?
 Course not, I'm big like horse nut
 Under pressure I don't sweat like my pores shut
 I'm from the ten shacks where mishaps get fix fast by klick klacks and big bwaps
 And inside they think rap soft
 My pen sparks the benchmark I fench off tar
 No sixteen, no vaccine, I'm so sick my ten bars cough
 Now I'm off (Wale)
 Hold up, hold up, hold up
