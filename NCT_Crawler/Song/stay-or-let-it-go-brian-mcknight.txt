                        What's up girl? I need to talk to you for a minute
 I can't keep playin' myself like this
 There's only one thing I wanna know
 Should I stay or should I go? It's not my fault that you made yourself a regretful past
 But all I know is, it makes me look bad
 When I'm holdin' your hand and you see old friends you knew
 And they walk away laughin', callin' me a fool Now baby, I can't change the things you did before we met
 Even though I didn't know you
 But it's hard for me to trust you even though girl, I love you
 So tell me what am I to do? yeah Don't know if we would last
 And if we do last can I erase the past?
 Girl, can you tell me? I don't know
 Should I stay or let it go? Don't know if we're meant to be
 And if we should be, could you live faithfully?
 Girl, can you tell me? I don't know
 Should I stay or let it go? I think of the night that I made reservations just for two
 But you gave your attention to someone across the room
 I should have known right then that things just weren't right
 But I couldn't see it 'cause love had me so blind Now tell me how can I be so secure in lovin' you
 When everybody's callin' me a fool
 I can't keep holdin' on to broken promises from you
 And I can't take no more from you, yeah Don't know if we will last
 And if we do last, can I erase the past?
 Girl, can you tell me? I don't know
 Should I stay or let it go? Don't know if we're meant to be
 And if we should be, can you live faithfully?
 Girl, can you tell me? I don't know
 Should I stay or let it go? Baby, baby, time and time again I try to overlook the pain
 Couldn't think of losin' all we had to gain
 Girl, if it takes me losing you, for happiness in me
 I think that I might just have to let you go, oh Why you playing those games, huh?
 I don't see how you'll do it when I walk out the door Don't know if we will last
 And if we do last, can I erase the past?
 Girl, can you tell me? I don't know
 Should I stay or let it go? Don't know if we're meant to be
 And if we should be, can you live faithfully?
 Girl, can you tell me? I don't know
 Should I stay or let it go? Don't know if we will last
 And if we do last, can I erase the past?
 Girl, can you tell me? I don't know
 Should I stay or let it go? Don't know if we're meant to be
 And if we should be, can you live faithfully?
 Girl, can you tell me? I don't know
 Should I stay or let it go? Should I stay or should I go?
 Should I stay or should I go?
