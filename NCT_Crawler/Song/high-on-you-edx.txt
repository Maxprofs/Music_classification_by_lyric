                        Bài hát: High On You - EDX

You know I want ya sweet devotion
But we're going nowhere

You know I need it like no other
Building a love affair

You make me high
When I go low 
And when you show me left
It's the right way to go
So if you take the time
We'll brisk it up
Now that I'm ready for love

You got me high on you
You got me high on you
Oh yeah
I know, you know, we want the same
You got me going 
You got me high on you 
You got me high on you
Oh yeah yeah
I know, you know, we want the same
You got me going 
You got me high on you 

You got me high on [x6]

You are the fuel that keeps me running
Flying on liquid air

You are the reason my head is spinning
I see you everywhere

You make me high
When I go low 
And when you show me left
It's the right way to go
So if you take the time
We'll brisk it up
Now that I'm ready for love

You got me high on you
You got me high on you 
(You got me high on you baby)
I know, you know, we want the same
You got me going 
You got me high on you 
You got me high on you
Oh, oh yeah yeah
I know, you know, we want the same
You got me going 
You got me high on you 

You got me high on [x6]
