                        Bài hát: Can't Dance - Meghan Trainor

I met this shy boy, cute as hell
And grabbed him by the hand
He pulled me back, I asked what's wrong
He said, "Oh, I can't dance"
I said, "That's fine, just keep in time
And show off what you got"
If you mess up, boy
I won't mind as long as you don't stop

[Refrain]
Woah, na na, don't stop
Oh, na na, don't stop

[Chorus]
Even if you can't dance, just hold my hips
Hold my hands while I roll my hips
Even if you can't dance, I'll handle it
Follow me and don't stop
Even if you can't dance, don't stand and watch
Stand and watch while I make it hot
Even if you can't dance, I'ma make it hot
Follow me and don't stop

[Refrain]
Oh, na na, don't stop
Woah, na na, don't stop

[Verse 2]
Keep your eyes on me (woo!)
Singing, "I'ma teach you a lesson
You just gotta move in my direction" (Hey)
Keep your eyes on me (Uh-huh)
Being all anxious ain't an option
Baby, I ain't got no plans of stopping

[Refrain]
No, na na, don't stop (No, no, no, no)
Oh, na na, don't stop (He-ey)

[Chorus]
Even if you can't dance, just hold my hips
Hold my hands while I roll my hips
Even if you can't dance, I'll handle it
Follow me and don't stop
Even if you can't dance, don't stand and watch
Stand and watch while I make it hot
Even if you can't dance, I'ma make it hot
Follow me and don't stop

[Refrain]
Oh, na na, don't stop
Woah, na na, don't stop

[Bridge]
If you can't dance, just hold my hips (no no)
If you can't dance, I'll handle it
If you can't dance, don't stand and watch
If you can't dance, I'll make it hot
I'ma make it hot

[Refrain]
Woah, na na, don't stop
Oh, na na, don't stop

[Verse 3]
I met this shy boy, cute as hell
And grabbed him by the hand
He pulled me back, I asked what's wrong
He said, "Oh, I can't dance"

[Refrain]
Woah, na na, don't stop
Oh, na na, don't stop

[Chorus]
Even if you can't dance, just hold my hips
Hold my hands while I roll my hips
Even if you can't dance, I'll handle it
Follow me and don't stop
Even if you can't dance, don't stand and watch
Stand and watch while I make it hot
Even if you can't dance, I'ma make it hot
Follow me and don't stop

[Refrain]
Oh, na na, don't stop
Woah, na na, don't stop

[Bridge]
If you can't dance, just hold my hips (woo, ah)
If you can't dance, I'll handle it (can't dance, hey?)
If you can't dance, don't stand and watch (said, I got it babe)
If you can't dance, I'll make it hot (na-na-na-no, no)

[Refrain]
Oh, na na, don't stop
Woah, na na, don't stop babe
