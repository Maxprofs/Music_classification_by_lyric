                        Bài hát : Reflection (From ''Disney's Mulan'') - Lea Salonga

Look at me
I will never pass for a perfect bride
Or a perfect daughter
Can it be
I'm not meant to play this part

Now I see
That if I were truly to be myself
I would break my family's heart

Who is that girl I see
Staring straight back at me
Why is my reflection
Someone I don't know

Some how I cannot hide
Who I am though I've tried
When will my reflection show
Who I am inside

When will my reflection show
Who I am inside...
