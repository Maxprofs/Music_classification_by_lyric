                        Bài hát: Divide - Disturbed

Go!

I want to tear a big hole in what is to be
To end all this infatuation with unity
I'm seeking my salvation alone again
I never needed to be one of you anyway

Don't wanna be another player losing in this game
I'm trying to impress upon you, we're not the same
My own individuality is so unique
I'm one impressive motherfucker, now wouldn't you say?

Break apart and divide, divide, divide, divide!
You might say that I'm the last man standing now
And though you'll try, you'll never find a way to break me
You might say that I'm sick of being lost in the crowd
I hear the sirens but they're never gonna take me

I am a little more provocative than you might be
And it's your shock and then your horror on which I feed
So can you tell me what exactly does 'freedom' mean?
If I'm not free to be as twisted as I wanna be

Don't wanna be another player losing in this game
I'm trying to impress upon you, we're not the same
My psychotic mentality is so unique
I'm one aggressive motherfucker, now wouldn't you say?

Break apart and divide, divide, divide, divide!
You might say that I'm the last man standing now
And though you'll try, you'll never find a way to break me
You might say that I'm sick of being lost in the crowd
I hear the sirens but they're never gonna take me
They won't take me

Break, break, break, break, break apart and divide
Break, break, break, break, break apart and divide
Break, break, break, break, break apart and divide
And divide and divide, break apart and!

Divide, divide, divide, divide
Divide, divide, break apart and divide
Divide, divide, divide, divide
Divide, divide, break apart and

Divide, divide, divide, divide
Divide, divide, break apart and divide
Divide, divide, divide, divide
Divide, divide, divide, divide!
