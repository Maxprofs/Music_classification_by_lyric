                        Trying not to pretend that you wont happen again and again like that
Never thought it would end, but you got into my head and my head like that
You made me happy baby, but love was crazy so amazing
But it's changing, rearaging
I don't think I can take anymore

Chorus: 
Cuz the walls burned up when our love fell down
And it turned into whatever now were saying never
Feel the fire cuz it's all around and it's burning
For forever and always
We gotta let it go the other be on our way 
Look for another day, cuz it ain't the same my baby
Whatch it all fall too the ground
No happy ever after, just disaster

Didn't want it this way, now all I wanted to say
Is I loved you right
Then your love went away, and I needed you to stay
But I can't wait for you to realize
All the things I gave you, made you change you
Your dreams caved too
When I met you, now forget you
Don't want anymore

Chorus: 
Cuz the walls burned up when our love fell down
And it turned into whatever now were saying never
Feel the fire cuz it's all around and it's burning
For forever and always
We gotta let it go be on our way 
Look for another day, cuz it ain't the same my baby
Whatch it all fall too the ground
No happy ever after, just disaster

You shot the bullet you shot the bullet that killed me
Not feeling my heart beat, and now were dying
I I've been through it, I I've been through all the agony
And now my eyes are, crying, trying no more crying, 
Lying it's just a game, 
To stand up straight and I'm all right cuz my loves on his way

Yeah
Burning for forever and always

Chorus: 
Cuz the walls burned up when our love fell down
And it turned into whatever now were saying never
Feel the fire cuz it's all around and it's burning
For forever and always
We gotta let it go the other be on our way 
Look for another day, cuz it ain't the same my baby
Whatch it all fall too the ground
No happy ever after, just disaster

Cuz the walls burned up when our love fell down
And it turned into whatever now were saying never
Feel the fire cuz it's all around and it's burning
For forever and always
We gotta let it go the other be on our way 
Look for another day, cuz it ain't the same my baby
Whatch it all fall too the ground
No happy ever after, just disaster

Oh woah, cuz the walls burned up when our love fell down
And it turned into whatever now were saying never
Feel the fire cuz it's all around burning
For forever and always
We gotta let it go the other be on our way 
Look for another day, cuz it ain't the same my baby
Whatch it all fall too the ground
No happy ever after, just disaster...
