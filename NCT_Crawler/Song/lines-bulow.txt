                        Bài hát: Lines - Bulow

[Verse 1]
Another weekend (oh), I was with my friends that is true
While you were sneaking (oh), you forgot you say you'll drive me home
So took a taxi home, cold and alone in the dark on my own
So we're not speaking (no), read between the silence on the phone

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm not the kind of girl that would go flipping you off
But you're the kind of guy that cares nothing while taking it off
You'll be acting like you don't know what you did that was wrong
So I hope you pay attention while I'm singing this song

[Chorus]
Lines (ooh), there's a thing called lines (ooh)
And I said I don't care but maybe I might
Baby there's a thing called lies (ooh), but yours are white (ooh)
Don't want your sorries now, and I cross them out
A thing called lines (ooh), lines (ooh)
Lines (ooh), there's a thing called lines

[Verse 2]
My girl was swiping through
Funny how she came across you
So she swiped right on you, didn't think you'd swipe right too
I've had about enough, losing trust, and there's nothing left to do
You put a hex on us, and you've got a lot to undo

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm not the kind of girl that would go flipping you off
But you're the kind of guy that cares nothing while taking it off
You'll be acting like you don't know what you did that was wrong
So I hope you pay attention while I'm singing this song

[Chorus]
Lines (ooh), there's a thing called lines (ooh)
And I said I don't care but maybe I might
Baby there's a thing called lies (ooh), but yours are white (ooh)
Don't want your sorries now, and I cross them out
A thing called lines (ooh), lines (ooh)
Lines (ooh), there's a thing called lines

[Verse 3 (Spoken)]
So this is it, your final strike
I've given you chances, you're a lucky guy
Love is pure, it's kerosine
Neither of us are perfect, but you are just being mean
So cross my heart, leave me to die
Stick a needle in my eye
Fool me once, fool me twice, one more time then you've crossed the

[Chorus]
Line (ooh), there's a thing called lines (ooh)
And I said I don't care but maybe I might
Baby there's a thing called lies (ooh), but yours are white (ooh)
Don't want your sorries now, and I cross them out
A thing called lines (ooh), lines (ooh)
Lines (ooh), there's a thing called lines
