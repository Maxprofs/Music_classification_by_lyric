                        Bài hát: Goodbye Love (Giã Từ Tình Yêu) - V.A

When you say you are going to leave me 
i just broke down and cry
the love we had together was so strong and will never die
But now it seems to me
you're really make up your mind
saying goodbye and leaving me behind

Why can't we keep you love alive?
why must you always keep telling my lies
I thought you love me so
but now I realize
your love for me have already died

But now I'm feeling sad
and I just think of you everynight
I'm going crazy just thinking about the times we shared before 
you know you hurt me so bad
I wish you'll come to me
all you could say right now is good-bye....
