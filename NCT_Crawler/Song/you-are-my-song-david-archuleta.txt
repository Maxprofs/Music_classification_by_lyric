                        You are the song
Playing so softly in my heart
I reach for you
You seem so near and yet so far
I hope and I pray
You'll be with me someday
I know down inside
You are mine and I'm your true love
Or am I dreaming

How can I
Each time I try to say goodbye
You were there
You looked my way, I touched the sky
We can share tomorrow and forevermore
I'll be there to love you so
You are my song

I know for sure
That we were meant to fall in love
I look in your eyes
I know what you're thinkin' of

I try not to say
The words that might scare you away
I know down inside
You are mine and I'm your true love
Please, no more dreaming

How can I
Each time I try you say goodbye
You were there
You looked my way, I touched the sky
We can share tomorrow and forevermore
I'll be there
To love you so
You are my song
You are my song

We can share tomorrow and forevermore
I'll be there
To love you so
You are my song
You are my song
You are my song
                        
                    |
