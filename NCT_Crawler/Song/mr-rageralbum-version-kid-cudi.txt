                        I'm off on the adventure... (we're good)
 "This here is dedicated to all of the kids like me"
 I'm on my way to heaven
 "Wherever you are... Now"

 Birds seen flying around, you never see them too long on the ground
 You want to be one of them... (yeaah) x2
 You might hear the birds singing flying around, you never see them too long on the ground
 You want to be one of them... (yeaah) x2

 Woah Now, hey!, Mr. Raaager, Mr. Rager
 Tell me where you're going, Tell us where you're headed
 I'm off on the adventure, Mr. Raaager
 Tell me some of your stories, Tell us of your travels

 Hey!, Mr. Raaager, Mr. Rager
 Tell me where you're going, Tell us where you're headed
 I'm on my way to heaven, Mr. Raaager
 Can we tag along, Can we take the journey

 Knocked down round for round
 You're feeling like you're shot down on the ground
 When will the fantasy end, When will the heaven begin (yeaah)
 You might be knocked down round for round
 You're feeling like you're shot down on the ground
 When will the fantasy end (yeaah), When will the heaven begin (yeaah)

 Woah Now, hey!, Mr. Raaager, Mr. Rager

 Tell me where you're going, Tell us where you're headed
 I'm off on the adventure, Mr. Raaager
 Tell us some of your stories, Tell us of your travels
 Hey!, Mr. Raager, Mr. Rager
