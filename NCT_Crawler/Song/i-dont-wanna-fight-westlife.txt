                        I can't sleep, everything I ever knew
Is a lie without you
I can't breathe, when my heart is broke in two
There's no beat without you 

You're not gine but you're not here
At least that's the way it seems tonight
If we could try to end these wars
I know that we can make it right
'Cause baby

Refrain:
I don't wanna fight no more
I forgot what we were fighting for
And the loneliness that's in my heart
Won't let me be apart from you
I don't wanna have to try
Girl to live without you in my life
So I'm hoping we can start tonight
'Cause I don't wanna fight no more 

How can I leave, when everything that I adore
And everything I'm living for, girl, it's in you
I can't dream, sleepless nights have got me bad
The only dream I ever had is being with you 

I know that we can make it right
It's gonna take a little time
Let's not leave ourselves with no way out
Let's not cross that line 

(Refrain)

Remember that I made a vow that I would never let you go
I meant it then I mean it now and I want to tell you so 

(Refrain)
                        
                    |
