                        Bài hát: Lovebird - Leona Lewis

I will lay down next to you
Stay in bed all afternoon
We were birds of a feather
We were always together
And I never will forget
All the little things you said
And that beautiful summer
You used to call me your love bird.

But the time went on
The wind has blown
And I have grown
And I started a feeling
That my wings have been broken

And I can't believe that I would ever want to be set free
But I just can't stay

So your love bird's flying away
Your love bird's flying away
'Cause my heart's been stuck in a cage
Gotta sing my song so pretty, *** *** diddy
And I'll miss you everyday
'Cause there's nothing left to say
Gotta sing my song so pretty, *** *** diddy

I want the world at my feet
Even if it's bittersweet
I wanna stand on my own and
Hold my heart in my own hands.
'Cause I've begun to see
That you and me
Are different breeds.
So I gotta be leaving,
Gotta get back to breathing

And I can't believe that I would ever want to be set free
But I just can't stay

So your love bird's flying away
Your love bird's flying away
'Cause my heart's been stuck in a cage
Gotta sing my song so pretty, *** *** diddy
And I'll miss you everyday
'Cause there's nothing left to say
Gotta sing my song so pretty, *** *** diddy

And you'll always be
A part of me,
You made me who I am
But I gotta say, I'm not afraid
To test my wing span
'cause they say if you love something let it go, let it go, let it go
Open up the gate,
'cause your love birds flying away

Your love bird's flying away
'Cause my heart's been stuck in a cage
Gotta sing my song so pretty, *** *** diddy
And I'll miss you everyday
'Cause there's nothing left to say
Gotta sing my song so pretty, *** *** diddy.
