                        Ohh, oh, ohh, oh, ohh, oh
 Ohh, oh, ohh, woo, woo What child is this
 Who laid to rest
 On Marys lap is sleeping? Oh, whom angels greet
 With anthems sweet
 While the good shepherds
 Watch our keeping
 Mmm So bring Him incense, gold and myrrh,
 Come peasant, king to own Him
 The King of kings salvation brings,
 Let loving hearts enthrone Him
 Ohh This, this is Christ the King,
 Whom shepherds guard and Angels sing;
 Haste, haste, to bring Him laud,
 The Babe, the Son of Mary. For raise, for raise this song on high
 His mother sings her lullaby
 Oh joyful, joyful Christ is born
 The Babe, the Son of Mary (Mary) What child is this
 What child is this (what child is this yeah)
 This, this is Christ the king
 Whom shepherds guard and Angels sing
 Haste, haste to bring him more
 The Babe (oh the Babe) and the Son (and the Son) of Mary (of Mary, Mary, Mary) Of Mary (of Mary)
 Of Mary
