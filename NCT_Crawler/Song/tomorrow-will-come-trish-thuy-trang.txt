                        Bài hát: Tomorrow Will Come - Trish Thùy Trang

As time goes by everyday of my life,
How I long for yesterday
Slowly years have gone and come
And I know that you'll wait for me 'til the end
Looking back on days of the past that we had so long ago
I can't hide these feelings all inside,
My love continues to grow

Without you here, everything is unclear
All that's left of me and you
I'll wait endlessly for you and for us
For a love, I'll never let go

All my life I'll wait everyday, everynight for your return
You and I together for all time, our flame forever will burn

Oh so far away, I'm holding on to yesterday
I will wait tomorrow, tomorrow will come again

As time goes by everyday of my life,
How I long for yesterday
Slowly years have gone and come
And I know that you'll wait for me 'til the end
Looking back on days of the past that we had so long ago
I can't hide these feelings all inside,
My love continues to grow

Oh so far away, I'm holding on to yesterday
I will wait tomorrow, tomorrow will come again

Without you here, everything is unclear
All that's left of me and you
I'll wait endlessly for you and for us
For a love I'll never let go

All my life I'll wait everyday, everynight for your return
You and I together for all time, our flame forever will burn
You and I together for all time, our flame forever will burn
                        
                    |
