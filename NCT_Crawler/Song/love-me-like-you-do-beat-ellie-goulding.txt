                        Bài hát: Love Me Like You Do Beat - Ellie Goulding

You're the light, you're the night
You're the color of my blood
you're the cure, you're the pain
You're the only thing I wanna touch
Never knew that it could mean so much
So much

You're the fear, I don't care
'Cause I've never been so high
Follow me to the dark
Let me take you pass outside the lights
Even see the world you brought to life
To life

So love me like you do
Lo-lo-love me like you do
Love me like you do
Lo-lo-love me like you do
Touch me like you do
To-to-touch me like you do
What do you waiting for?

Fading in, fading out
On the edge of paradise
Every inch of your skin
Is a holy grail I got to find
Only you can set my heart on fire
On fire

Yeah, I let you set the pace
'Cause I'm not thinking straight
My head's spinning around
I can't see clear anymore
What do you waiting for?

Love me like you do
Lo-lo-love me like you do
Love me like you do
Lo-lo-love me like you do
Touch me like you do
To-to-touch me like you do
What do you waiting for?
Love me like you do
Lo-lo-love me like you do
Love me like you do
Lo-lo-love me like you do
Touch me like you do
To-to-touch me like you do
What do you waiting for?

I let you set the pace
'Cause I'm not thinking straight
My head's spinning around
I can't see clear no more
What do you waiting for?

Love me like you do
Lo-lo-love me like you do
Love me like you do
Lo-lo-love me like you do
Touch me like you do
To-to-touch me like you do
What do you waiting for?
Love me like you do
Lo-lo-love me like you do
Love me like you do
Lo-lo-love me like you do
Touch me like you do
To-to-touch me like you do
What do you waiting for?
