                        Don't leave me out in all this pain .Don't leave out in the rain .come back and bring back my smile .come and take these tears away .I need your arms to hold me now .the nights are so unkind.bring back those nights when . I held you beside me

 *Unbreak my heart 
 say you'll love me again 
 Undo this hurt you caused 
 when you walk out the door 
 And walked outta my life
 Uncry these tears
 J cried so many nights
 Unbreak my heart,my heart
Take back that sad word goodbye 
Bring back the joy to my life
Don'd leave me here with these tears
Come and kiss this pain away
I can't forget the day you left
Time is so unkind
And life is so cruel
Without you here beside me


 *Unbreak my heart 
 say you'll love me again 
 Undo this hurt you caused 
 when you walk out the door 
 And walked outta my life
 Uncry these tears
 J cried so many nights
 Unbreak my heart,my heart

Don't leave me in all this pain
Don't leave me out in the rain
Bring back those nights
When I held you beside me

 (Repeat)
Unbreak my heart 
come back and say you loved me 
Unbreak my heart
Sweet darling
Without you I just can't go on can't go on.
