                        Somewhere in the back of my mind
Secretly I know you will find
Way amongst the blushing and glow
Teach me all the things I don't show

Mystery's a beautiful thing
What a gift a woman can bring
Never let it out just like that
Let him slowly figure it out

How can a flower bloom
Just over a day?
And at night
You've got to let the water drain in

I didn't want to fall in love with you
I didn't want to know the things I knew
It wasn't until I look into the mirror
Denial

You were like a power of nature
Telephatic beautiful creature
Understanding all my weakness
Patient, love and know when it reaches

Cynical and that was just me
You were never supposed to be
Part of what I would call amazing
It took so long to finally see
How can a flower bloom
Just over a day?
And at night
You've got to let the water drain in

I didn't want to fall in love with you
I didn't want to know the things I knew
It wasn't until I look into the mirror
Denial

I didn't want to fall in love with you
I didn't want to know the things I knew
It wasn't until I look into the mirror
Denial

I see the way the pain goes like open minds for us
No complicated barriers to hold us back

I didn't want to fall in love with you
I didn't want to know the things I knew
It wasn't until I look into the mirror
Denial

I didn't want to fall in love with you
I didn't want to know the things I knew
It wasn't until I look into the mirror
                        
                    |
