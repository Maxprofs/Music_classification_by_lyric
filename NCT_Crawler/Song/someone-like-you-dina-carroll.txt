 I've been searching a long time
 For someone exactly like you
 I've been travelling all around the world
 Waiting for you to come through
 Chorus
 Someone like you
 Makes it all worthwhile
 Someone like you
 Keeps me satisfied
 Someone exactly like you
 I've been doing some soul searching
 To find out where you're at
 I've been up and down the highway
 In all kinds of foreign lands
 Chorus
 I've been all around the world
 Marching to the beat of a different drum
 But just lately I have realised
 The best is yet to come
 Chorus
                        
                    |
