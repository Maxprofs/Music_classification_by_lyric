                        Song: Heaven Sent Me You - John Michael Montgomery

I've never seen blue eyes
 Filled with so much love
 I never thought I'd find
 What I found in your touch Someone up there must like me
 'Cause I'm lookin' at the proof
 There's no doubt about it
 Heaven sent me you Heaven sent me you
 To make my life complete
 An angel from above
 To watch over me What makes it even better
 Is you feel the same way too
 There's no doubt about it
 Heaven sent me you Every moment that we share
 Will live forever in my mind
 The memories that we make
 Are sure to outlast time I know when I hold you close
 I'm holdin' love that's true
 There's no doubt about it
 Heaven sent me you Heaven sent me you
 To make my life complete
 An angel from above
 To watch over me What makes it even better
 Is you feel the same way too
 There's no doubt about it
 Heaven sent me you
 There's no doubt about it
 Heaven sent me you
                        
                    |
