                        Bài hát : Weekend Has Come (Remix 2013) - DJ HS145

Weekend has come
i see you again
MOnday to fri
i wair for the time with you
And all my love
I lay in your arms
I'm kissing your lips
be no more away from you
so that is the time
I'm working on me
Forgot all the lonely nights with TV
I think that will be never
My future i swear
Now what we need
A comeback again forever
                        
                    |
