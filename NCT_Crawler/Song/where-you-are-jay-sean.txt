                        Do you know the feeling
 When sometimes you wake up young, and sometimes you wake up old,
 And sometimes youre so in love,
 And do you know the feeling,
 When their love just comes undone,
 And i cant figure it out,What somethings got me unlock,
 but you my baby! There were some times i put up a fight
 But when something is right, you know that is right
 And i dont wanna think, its simple to me, youre the one
 And baby thats why And i cant help it, i gotta be where you are,
 Like the sky holding the stars,
 Like the strings on my guitar,
 I wanna be where you are,
 Like the sand thats on the beach,
 Like a model in a magazine,
 It dont mean a thing, if were apart,
 I wanna be where you are,
 Where you are, where you are,
 And baby thats why i wanna be where you are, And baby everytime youre around,
 Youre the one that always holds me down,
 And dont even ask for a thing, no,
 You make a real win, even when things aint perfect,
 Youre the one that keeps the fire burning,
 And thats the reason why, i aint leaving And i cant help it, i gotta be where you are,
 Like the sky holding the stars,
 Like the strings on my guitar,
 I wanna be where you are,
 Like the sand thats on the beach,
 Like a model in a magazine,
 It dont mean a thing, if were apart,
 I wanna be where you are,
 Where you are, where you are,
 And thats it baby i wanna be where you are, Yeah yeah yeah..I wanna be with you
 Yeah yeah yeah..Baby i wanna be with you
 Yeah yeah yeah..Oh yeah babe
 I gotta be, i gotta be with you baby And i cant help it, i gotta be where you are
 Like the sky holding the stars
 Like the strings on my guitar
 I wanna be where you are
 Like the sand thats on the beach
 Like a model in a magazine
 It dont mean a thing, if were apart
 I wanna be where you are
 Where you are, where you are
 Said i wanna be where you are
