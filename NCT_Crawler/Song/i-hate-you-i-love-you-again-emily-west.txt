                        Bài hát: I Hate You, I Love You Again - Emily West

Oh, what a night we had. 
Felt good at the time, now i’m sad. 
I wanted to hit you, but instead i kissed you,
Rained on cigarettes. Spirit soaked cinnamons, 
Me acting funny – pretending- i don’t miss your calls,
You’ve assumed i’ve moved on, 
Like a song memorized, and never felt at all.

Once we were lovers, 
Thought it’d never end. 
Felt like forever. 
I hate you.
I love you, again.

Saw you in the window of a bar.
Ex-lovers in two separate cars.
One says to the other,
“hey, how’ve you been?” 
Made to discover, 
Your pretty new friend.

Once we were lovers,
Thought it’d never end.
Felt like forever.


Now i hate you.
I love you,
Again.

Oooooohh how many times, do i gotta bend. 
I just can’t go on, missing a friend.

Once we were lovers.
Past is past. 
Fool myself to feel like that,
Should have never ever gone in.

It’s hard enough to see you,
And even shake your hand. 
I love you, so damn hard. 

I hate you.
I hate you. 
I hate you,
I love you, again.
