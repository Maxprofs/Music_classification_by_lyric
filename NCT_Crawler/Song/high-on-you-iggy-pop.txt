                        I like your wooden door, baby
 I never want to leave, baby
 If I could rule the night, baby
 I'd turn it into white
 That wouldn't ever leave us dry I'm getting high on you
 I'm getting high on you
 I'm getting high on you
 High on you I like your rugged cross, baby
 I don't pray in churches, baby
 I got nowhere to worship, baby
 Because it isn't him
 I don't need a monument I'm getting high on you
 I'm getting high on you
 I'm getting high on you
 High on you Terrorist in my heart
 Tearin' it all apart
 Terrorist in my heart
 Tearin' it all apart I love the way you feel, baby
 The mornin' startin' drunk, baby
 Drinking of your soul, baby
 And everything I know
 Digs the way your body glows I'm getting high on you
 I'm getting high on you
 I'm getting high on you
 High on you I'm getting high on you
 I'm getting high on you
 I'm getting high on you
 I'm getting high Corrupting in the air
 I really need you
 You got two play rides
 I really love them
 Are we getting high?
 Are we getting high?
