                        Bài hát: Three Candle Lights - Phương Thảo

Dad's the light of gold
Mom's the light of blue
Baby's the light of rose
Three candle lights will shine

Hah hah hah hah hah
Shining a family
Family family
Giving the sun for days
Giving the happiness

Family family
It’s hard to go away
So warm as coming home
Shining shining the ma’s the love
Shining shining the fa’s the love
Shining shining you and me
Shining shining our family

Dad’s the light of gold
Mom’s the light of blue
Baby’s the light of rose
Three candle lights will shine

Ha ha ha ha ha
Shining a family
Family family
Giving the sun for days
Giving the happiness

Family family
Sharing up and down
Until the final day
Shining shining the ma’s the love
Shining shining the fa’s the love
Shining shining you and me
Shining shining our family
