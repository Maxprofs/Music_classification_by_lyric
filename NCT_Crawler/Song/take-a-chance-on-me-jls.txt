                        You're so scared to fall in love
Cuz you end up in the dust
Everytime everytime...

Now you see us all the same
Like our words are just a game
Spitting lies, dirty lies

I know you know
There's something here
But you cannot get pas the fear
I can help you make it clear...

So when you feel like trying again
Reach out, take my hand
So how great it could be
To fall in love with someone you can trust

Who would never give up
Cuz you're all that he needs
Baby take a chance on me
Baby take a chance on, oh oh
Baby take a chance on me
Baby take a chance on, oh oh oh

You give 100& but you've never seen a cent
They're so blind, they're so blind
Cuz i'm looking at your face
And the world's a better place
In your eyes, lovely eyes

I know you know
There's something here
But you cannot get pas the fear
I can help you make it clear...

So when you feel like trying again
Reach out, take my hand
So how great it could be
To fall in love with someone you can trust

Who would never give up
Cuz you're all that he needs
Baby take a chance on me
Baby take a chance on, oh oh
Baby take a chance on me
Baby take a chance on, oh oh oh

You got nothing to lose baby,
But you won't know if you don't try
Please don't leave me asking why
So when you're ready to choose baby
I'll be here with open arms
With the same in love in my heart

So when you feel like trying again
Reach out, take my hand
So how great it could be
To fall in love with someone you can trust

Who would never give up
Cuz you're all that he needs
Baby take a chance on me
Baby take a chance on, oh oh
Baby take a chance on me
Baby take a chance on, oh oh oh

So when you feel like trying again...
