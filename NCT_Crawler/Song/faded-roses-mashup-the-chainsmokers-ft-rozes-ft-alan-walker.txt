You were the shadow to my light
Did you feel us?
Another start, you fade away
Afraid our aim is out of sight, wanna see us
ALIVE
Where are you now?
Oh, I'll be your daydream, I'll wear you favorite thing
We could be beautiful
Get drunk on the good life, I'll take you to paradise
Say you'll never let me go
Where are you now? Atlantis?
Under the sea, under the sea
Where are you now?
Another dream
The monster's running wide inside of me
I'm faded
Ahh,ahh,ahh
Ahh,ahh,ahh
Ahh,ahh,ahh
Say you'll never let me go
These shallow water's never met
What I needed
I'm letting go, a deeper dive
Eternal silence of the sea, I'm breathing
Alive
Where are you now?
Deep in my bones, I can feel you
Take me back to a time when only we knew
Hideaway
We could waste the night with an old film
Smoke a little weed on the couch in the back room
Hideaway
Say you'll never let me go
Say you'll never let me go
Where are you now?
Atlantis 
Under the sea, under the sea
Where are you now?
Another dream
The monster's running wide inside of me
I'm faded
Say you'll never let me go
