                        Bài Hát: Olé - John Newman, Calvin Harris

 [Verse 1]
Lowkey, you won't tell none of your friends about me
You won't tell them I occupy your dreams and your thoughts
Look at what we have started
I feel so good when I leave your apartment

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I know, there's no telling how far you can go
And you won't want to hear about my love and my lust
Babe that I have been feeling
I kiss you once, then I stare at the ceiling
[Chorus]
Olé, you bring too much sunlight to my day
And only you can chase the pain away
You bring too much sunlight to my day, my day

[Verse 2]
My heart speaks
I ain't seen you or been with you for weeks
But I see online that you've begun to be
A good girl and take trips with your boyfriend
Being attentive, continue to pretend

[Pre-Chorus 2]
But no, cause there's no telling how far you can go
You've hidden my name on your phone so you can
Call me to tell me you've been going through hell
Left him alone and you booked in a hotel

[Chorus]
Olé, you bring too much sunlight to my day
And only you can chase the pain away
You bring too much sunlight to my day, my day

[Bridge]
I can't control myself around you
I can't control myself around you
I can't control myself around you
I can't control myself around you
I can't control myself around you
And I'm singing...

[Chorus]
Olé, you bring too much sunlight to my day
And only you can chase the pain away
You bring too much sunlight to my day, my day
Olé, you bring too much sunlight to my day
And only you can chase the pain away
You bring too much sunlight to my day, my day
