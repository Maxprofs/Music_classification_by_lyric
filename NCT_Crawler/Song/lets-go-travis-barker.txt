So put your hands together let's go let's go let's go
Everybody let's go let's go let's go

Let's trust in love (Come on sing it with me)
Let's start it now (Come on dance with me)
So put your hands together let's go let's go let's go
Everybody let's go let's go let's go

Sometimes we feel alone
Sometimes we feel afraid
But you and me together
We can do anything

That that that's alright
Smile and say it's alright
Let's get together
Come on everybody let's go

Some days I don't wanna go on (Let's go)
Some nights I don't wanna be strong (Let's go)
But when I can hear your voice
I can wake up, I can start it

Now we are one (One! One!)
We gonna get together now (Go! Go!)
So put your hands together let's go let's go let's go
Everybody let's go let's go let's go

Let's trust in love (Come on sing it with me)
Let's start it now (Come on dance with me)
So put your hands together let's go let's go let's go
Everybody let's go let's go let's go
Welcome to ***

On and on and on, we gonna party
On and on and on, we gonna make it

Eveyone tonight's the night
Everything's alright now

Now we are one
We gonna get together now
So put your hands together let's go let's go let's go
Everybody let's go let's go let's go

Let's trust in love (Come on sing it with me)
Let's start it now (Come on dance with me)
