Just something about you
The way I'm looking at you
While your looking at me
You're scared now
Right
Don't feel me baby
You feel good right
I kinda noticed you one night
You made a front face
It was kinda weird for me to see someone so fine
If its up to me your face will change
If you smile then that should set the tone
Just be limber
And if you let go the music will move your bones
Just remember and sing this song with me
Ain't nobody love you like I love you
You're the girl and that's what makes me trust you
Late at night I talk to you
You will know the difference when I touch you
People are so phony
I know cuz they own me
Aren't you sick of the same thing
They say so and so is dating
Well it doesn't matter anymore
Cuz we're here tonight
You know I'll make you happy
I'll change your life
If you give me that chance to be your man
I won't let you down baby
Here baby hold my jacket and then
Maybe we'll fly tonight
I just wanna love ya baby
Girl
Ma whatchu wanna do?
I be feeling you
Let your friends see
I got feelings too
All me and you
Flip on the stage show
In the mall kick it but we keep it low
What the hell they say now?
With the same blow
Lookee here I keep it here with the same glow ???
Look at me I say yeah with the same dough
We're staying tight
You're my every night
You got me sleeping in the same bed every night.
Yo mommy you're serving the best
Take a few shots
Let it burn in your chest
We can ride now
Put Nerd in the deck
Funny how a few words turn into sex
Play all ...something something...turn in th braids???
All ya had Nigga swerve in the lanes
The name is malicious and I burn every track

You know I used to dream about this when I was a little boy
Never thought it would end up this way
Drums
You know your special right?
Yeah
If you think about it
Two people
Its destiny
They'll do what they do
Now that's what it is
Now everybody dance
