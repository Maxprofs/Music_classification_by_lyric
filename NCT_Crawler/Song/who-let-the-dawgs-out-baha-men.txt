she really want to skip town, 
Get back gruffy, back scruffy, 
Get back you flea infested mongrel! 

Gonna tell myself "hey, man, no get angry" {Hey-ya, Yippie, Yi, Yo} 
To any girls calling them canine {Hey! Yippie, Yi, Yo} 
But they tell me "Hey Man, It's part of the Party!" {Yippie Yi, Yo} 
You put a woman in front and her man behind {Yippie, Yi, Yo}

Well, if I am a dog,
the party is on: 
I gotta get my groove,
'Cause my mind done gone. 
Do you see the rays comin' from my eye 
Walkin' through the place that Digi-man is breakin' it down? 
Me and my white short shorts 
And I can't see color
Any color will do
I'll stick on you that's why they call me "pit bull"
'Cause I'm the man of the land 
When they see me they say...hooooo
