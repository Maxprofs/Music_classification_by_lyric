 And on my briefs, she get on my nerves
 But I don't say *** cause she too sweet
 She ride this dick up and down the street
 She like when it hurt, I like when it's free
 It must be the bird, it must be the bees
 I think I said I love her, I was half asleep
 I was caught in the moment
 Yea, then I was gone in the mornin'
 She called my phone in the mornin' and started moanin' and groanin'
 While I be home in a moment
 She say she work tonight, you better work tonight
 And leave out that motherfucker with some merchandise
 I ain't playin' with ya, you got some *** with ya

 If I put her any closer she'll be riding in the cockpit
 Took her to Benihanas, she can't even hold the chopsticks
 She put her face down and hold her ass up like a hostage
