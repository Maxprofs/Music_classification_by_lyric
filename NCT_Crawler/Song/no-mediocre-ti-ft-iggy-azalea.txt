All I *** is bad bitches
I don’t want no mediocre
I don’t want no mediocre
I don’t want no mediocre
No
Bad bitches only
Ain't no mediocre
Don’t want no mediocre
I won’t hit no mediocre
You a bad bitch
Stuntin on the mediocre
Stuntin on the mediocre
Stuntin on the mediocre
7 bitches with me and ain't none of them mediocre
From they head to they toes they so far from mediocre

Right hand in the air
I solemnly swear
I never *** a bitch if she don’t do her hair
No more, you won’t get no dick if there’s a bush down there
Girl I should see nothing but pussy when I look down there
You come *** with a nigga what better to do
He call to ask how you doin tell him better than you, yeah
I’m kicked back with four pieces like a kit kat
Me ***ing if you ain’t a dime just forget that
Pretty face fat ass, if she don’t have
Have one of these, well I think I’ll pass
I just handed her the keys to a new drop Jag
When she took it I took it back
You shoulda asked for a Benz
That’s mediocre bitch

All I *** is bad bitches
I don’t want no mediocre
I don’t want no mediocre
I don’t want no mediocre
No
Bad bitches only
Ain't no mediocre
Don’t want no mediocre
I won’t hit no mediocre
You a bad bitch
Stuntin on the mediocre
Stuntin on the mediocre
Stuntin on the mediocre
7 bitches with me and ain't none of them mediocre
From they head to they toes they so far from mediocre


Heard he want to lay it down on Iggy Iggy
Gave it to him twice
Now he want a 3, Mike Bibby diva
But I need a bad boy
Rest in peace Whitney pardon me
But I don’t think none of these bitches ***ing with me
Want a billboard bitch stop running in place
Heels on me saying gimme 6 inches of space
Courtside while designer frames cover my face
Now everybody in the game wanna get em a taste
I’m still Grand Hustle first lady *** you pay me
Bet he won't go 12 rounds with the million dollar baby
I can change your life quick stop playing with me
And if you ain't talking money what you saying to me

I'm in Brazil with a bitch
Catch me in a mansion in the hills with a bitch
Get her out *** tennis shoes
Throw some heels on a bitch
I’m the type of nigga split a mil with a bitch
Hold up, only if she bad though
Out here trying to find someone that better than my last go
Take her to my castle
Drown her in my cash flow
Say your dick so little she can fit it in her ***
Told me she can write this ***
No further than a cab go
Said I got that don dick
She wanna be my tutor
So she give me brain getting head on the scooter
Had sex on the beach
From Bermuda up to Cuba
I done ***ed a lot of dimes
But I’m looking for a cute bitch
You the ***
What she say when she got to sit
When I ain't around
Give a damn who you do it with
Super thick pretty face
Ménage à venti
20 at the same time
Wanna get ya rent paid

All I *** is bad bitches
I don’t want no mediocre
I don’t want no mediocre
I don’t want no mediocre
No
Bad bitches only
Ain't no mediocre
Don’t want no mediocre
I won’t hit no mediocre
You a bad bitch
Stuntin on the mediocre
Stuntin on the mediocre
Stuntin on the mediocre
7 bitches with me and ain't none of them mediocre
From they head to they toes they so far from mediocre
