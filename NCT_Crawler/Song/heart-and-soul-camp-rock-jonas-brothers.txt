                        Oh yeah!
Alright, ohh

Gather 'round guys
It's time to start listenin'
Practice makes perfect
But perfects not workin'

There's a lot more to music
Than knowing where your cue's gonna be
You can play all the right notes
But that don't mean you movin' me

But if you can jump
Like David Lee Roth
Or pump your fist like you're Bruce the Boss

If you got heart and soul
You can rock and roll
Rock and roll

Strum it, drum it
Slide across and run it

The stage is your home if you learn how to own it
Like the greats did
There's no way that you can fake it

You've got to feel the beat before you can move
Even though you're not wearing blue suede shoes
Makin' mistakes,
But that won't matter
If you can swagger like ol' Mick Jagger


If you got heart and soul
You can rock and roll
You can rock and roll
Solo

If you live and die
For the music inside
If the one for five never gets old
Then you can rock and roll
Rock and roll

Alright now take it low
Now I need the spotlight to hit me
Right here
As the crowd starts to cheer
I need the fan to blow right through my rock star hair
Right here

If you can scream like Axel Rose
Or sing like Christina show after show

If you've got heart and soul
You can rock and roll

If you've got heart and soul
You can rock and roll
You can rock and roll
Ohh yeah
Ohh Ohh
Yeah

You can rock and roll
                        
                    |
