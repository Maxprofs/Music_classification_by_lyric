                        Words and Music by JOHN LENNON
-------------------------------
Grow old along with me.
The best is yet to be.
When our time has come
we will be as one.
God bless our love!
God bless our love!

Grow old along with me.
Two branches of one tree.
Face the setting sun
when the day is done.
God bless our love!
God bless our love!
Spending our lives together.
Man and wife together.
World without end!
World without end!

Grow old along with me.
Whatever fate decrees
we will see it through.
For our love is true.
God bless our love!
God bless our love!
