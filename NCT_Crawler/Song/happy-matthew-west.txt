                        Three o'clock, tripping down the sidewalk
 Looking like a fool with a pocket full of questions
 I was living in the worry, moving in a hurry
 In the wrong direction But then suddenly it hit me
 It doesn't really matter 'cause I got you with me
 And I think I don't have to be so
 Down, down, down, down, down I should be happy, I should be happy, yeah, yeah
 I should be living up these days
 Just like I know who runs this place
 Now that you found me, I should be happy Three thirty, got a little dirty
 Fear stuck its foot out and I tripped on the same lie
 That voice screaming into my head
 Pushing me to play dead, saying "Don't you even try" But how can I claim to be free
 When I carry more chains the world when they see me?
 And I don't wanna be the fool who stays
 Down, down, down, down, down I should be happy, I should be happy, yeah, yeah
 I should be living up these days
 Just like I know who runs this place
 Now that you found me, I should be happy Now I'm not talking 'bout a smile so fake
 While the world takes pictures 24/7
 I just want my faith to be a little more real
 What you see is what you get, what you see is how I feel, yeah, yeah Well, I should be happy, I should be happy, yeah, yeah
 I should be living up these days
 Just like I know who runs this place
 Now that you found me, I should be happy I wanna be happy
 Lord, I need to be happy
 Why can't I be happy
 Ooh, why can't we all just be happy
