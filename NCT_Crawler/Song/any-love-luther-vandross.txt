                        I speak to myself sometimes, and I say, "Oh my
 In a lot of ways, you're a lucky guy and
 Now all you need is a chance to try any love" In my heart there's a need to shout
 Dyin', screamin', cryin' let me out, hey
 Are all those feelings that want to touch any love? What a world for the lonely guy
 Sometimes I feel I'm gonna lose my mind, my mind
 Can anybody tell me just where to find any love, any love? And oh, everyone needs a love no doubt, any love, any love
 And oh, everybody feels alone without any love, any love
 And I know there's a love waiting to enter my life, enter my life Every day as I live, I try to think positive
 And I, I pray for someone good to come, any love Ooh, love is sweet and so divine
 And I can't wait for my love life to shine, to shine
 Can anybody tell me where I can find any love, any love? And oh, everyone needs a love no doubt, any love, any love
 Everybody feels alone without any love, any love
 And I know there's someone waiting for me
 To enter my life, come into my life Suddenly out of the clear, blue sky, lonely tears start to fill my eyes
 I can weep, but I refuse to cry, I've got to keep holdin' on
 I've got to be very strong, to keep holdin' on Everyone needs a love no doubt, any love, any love
 And oh, everybody feels alone without any love, any love
 And I know, I know, I know, I know now she'll come into my life
 Into my, into my life Everyone needs a love no doubt, any love, any love
 Everybody feels lonely without any love, any love, any love yeah
 And I need you, yeah should've been in my mind, in my mind
 Everyone needs a love no doubt, any love, any love
 Everybody feels lonely without any love, any love, ooh
