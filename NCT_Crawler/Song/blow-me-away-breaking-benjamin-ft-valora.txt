                        They fall in line, one at a time, ready to play
 I can't see them anyway
 No time to lose, we've got to move, steady your helm
 I am losing sight again Fire your guns, it's time to roll, blow me away
 I will stay in the mess ive made
 After the fall, we'll shake it off
 Show me the way Only the strongest will survive
 Lead me to heaven when we die
 I am a shadow on the wall
 I'll be the one to save us all There's nothing left, so save your breath, lying in wait
 Caught inside this tidal wave
 Your cover's blown, no where to go, holding your fate
 Loaded, I will walk alone Fire your guns, it's time to roll, blow me away
 I will stay in the mess ive made
 After the fall, we'll shake it off
 Show me the way Only the strongest will survive
 Lead me to heaven when we die
 I am a shadow on the wall
 I'll be the one to save us all You wanted it bad
 Don't fight back now
 Here comes
 Fight Only the strongest will survive
 Lead me to heaven when we die
 I am a shadow on the wall
 I'll be the one to save us all Save us all
