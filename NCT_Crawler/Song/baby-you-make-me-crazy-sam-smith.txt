                        Bài hát: Baby, You Make Me Crazy - Sam Smith

You say that you're leaving
But I don't think I can let go
When you put the phone down
I began to cry
What are you to do
When the person that you love just says no?
Boy, get yourself together
Move on with your life

So I'm gonna play my favourite rhythm
Got to get you out my system
I would do anything to keep you off my mind
I'm gonna have to call my sisters
Be around the ones who listen
Anything to drown you out tonight

Baby
You make me crazy
Why'd you have to fill my heart with sorrow?
Save me
Make it all hazy
So I don't think about you 'til tomorrow

It wasn't enough
But you could've had the guts to face me
It would have meant so much
If you'd looked me in the eye
Why do I always fall for the ones who have no courage?
I must see some kind of beauty in their eyes

So I'm gonna play my favourite rhythm
Got to get you out my system
I would do anything to keep you off my mind
I'm gonna have to call my sisters
Be around the ones who listen
Anything to drown you out tonight

Baby
You make me crazy
Why'd you have to fill my heart with sorrow?
Save me
Make it all hazy
So I don't think about you 'til tomorrow

Baby
You make me crazy
Why'd you have to fill my heart with sorrow?
Save me
Make it all hazy
So I don't think about you 'til tomorrow

Baby
You make me crazy
Why'd you have to fill my heart with sorrow?
Save me
Make it all hazy
So I don't think about you 'til tomorrow
