                        "What About Me"

There's a little boy waitin' at the counter of the corner shop
He's been waitin' down there
Waiting half the day
We never ever see him from the top
He gets pushed around
Knocked to the ground
But he gets to his feet and he says...

What about me
It isn't fair
I've had enough now I wasnt my share
Can't you see
I wanna live
But you just take more then you give

There's a pretty girl standing at the counter of the corner shop

She's been waitin' back there
Waitin' for her dreams
Her dreams walk in and I begged 'em to stop
Well she's not too proud
To cry out loud
She runs to the street and she screams:

What about me
It isn't fair
I've had enough now I wasn't my share
Can't you see
I wanna live
But you just take more then you give

So take a step back and see the little people
They may be young
But they're the ones who make the big people big
So listen
As they whisper
What about me

Now I'm standing on the corner all the world's gone home
Nobody's changed
Nobody's been saved
And I'm feeling cold and alone
I guess I'm lucky
I smile a lot
But sometimes I wish for more
Then I go...

What about me
It isn't fair
I've had enough now I wasn't my share
Can't you see
I wanna live
But you just take more what about me
It isn't fair
I've had enough now I want my share
Can't you see
I wanna live
But you just take more
You just take more
You just take more then you give

What about me
What about me
What about me
