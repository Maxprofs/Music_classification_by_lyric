Jeremy Green - Heart Strings

Keep me suspended in the air just like a puppet
If you keep tugging on my arm you're gonna hurt it
I'm feeling so beneath the real I'm gasping for air
Cos I don't wanna try the nothing then it's not there

You keep playing with me
And damn, it just feels so mean
You got me strung up on the motion baby why can't you see
It's kind of funny to me
The way you say you love me
I can't believe I tried to trust you but you always *** me

My heart is swinging in the air cos you are holding
(Keep pulling on my heart strings, pulling on my heart strings)
You throw my head and everywhere, and you don't know it
(Keep pulling on my heart strings, pulling on my heart strings)

(Pulling on my heart strings, pulling on my heart strings)
(Pulling on my heart strings, pulling on my heart strings)
(Pulling on my heart strings, pulling on my heart strings)
(Pulling on my heart strings, pulling on my heart strings)

I wear my heart out on my sleeve but you just don't care
I lose my footing, hit the ground and you are not there
Now that I learned to pick myself up it's just not that fair
The way you think you got a hold on my heart

My heart is swinging in the air cos you are holding
(Keep pulling on my heart strings, pulling on my heart strings)
You throw my head and everywhere, and you don't know it
(Keep pulling on my heart strings, pulling on my heart strings)

Who do you think you are
I only have one heart
And I just can't avoid to let you toy with me again
I try to understand why you wanna control these hands
You make it hard for me to even call myself a man

My heart is swinging in the air cos you are holding
(Keep pulling on my heart strings, pulling on my heart strings)
You throw my head and everywhere, and you don't know it
(Keep pulling on my heart strings, pulling on my heart strings)

My heart is swinging in the air cos you are holding
(Keep pulling on my heart strings, pulling on my heart strings)
You throw my head and everywhere, and you don't know it
(Keep pulling on my heart strings, pulling on my heart strings)

(Pulling on my heart strings)
(Pulling on my heart strings)
(Pulling on my heart strings)
(Pulling on my heart strings)
