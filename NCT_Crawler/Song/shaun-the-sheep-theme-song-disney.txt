                        You’ve gotta meet this fella
living down on the farm
because he’s pretty cool and mellow
he’s the king of the barn

When there’s mayhem in the meadow
he keeps his crew on track
for all his legendary adventures
they should put up a plaque!

For shaun the sheep
He’s Shaun the sheep
He even mucks about with those who cannot bleat
Keep it in mind
He’s one of a kind
Oh ... life’s a treat with Shaun the Sheep

He’s Shaun the sheep .. He’s Shaun the sheep
He’s Shaun the sheep .. He’s Shaun the sheep
He doesn’t miss a trick or ever lose a beat

Perhaps one day
You’ll find a way
To......
Come and meet with Shaun the sheep

His a brave courageous leader
and he’s not to get recruit
he’s a friendly kinda geezer
who’s remarkably astute
he’s a father of invention
with a charismatic knack
for causing havoc in the pasture
“Behind the farmers back”

He’s Shaun the sheep
He’s Shaun the sheep
he’s not afraid to make the intellectual leap
for brains and gile
with a wink and a smile
You... can’t compete with shaun the sheep

la la la la la la la la la la la la
la la la la
la la la la

He’s always ready with a trick
to save the day
a good solution’s not a million miles away
within his flock
he’s pure gold
and if his mates get into trouble
he’ll return them to the ....

He’s Shaun the sheep
He’s Shaun the sheep
He even mucks about with those who cannot bleat
Keep it in mind
He’s one of a kind
Oh life’s a treat with Shaun the Sheep

He’s Shaun the sheep .. He’s Shaun the sheep
He’s Shaun the sheep .. He’s Shaun the sheep
He doesn’t miss a trick or ever lose a beat
Perhaps one day
You’ll find a way
To ... come and meet with Shaun the sheep
Oh.....
Come and bleat with shaun the sheep
