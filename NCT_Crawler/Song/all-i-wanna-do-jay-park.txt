[Hook]
Girl
(I need a cha cha beat boy)

Girl Pardon me I don't mean to be rude
But I got some paper I wanna spend on you
All I wanna do, is kick it with you
Bottles on deck for you and your crew
Baby swing by you should come through
All I wanna do, is kick it with you 

[Verse 1]
Girl look at you baby
Almost looking flyer than me
And I, I got that gold rollie
With the benzel and Louie Vuitton on my body
And I know that *** don't impress ya
So no bull*** girl nothin extra

Put yo panties to the side if it's alright
