                        (verse 1)
 My heart beats a little bit slower
 These nights are a little bit colder
 Now that you're gone
 My skies seem a little bit darker
 Sweet dreams come a little bit harder.....
 I hate when you're gone. Everyday time is passing
 growing tired of all this traffic
 Take me away to where you are.. (chorus)
 I wanna be holding your hand in the sand by
 the tire swings
 Where we used to be
 baby you and me I'd travel a thousand miles
 Just so I can see you smile
 Feels so far away when you cry
 Cause home is in your eyes (verse 2)
 Your heart beats a little bit faster
 There's tears where there used to be laughter...
 Now that I'm gone.... You talk just a little bit softer
 Things take just a little bit longer..
 You hate that I'm gone.. Everyday time is passing
 growing tired of all this travelling
 Take me away to where you are.. (chorus)
 I wanna be holding your hand in the sand by
 the tire swings
 Where we used to be
 baby you and me I'd travel a thousand miles
 Just so I can see you smile
 Feels so far away when you cry
 Cause home is in your eyes (bridge)
 If I could write another ending
 This wouldn't even be our song
 I'd find a way where we would never ever be apart
 Right from the start (chorus x2)
 I wanna be holding your hand in the sand by
 the tire swing
 Where we used to be
 baby you and me I'd travel a thousand miles
 Just so I can see you smile
 Feels so far away when you cry
 Cause home is in your eyes
                        
                    |
