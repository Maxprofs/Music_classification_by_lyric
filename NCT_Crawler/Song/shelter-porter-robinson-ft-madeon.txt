                        Bài hát : Shelter - Porter Robinson, Madeon

[Verse 1]
I could never find the right way to tell you
Have you noticed I've been gone?
Cause I left behind the home that you made me
But I will carry it along

[Chorus]
It's a long way forward, trust in me
I'll give them shelter like you've done for me
And I know, I'm not alone, you'll be watching over us
Until you're gone
[Verse 2]
When I'm older, I'll be silent beside you
I know words won't be enough
And they won't need to know the names on our faces
But they will carry on for us

[Chorus]
It's a long way forward, trust in me
I'll give them shelter like you've done for me
And I know, I'm not alone, you'll be watching over us
Until you're gone
It's a long way forward, trust in me
I'll give them shelter like you've done for me
And I know, I'm not alone, you'll be watching over us
Until you're gone
                        
                    |
