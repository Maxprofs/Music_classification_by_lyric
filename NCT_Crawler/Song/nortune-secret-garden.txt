                        Now, 
let the day just slip away so the dark night may watch over you 
Nocturne
Velvet blue, silent true, it embraces your heart and your soul 
Nocturne 

Never cry, never sigh, you don't have to wonder why 
Always be, always see, come and dream the night with me 
Nocturne 

Have no fear when the night draws near 
and fills you with dreams and desires 
Like a child asleep so warm so deep 
You will find me there waiting for you 
Nocturne 

Never cry, never sigh, you don't have to wonder why 
Always be, always see, come and dream the night with me 
Nocturne 

Now the darkness lay, it will give way 
When the dark night delivers the day
Nocturne
                        
                    |
