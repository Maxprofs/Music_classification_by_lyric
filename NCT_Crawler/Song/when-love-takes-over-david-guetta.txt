David Guetta (ft. Kelly Rowland) - When Love Takes Over

Promo Only for KEY Album!

Its complicated
It always is
That’s just the way it goes
Feels like the way it is so long for this
I wonder if it shows
And under water now I can breath
It never felt so good
'Cause I can feel it coming over me
I wouldn’t stop it if I could
When love takes over
Yeaaah
You know you can’t deny
When love takes over
Yeaaah
'Cause something’s here tonight

Give me a reason I gotta know
Do you feel it too?
Can't you see me here on overload
And this time I blame you
Hmm
Looking out for you to hold my hand
It feels like I could fall
Now love me right like I know you can
We could lose it all
When love takes over
Yeaaah
You know you can’t deny
When love takes over
Yeaaah
Cause something’s here tonight
Tonight tonight tonight tonight
Tonight tonight tonight tonight
Tonight tonight tonight tonight
Tonight tonight tonight tonight
I'll be loving all the time
It's true
'Cause I want to make it right with you

When love takes over
When love takes over
When love takes over
When love takes over
When love takes over
When love takes over
When love takes over
Over over over
Over over over
Over over over
When love takes over
Yeaaah
You know you can’t deny
When love takes over
Yeaaah
'Cause something’s here tonight
