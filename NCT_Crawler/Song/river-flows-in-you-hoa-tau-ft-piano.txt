                        Bài hát: River Flows In You - Hòa Tấu, Piano

If you have your way, it's in you. 

If you can bear it, 
Put everything into all your heart in there... 

Holding you, holding you 
It's in you 
River flows in you 

Slowly slowly 
River flows in you 

Waiting waiting 
After all, are you gonna be there with me? 

I want to fall for you so that i can always feel you 

If you can bear it, 
Put everything into all your heart in there..
