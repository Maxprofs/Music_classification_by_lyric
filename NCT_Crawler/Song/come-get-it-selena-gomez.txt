                        You ain’t gotta worry it’s an open invitation
I’ll be sittin’ right here real patient
All day all night I’ll be waitin’ standby
Can’t stop because I love it, hate the way I love you
All day all night maybe I’m addicted for life, no lie.

I’m not too shy to show I love you, I got no regrets.
I love you too much, much to hide you, this love ain’t finished yet.
This love ain’t finished yet...So baby whenever you’re ready...

[chorus]
When you ready come and get it (x3)
Na na na (x3)

You got the kind of love that I want, let me get that.
And baby once I get it I’m yours no take backs.
I’m gon’ love you for life I ain’t leaving your side
Even if you knock it ain’t no way to stop it (x2)
Forever you’re mine baby I’m addicted no lie

I’m not too show to show I love you, I got no regrets.
So baby whenever you’re ready.....

[chorus]
When you ready come and get it (x3)
Na na na (x3)

When you’re ready come and get it
This love will be the death of me, but I know I’ll die happily
I’ll know I’ll know I’ll know
Because you love me so...Yeah!

[chorus]
When you ready come and get it (x3)
Na na na (x3)

When you ready come and get it
                        
                    |
