                        Hey lady, you lady, cursing at your life 
You're a discontented mother and a regimented wife 
I've no doubt you dream about the things you'll never do 
But, I wish someone had talked to me 
Like I wanna talk to you..... 

Oh, I've been to Georgia and California and anywhere I could run 
I took the hand of a preacher man and we made love in the sun 
But I ran out of places and friendly faces because I had to be free 
I've been to paradise but I've never been to me 

Please lady, please lady, don't just walk away 
'Cause I have this need to tell you why I'm all alone today 
I can see so much of me still living in your eyes 
Won't you share a part of a weary heart that has lived million lies.... 

Oh, I've been to Niece and the Isle of Greece while I've sipped champagne on a yacht 
I've moved like Harlow in Monte Carlo and showed 'em what I've got 
I've been undressed by kings and I've seen some things that a woman ain't supposed to see 
I've been to paradise, but I've never been to me 

[spoken] 
Hey, you know what paradise is? 
It's a lie, a fantasy we create about people and places as we'd like them to be 
But you know what truth is? 
It's that little baby you're holding, it's that man you fought with this morning 
The same one you're going to make love with tonight 
That's truth, that's love...... 

Sometimes I've been to crying for unborn children that might have made me complete 
But I took the sweet life, I never knew I'd be bitter from the sweet 
I've spent my life exploring the subtle whoring that costs too much to be free 
Hey lady...... 
I've been to paradise, (I've been to paradise) 
But I've never been to me 

(I've been to Georgia and California, and anywhere I could run) 
I've been to paradise, never been to me 
(I've been to Neice and the isle of Greece while I've sipped champagne on a yacht) 
I've been to paradise, never been to me 
(I've been to cryin' for unborn children that might have made me complete) 
I've been to paradise, never been to me 
(I've been to Georgia and California, and anywhere I could run) 
I've been to paradise, never been to me
