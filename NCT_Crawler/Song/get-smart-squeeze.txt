                        Get lucky, get jumping but get smart
 Get walking, get loving but get smart
 Get ready, get cooking, get everybody looking
 But get smart Get evil, get nasty but get smart
 Get violent, get bitching but get smart
 Get ready, get going, it's talking time for showing
 But get smart You look at me like what to say
 You asking me or what are you playing?
 I said to you whatever I feel the way
 I feel in my heart, so get up and get smart Get jivey, get superb but get smart
 Get posing, get playing but get smart
 Get ready, get calling, get everybody going
 But get smart Get buried, get diddely but get smart
 Get hammered, get plastered but get smart
 Get ready, get dressed, get sucking all the rest
 But get smart You look at me like what to say
 You asking me or what are you playing?
 I said to you whatever I feel the way
 I feel in my heart, so get up and get smart Get up and get smart
 Get up and get smart
 Get up and get smart
 Get up and get smart
 Get up and get smart
