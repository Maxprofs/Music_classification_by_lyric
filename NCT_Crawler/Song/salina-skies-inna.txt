                        Bài hát: Salina Skies - Inna

[Verse 1] 
Took a car to Rio, crossed the border to Mexhico 
Ten hours right down to the sea 

And my heart was racing
Cause I know that you'll be waiting
Same time and place we always meet

[Pre-Chorus]
Outside, drinking the moonlight
You'll fill up all my, my fantasies
Outside, stars are in yours eyes
We're dancing all night, more memories

[Chorus 1]
One more time, under the Salina skies
As I hold you with these arms of mine
One more time, under the Salina skies

[Verse 2]
Never mind siesta, we just got our own fiesta
We're the only ones left on the beach
Coming like the ocean, let me drown in your emotions
I'm ready to learn if you will teach

[Pre-Chorus]
Outside, drinking the moonlight
You'll fill up all my, my fantasies
Outside, stars are in yours eyes
We're dancing all night, more memories

[Chorus 2]
One more time, under the Salina skies
As I hold you with these arms of mine
One more time, let's celebrate all of tonight
I can tell by the look in your eyes

[Bridge]
Never year-ear
We'll be right here-ere
We'll meet again-ain
No sacrifice
One more time, under the Salina skies

[Chorus 2]
One more time, under the Salina skies
As I hold you with these arms of mine
One more time, let's celebrate all of tonight
I can tell by the look in your eyes

[Bridge]
Never year-ear
We'll be right here-ere
We'll meet again-ain
No sacrifice
One more time, under the Salina skies
                        
                    |
