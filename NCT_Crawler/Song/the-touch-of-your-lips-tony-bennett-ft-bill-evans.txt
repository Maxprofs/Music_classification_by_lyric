                        The touch of your lips
 Upon my brow
 Your lips that are cool
 And sweet Such tenderness
 Lies in their soft caress
 My heart forgets to beat The touch of your hands
 Upon my head
 The love in your eyes
 A-shine And now, at last
 The moment divine
 The touch of your lips
 On mine The touch of your hands
 Upon my head
 The love in your eyes
 A-shine And now, at last
 The moment divine
 The touch of your lips
 That look in your eyes
 The touch of your lips
 On mine
                        
                    |
