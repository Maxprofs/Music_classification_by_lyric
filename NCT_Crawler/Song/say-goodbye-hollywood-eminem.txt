Say goodbye say goodbye to Hollywood
Say goodbye say goodbye to Hollywood
Say goodbye say goodbye to Hollywood
Say goodbye say goodbye to Hollywood
Say goodbye say goodbye to Hollywood
Say goodbye say goodbye to Hollywood
Say goodbye say goodbye to Hollywood
Say goodbye say goodbye to Hollywood
I thought I had it all figured out I did
I thought I was tough enough to stick it out with kim
But I wasn't tough enough to juggle two things at once
I found myself planted on my knees in cuffs
Which shoulda been a reason enough for me to get my stuff
and just leave
How come I couldn't just see this *** myself it's me
Nobody coulda seen this *** I felt
Knowin' damn well she wasn't gonna be there when I fell
To catch me the minute she was seen she just bailed
I'm standin' and swingin' on like 30 people by myself
I couldn't even see the millimeter when it fell
Turned around saw Gary stashin' a heater in his belt
Saw the bouncers rush him and beat him to the ground
I just sold 2 million records I don't need to go to jail
I'm not about to lose my freedom over no female
I need to slow down, trynna get my feet on solid ground
So for now
Bury my face in comic books, 'cuz I don't wanna look
And nothin' in this world is too much
I swallowed all I could
If I could swallow a bottle of Tylenol I would
And hit it for good and say goodbye to Hollywood
I prolly should 'cuz these problems are piled all at once
'Cuz everything that bothers me I got all bottled up
I think I'm bottomin' out but I'm not about to give up
I gotta get up, thank God I got a little girl
Now I'm a responsible father so not alotta good
I'd be to my daughter layin' in the bottom of the mud
Must be in my blood 'cuz I don't know how to do it
All I know is I don't wanna follow in the footsteps
Of my dad 'cuz I hate him so bad
Worst feelin' I had was growin' up to be like his fuckin' ass
Man if you could understand why I am the way that I am
What do I say to my fans when I tell 'em
I don't wanna quit, but ***,
I feel like this is it, for me to have this much appeal
like this is sick
This is not a game this fame the real life is as sick
Publicity stunt my ass, consume my fuckin' dick
*** the guns, I'm done I'll never look at gats
If I scrap, I'ma scrap it like I never wooped some ass
I love my fans but no one ever puts a grasp on the fact
That I sacrificed everything I had
I never dreamt I'd get to the level that I'm at
This is wack, this is more then I ever coulda asked
Everywhere I go I had a sweater, hood or mask
What about math? how come I wasn't never good at that
It's like the boy in a bubble who never could adapt I'm
If I could go back, I never woulda rapped
I sold my soul to the devil, ill never get it back
I just wanna leave this game with level head intact
Imagine goin' from bein' no one and seein' everything blow
And all you did was grow up Emceein'
It's fuckin' crazy, all I wanted was to give Hailie the life
I never had
I've forced us to live alienated, so i'm sayin'
Goodbye
Goodbye Hollywood
Please don't cry for me
When I'm gone for good
So, goodbye
Goodbye Hollywood
Please don't cry for me
When I'm gone for good
