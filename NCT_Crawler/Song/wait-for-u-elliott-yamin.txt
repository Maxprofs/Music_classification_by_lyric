                        I never felt nothing in the world like this before,
now im missing you, and i'm wishing you would come back through my door
why did you have to go, you could have let me know
so now i'm alone
girl you could've stayed but you wouldnt give me a chance
with you not around theres a little bit more than i can stand
and all my tears are stained keep running down my face
why did you turn away?
so why did your pride
make u run and hide
are u that afraid of me
but i know its a lot what u keep inside
this is not how you want it to be
so baby i will wait for you
cause i dont know what else i can do
dont tell me i ran out of time
if it takes the rest of my life
baby i will wait for you
if you think im fine it just aint true
i really need you in my life
no matter what i have to do i'll wait for you
been a long time since u called me
did you forget about me
you gotta be feeling crazy
how can you walk away
everything stays the same
i just cant do it baby
what will it take to make you come back
girl i told you what it is and it just aint like that
no why cant you look at me
youre still in love with me
dont leave me crying
baby why cant we just start over again
get it back to the way it was
if you give me a chance
i can love you right
but youre telling me it wont be enough
so baby i will wait for you
cause i dont know what else i can do
dont tell me i ran out of time
if it takes the rest of my life
baby i will wait for you
if you think im fine it just aint true
i really need you in my life
no matter what i have to do i'll wait for you
so why did your pride
make u run and hide
are u that afraid of me
but i know its a lot what u keep inside
this is not how you want it to be
baby i will wait for you
baby i will wait for you
if its the last thing i do
so baby i will wait for you
cause i dont know what else i can do
dont tell me i ran out of time
if it takes the rest of my life
baby i will wait for you
if you think im fine it just aint true
i really need you in my life
no matter what i have to do i'll wait for you
