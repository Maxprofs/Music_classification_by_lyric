                        Bài hát: Bittersweet - Apocalyptica

I'm giving up the ghost of love
In the shadows cast on devotion.

She's the one that I adore
Creed of my silent suffocation.

Break this bittersweet spell on me,
Lost in the arms of destiny.

Bittersweet.

I won't give up; I'm possessed by her.
I'm bearing the cross; she's turned into my curse.

Break this bittersweet spell on me,
Lost in the arms of destiny,
Bittersweet, I want you (I'm only wanting you)
Bittersweet lyrics on ***
And I need you (i'm only needing you)

Break this bittersweet spell on me,
Lost in the arms of destiny.
Break this bittersweet spell on me,
Lost in the arms of destiny.
