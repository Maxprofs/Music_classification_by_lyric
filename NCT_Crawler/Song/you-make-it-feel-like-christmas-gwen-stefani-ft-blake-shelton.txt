                        Song: You Make It Feel Like Christmas - Gwen Stefani, Blake Shelton

I want to thank the storm that brought the snow
Thanks to the string of lights that make it glow
But I wanna thank you, baby
You make it feel like Christmas

[Gwen Stefani:]
It barely took a breath to realize
We're gonna be a classic for all time
I wanna thank you, baby
You make it feel like Christmas

[Together:]
Sweet gingerbread made with molasses
My heart skipped and I reacted
Can't believe that this is happening
Like a present sent from God
Sleigh bells singing hallelujah
Stars are shining on us, too

I wanna thank you, baby
You make it feel like Christmas

[Blake Shelton:]
Thought I was done for, thought that love had died
But you came along; I swear you saved my life
And I wanna thank you, baby
You make it feel like Christmas

[Together:]
Sweet gingerbread made with molasses
My heart skipped and I reacted
Can't believe that this is happening
Like a present sent from God
Sleigh bells singing hallelujah
Stars are shining on us, too

I wanna thank you, baby
You make it feel like Christmas

[Gwen Stefani:]
I never thought I'd find a love like this
But I found forever in that very first kiss
I wanna thank you, baby
You make it feel like Christmas
Oh-oh
([Blake Shelton:] Thank you baby)

[Together:]
I wanna thank you, baby
You make it feel like Christmas
                        
                    |
