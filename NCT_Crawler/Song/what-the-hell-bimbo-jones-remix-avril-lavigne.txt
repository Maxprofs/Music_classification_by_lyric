                        Bài hát: What The Hell - Avril Lavigne

You say that I'm messing with your head (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah) 
All 'cause I was making out with your friends (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah) 
Love hurts whether it's right or wrong (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah) 
I can't stop 'cause I'm having too much fun (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah) 

You're on your knees 
Begging please 
Stay with me 
But honestly 
I just need to be a little crazy 

All my life I've been good but now, woah, I'm thinking what the hell 
All I want is to mess around and I don't really care about 
If you love me, if you hate me, you can't save me, baby, baby 
All my life I've been good but now, whoa, what the hell 

What... what... what... What the hell? 

So what if I go out on a million dates (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah) 
You never call or listen to me anyway (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah) 
I rather rage than sit around and wait all day (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah) 
Don't get me wrong. I just need some time to play-ay (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah) 

You're on your knees 
Begging please 
Stay with me 
But honestly 
I just need to be a little crazy

All my life I've been good but now, I'm thinking what the hell 
All I want is to mess around and I don't really care about 
If you love me, if you hate me 
You can't save me, baby, baby 
All my life I've been good but now, whoa, what the hell 

La la la la la la la la... Woah... Woah... 
La la la la la la la la... Woah... Woah... 

You say that I'm messing with your head 
Boy, I like messing in your bed 
Yeah, I am messing with your head 
When I'm messing with you in bed 

All my life I've been good but now, I'm thinking what the hell (what the hell) 
All I want is to mess around and I don't really care about (I don't care about) 
All my life I've been good but now, I'm thinking what the hell 
All I want is to mess around and I don't really care about. (if you love me) 
If you love me (no), if you hate me (no) 
You can't save me, baby, baby (if you love me) 
All my life I've been good but now, whoa, what the hell 

La la, La la la la la la, La la, La la la la la la la
