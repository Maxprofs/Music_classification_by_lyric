                        Bài hát: Love Is Only Just A Dream (Tình Nhạt Phai) - Tokyo Square

Life's not a dream
when emptiness has spilled the scene
when you walked away from me and told me
love is only just a dream
I have tried to say good bye
but worlds have gotten in the way
Couldn't hold my feeling
I just broke down and cry

Breaking up is not a game
Oh my baby can't you see me
I still love you baby
I just can't let you go
Couldn't live without you baby
I'll rather run my life this way
When you turn and walk way
I knew that love is only just a dream
                        
                    |
