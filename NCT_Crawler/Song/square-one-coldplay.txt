Square One

You're in control is there anywhere you wanna go?
You're in control is there anything you wanna know?
The future's for discovering
The space in which we're travelling

From the top of the first page
To the end of the last page
From the start in your own way
You just want somebody listening to what you say
It doesn't matter who you are.

Under the surface trying to break through
Deciphering the coins in you
I need a coin thats virtually in black
I'm on the top I can't get back
Whoah. Woah.

From the first line of the first page
To the end of the last page
You were looking
From the start in your own way
You just want somebody listening to what you say
It doesn't matter who you are
It doesn't matter who you are

Oooh.
You just want somebody listening to what you say
You just want somebody listening to what you say
It doesn't matter who you are
It doesn't matter who you are

Is there anybody out there who is lost and hurt and lonely too
Bleeding all your colours into one
And if you come undone as if you'd been run through
Some catapult it fired you
You wonder if your chance will ever come
And if you're stuck in square one.
