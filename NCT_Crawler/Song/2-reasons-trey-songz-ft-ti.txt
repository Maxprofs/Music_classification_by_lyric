All I do is turn up ain't no knowing don't concern us
All this bubble kush I burn up spend some regular with one us
Turning corner fishtailing out the parking lot, yelling BankHead, Westside, need a 9 chicks trailing
Right behind us been this way since we was minors, if it wasn't for the chicks up in this bitch you wouldn't find us
Either way I try the same thang, wanna came through the door, like here you go came for (Came For)
