                        Christmas days and Valentines,
happy days when you were mine
Baby, Easter morning, summer nights,
how I miss you by my side

Many lonely nights I cried.
Wondering boy, why oh why?
Even though I can't deny our love, love you so

I'm divided in two. Please tell me what should I do?
A part of me says no no no no, and another runs to you
So divided in two. Please tell me what should I do?
'Cause you're driving me crazy, I'm so in love with you

Every evening, every hour,
every day where are you now?
Baby, every time I close my eyes,
see your face and then I cry
Now I feel I can't describe,
how I miss you here tonight
Though you make me feel like I'm alright, be by my side

I'm divided in two. Please tell me what should I do?
A part of me says no no no no, and another runs to you
So divided in two. Please tell me what should I do?
'Cause you're driving me crazy, I'm so in love with you

Um...I'm not here right now, so leave a message, bye

Baby, please pick up the phone, I know you're there.
Anyway, I just want to tell you that I'm sorry,
I love you, and I miss you

I'm divided in two. Please tell me what should I do?
A part of me says no no no no, and another runs to you
So divided in two. Please tell me what should I do?
'Cause you're driving me crazy, I'm so in love with you
Oh boy you're driving me crazy, I'm so in love with you
