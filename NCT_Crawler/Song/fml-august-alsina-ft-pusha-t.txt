                        Bài hát : FML - August Alsina, Pusha T

[Verse 1: Pusha T]
Wake up feeling like *** my life
Life's a bitch she better *** me right
Lost my love in this loosing game
When the feds came, its like i lost my wife
Nigga loosing weight, as i'm loosing time
See i took a lose, see i lost a mill then i lost my mind
Over compensating with them hoes, over compensating with them hoes
Over did it like its over time
Told her run the tab till she overdose
Al ? al ? , king push like king tut
Made niggas to your middle men
Middle fingers, we don't give a ***
Push

[Verse 2: August Alsina]

Let me tell you bout my self, i'm not scared to die
Been through so much ***, sometimes i wanna be in the sky
Wanna know how it feels to fly, wanna know how it feels to fly
Scared of hello, ain't scared of goodbye

[Hook]
I never thought i would be here, i never thought i would get this far
If they say life's like a picture , why am i sitting in the dark

Sometimes i just feel like, *** my life
*** my life
Even when im up im feeling down
*** my life
Got niggas locked up ??
*** my life, *** my life
Sometimes i just feel like, *** my life
*** my life, *** my life


[Verse 3:August Alsina]

See i grew up in the jungle, where everybody broke
A lot of niggas never make it, all they know is selling dope
Life ain't easy, ??
Might not make it here tomorrow, like i'm running outta hope


[Hook]
I never thought i would be here, i never thought i would get this far
If they say life's like a picture , why am i sitting in the dark

Sometimes i just feel like, *** my life
*** my life
Even when im up im feeling down
*** my life
Got niggas locked up ??
*** my life, *** my life
Sometimes i just feel like, *** my life
*** my life, *** my life
