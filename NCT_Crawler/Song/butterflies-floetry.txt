                        Butterflies inside you give me butterflies inside X3
 Verse 1:
 All you gotta do is just walk away and pass me by
 Don't agnologe my smile yea when I try to say hello to you
 And all you gotta do is not answer my calls when I'm tryna get through
 To keep me wondering why and all I can do is sigh I just wanna ohh...
 Chorus
 I just want to touch and kiss
 And I wish that I could be with you tonight
 You give me butterflies inside
 Inside and I....
 Verse 2
 All I gotta say is I must be dreaming
 Can't be real
 Your not here with me
 I can feel you near to me
 So I carress you let you taste us
 Just so blissful listen I would give anything make my dream come true baby you give me butterflies
 Chorus X2
 Bridge:
 If you will take my hand babyi will show you guide you to the light babe
 If you will be my love baby I will love you
 Love you till the end of time
 Chorus X3
