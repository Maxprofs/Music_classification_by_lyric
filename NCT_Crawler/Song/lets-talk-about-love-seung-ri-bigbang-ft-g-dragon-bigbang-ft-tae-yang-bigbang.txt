You’re surprised by this, why? I have a strong aura
You still wait, why? You fall for me at once, why?
You’re a Venus tonight, your scent is like coconuts
What’s the use of saving it? I want you

It’s the only night, let’s dance tonight
I’m small but my words are strong

(Listen) When I open my eyes in the morning and she’s alone
You can stay by my side if you want
Lonely, lonely, I’m getting lonely
If you’re with me, this night will be great

Pretty girls are next to me and in front and back
You’re my Mona Lisa, I’m your Da Vinci
Don’t be scared, I won’t hurt you, I know you want me
I’ll be your guide on this lonely night so call me
Now you’re my master, and I’m your G-nie
Now tell me your wish

It’s the only night, let’s dance tonight

Past the stage of ecstasy, we’re trembling
From your head to your toes, I won’t miss a single part
Scream louder, I want to fly
You want to climax? I be ya thriller
Let’s talk about me? Let’s talk about you
Let’s talk about love? Let’s talk about X

Lonely, lonely, I’m getting lonely
If you’re with me, this night will be great

The sun is brightly shining and your eyes are blind to me
Tell me baby that you love me baby
I shine in the darkness and I’ll steal your body
Sorry baby I ain’t sorry biatch

What more needs to be said, it’s me honey
The more you eat me, the thirstier you get, you’ll be looking for me
Girl, T.a.e.y.a.n.g, scream my name tonight
Move your body
