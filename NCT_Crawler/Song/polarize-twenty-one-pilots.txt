                        Bài hát: Polarize - Twenty One Pilots

Help me polarize, help me polarize,
Help me down,
Those stairs is where I'll be hiding all my problems,
Help me polarize, help me polarize,
Help me out,
My friends and I, we've got a lot of problems.

You know where I'm coming,
From though I am running,
To you, all I feel is deny, deny, denial,
I wanted to be a better brother, better son,
Wanted to be a better adversary to the evil I have done,
I have none to show to the one I love,
But deny, deny, denial.

Help me polarize, help me polarize,
Help me down,
Those stairs is where I'll be hiding all my problems,
Help me polarize, help me polarize,
Help me out,
My friends and I, we've got a lot of problems.

Polarize is taking your disguises,
Separating them, splitting them up from wrong and right,
It's deciding where to die and deciding where to fight,
Deny, deny, denial.

I wanted to be a better brother, better son,
Wanted to be a better adversary to the evil I have done,
I have none to show to the one I love,
But deny, deny, denial.

Help me polarize, help me polarize,
Help me down,
Those stairs is where I'll be hiding all my problems,
Help me polarize, help me polarize,
Help me out,
My friends and I, we've got a lot of problems.

We've problems
We've problems

[2x]
Domingo en fuego, I think I lost my halo,
I don't know where you are,
You'll have to come and find me, find me.

We've problems
We've problems

Help me polarize, help me polarize,
Help me out,
My friends and I have problems.

Help me polarize, help me polarize,
Help me out,
My friends and I have problems.

Help me polarize, help me polarize,
Help me out,
My friends and I have problems.

Help me polarize, help me polarize,
Help me out,
My friends and I have problems.

We've problems
We've problems

I wanted to be a better brother, better son
I wanted to be a better brother, better son
I wanted to be a better brother, better son
