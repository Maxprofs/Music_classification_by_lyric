Bài Hát: Like You'll Never See Me Again
Trình Bày: Alicia Keys
If I had no more time
...
No more time 
left to be here
...
Would you cherish 
what we have
Cause I'm everything that 
...
you were looking for
...
If I couldn't feel your touch
...
And no longer 
were you with me
...
I'll be wishing you were here
To be everything that 
I've been looking for
...
I don't want to forget the present is a gift
...
And I don't want to take for granted
the time you may
 have here with me
...
Cause Lord only knows 
another day 
is not 
really guaranteed,
...
 so Everytime you
 hold me
...
Hold me like this is the
 last time
...
Everytime you
 kiss me
...
Kiss me like you'll 
never see me again
...
Everytime you 
touch
...
 me
Touch me like this is the
 last time
...
Promise that you'll
 love me
...
Love me like you'll
 never see me again
...
How many really know what love is
...
Now you never will
...
Do you know until you lose it
That it's everything that 
we are looking for
...
When I wake up in the morning
...
With you beside me
...
I'm so thankful that I found
...
Everything that 
I've been looking for
...
I don't want to forget the present is a gift
...
And I don't want to take for granted
the time you may have here with me
...
Cause Lord only knows another day
is not
 really guaranteed,
...
 so Everytime you hold me
...
Hold me like this is the 
last time
...
Everytime you
 kiss me
...
Kiss me like you'll 
never see me again
...
Everytime you 
touch me
...
Touch me like this is the 
last time
...
Promise that you'll
 love me
...
Love me like you'll 
never see me again
...
