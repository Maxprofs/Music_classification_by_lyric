                        Bài hát: A.M. - One Direction

Won’t you stay till the AM?
All my favourite conversations,
Always made in the AM, yeah

Feels like this could be forever tonight,
Prayed that these clocks forget about time,
There could be world war three,
Coming on outside,
You and me were raised in the same part of town,
Got these scars on the same ground
Remember how we used to kick around
Just wasting time?

Won’t you stay till the AM?
All my favourite conversations
Always made in the AM, yeah
‘Cause we don’t know what we’re saying
We’re just swimming around in our glasses
And talking out of our asses
Like we’re all gonna make it, yeah yeah

Feels like this could be forever right now,
Don’t wanna sleep 'cause we’re dreaming out loud,
Trying to behave but you know we never learned how,

You and me were raised in the same part of town,
Got these scars on the same ground,
Remember how we used to kick around,
Just wasting time?

Won’t you stay till the AM?
All my favourite conversations,
Always made in the AM, yeah
'Cause we don’t know what we’re saying,
We’re just swimming in our glasses,
And talking out of our asses,
Like we’re all gonna make it, yeah yeah

You know
I’m always going back to this place,
You know, and I said,
You know I’m always going to look for your face,
You know

Won’t you stay till the AM?
All my favourite conversations,
Always made in the AM

'Cause we don’t know what we’re saying,
We’re just swimming around in our glasses,
And talking out of our asses,
Like we’re all gonna make it, yeah yeah

Won’t you stay till the AM?
You know,
I’m always going back to this place,

Won’t you stay till the AM?
Yeah, yeah

You know I’m always going to look for your face,

Won’t you stay till the AM?
Yeah, yeah
