                        I don't like to sleep alone 
Stay with me 
Don't roam 
Talk with me for just a while 
So much of you to get to know 
Reaching out touching you 
Leaving all the worries far behind 
Loving you the way I do 
My mouth on yours and yours on mine 

Marry me 
Let me live with you 
Nothing's wrong and love is right 
Like a man said in his song 
Help me make it through the night 
Loneliness can get you down 
When you get to thinking no one cares 
Lean on me 
And I'll lean on you 
Together we will see it through 

No, I don't like to sleep alone 
It's sad to think some folks do 
No I don't like to sleep alone 
No one does 
Do you? 

I don't like to sleep alone 
No one does 
Do you?
                        
                    |
