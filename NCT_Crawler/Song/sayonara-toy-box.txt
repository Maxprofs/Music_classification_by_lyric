                        Sayonara baby

I hope it's not the end
Until we meet again

After each night there is a day
We'll be back,
though we go away
Smiling faces are everywhere
If you need us we'll be there

So be the sweetest song
just to let you know
that it is hard to let you go
until we're back together
you can be sure
that you'll be hearing more

Sayonara baby
This could be the end
(I hope it is not the end)
But I'm not worried baby
Cause we will meet again ...
(until we meet again!)

Sayonara baby
This could be the end
(I hope it is not the end)
But I'm not worried baby
Cause we will meet again ...
(until we meet again!)

(Sayonara my friend)
(I hope it is not the end)
(Sayonara)
(Until we meet again)

When the music is playing loud
You'll be hearing us crying out
Follow your dreams it's not too late
And just be yourself, don't hesitate ...

So be the sweetest song just to let you know
that it is hard to let you go
until we're back together
you can be sure
that you'll be hearing more

Sayonara baby
This could be the end
(I hope it is not the end)
But I'm not worried baby
Cause we will meet again ...
(until we meet again!)

Sayonara baby
This could be the end
(I hope it is not the end)
But I'm not worried baby
Cause we will meet again ...
(until we meet again!)

(I hope it is not the end.)

So for now,
until we see you again,
Sayonara

(until we meet again)
