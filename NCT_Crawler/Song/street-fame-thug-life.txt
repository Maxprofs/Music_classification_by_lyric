                        Turn it up in my head phones
 Comin' to a ghetto near you, Street fame, more
 Haha, comin' to a ghetto near you I wasn't mad until these tricks shot me
 It's time to sanitize my posse look how paranoid these niggaz got me
 Cellular calls are being traced since surveillance silently
 Momma chill, thug livin' pay the bills and die violently Closed caskets, expose bastards I leave 'em bloody
 Deloris Tucker don't let your kids hear a nigga speak
 On gettin' money ain't nothin' funny, green, got a nigga seein' things
 Why, hit the lye hope to God I can fly Lethal weapon I'ma savage, still a method to my madness
 Blast niggaz laugh call 'em care cabbage
 Read 'em and weep, put 'em to sleep they hell bound
 Lyrics will leave 'em spell bound, clown now tired of bein' held down Cross my heart hope to die, blinded in some pussy millionaire
 Livin' care free, sucka free, playa haters miss me
 Hope in hard times never catch me slippin'
 *** authorities they wonder why minorities be trippin' We ain't havin' it
 Time to tear this *** back, ghetto children kick back
 Once I hit the mat, niggaz will never get this *** back
 Spit it so eloquently, my pistols represent me
 Bust until my rounds empty, back for the street fame One love to my true thugs
 Comin' to a ghetto near you, Street fame, bust
 Comin' to a ghetto near you, Street fame
 All out warfare, eye for a eye
 Bustin' on my enemies bad boy killin', straight dissin' you
 *** Lil' Kim you Nasty Bitch Temperatures rises, niggaz blinded by my lyrical disguise
 No time to plot retreats, niggaz shiver and die
 Multiple rounds found laced in his body and face
 Wrapped in plastic the acid, erased all traces Criminal tactics the rap game became so drastic
 Military mind mashed all the walls they blasted
 If we bleed then they suffocate, chokin' in terror
 So we strive singularize we reflect in the mirrors The prophecy is clear niggaz lock 'n load disappear
 Strategize with no fear, wagin' war for years
 The crack game wasn't big enough, ready to rush
 Bitch made mother***ers get murdered and touched I go to jail niggaz screamin', 'Free me', speakin' freely
 Conversation with my comrades kickin' Swahili
 Indeed nature feel my first seed, it gets worse
 Plans are cursed to be a G on the first to breathe Currency in stacks artillery in the back
 Strapped armies, we camouflaged in all black
 When we attack, holla out my set
 Nigga tighten your jaw, givin' birth to outlawz
 Ha, ha, Street fame Bust, nigga, bust
 Comin' to a ghetto near you, hell, yeah, it's true
 Street fame
 Only Makaveli the Don can put it down like this, hey Nas
 Comin' to a ghetto near you with Street fame Positive identification got me rushed to the station
 Stuck in this line up tryin' hard to hide my face
 They placed the name but can't recall description
 I ain't did *** officer that bitch trippin' Promise retaliation they plan busted, no man to be trusted
 Everything corrupted once man touched it
 Kamikaze, hopin' that none of the spies find me
 That's why we bye, bye daily knowin' cops trail me, but why cry? Floatin' while we tokin' on this potent branch
 Flossin' in the thug stance, flippin' pockets out inside my pants
 Never underestimate me, playa hate me, see me and hide
 Sure as hollow points shatter, enemies die Spread love dead thugs, gettin' buried in riches
 Take a chance to advance *** them worrin' bitches
 Penitentiary's a possibility, bust and pray
 Wear a rubber so I live to *** another day, hey
 Ain't nothin' strange, I'm 25 dyin' to change
 But still I bang wantin' street fame, that's the end of that Thugged out, Makaveli the Don
 Representin' the Outlawz, Street fame
 One love to my true niggaz
 Comin' to a ghetto near you, Street fame Makaveli the Don, Killuminati
 Comin' to a ghetto near you, Street fame
 Yo, check this out, I'ma tell you like this
 Street Fame If the lifestyle that you livin'
 Got you takin' more ***in' shorts than gettin' props
 Then that lifestyle need to stop, best to recognize some Outlaw ***
 'Cuz only in this Outlaw lifestyle can you truly come to
 To see what this life's supposed to be like
 Nigga you'll start to see riches, fine bitches and hittin' switches
 ***, to me that ***
 To me that *** sound delicious
