[Intro:]
 Oooooooo [4x]
 Yeah, T-Pain, Bow Weezy
 T-Pain sing to em

[Chorus:]
 Ohhh, 
 Baby, they can all say what they want cause you make it do what it do (Do what it do [3x])
 But you just keep living ya life and they keep wasting time hating on you (Hating on you [2x])
 They be hating on you, hating on you, hating on you
 And they get mad when you win cause that's when they lose, that's when they lose, that's when they lose
 And you got better *** to do with your time 

[Verse 1:]
 They hating on ya, because they know you bad
 Must be doing something right, if you got these bitches mad
 She never met her pops he left when she was five
 Now she 19 stripping enough just to pay the bills
 A single parent mom know it gotta be hard
 Plus her baby daddy never seen the kid
 She searching for love and she say that it’s tough
 Because she dances it’s hard to find a man
 And between all that she still in school
 Using college as a back up plan
 And like Pac said, keep ya head up
 I know it’s hard at times, you get fed up
 But don’t let up, gotta stay strong
 But whatever you do just don’t give up
 Don’t worry bout em, just do you
 Stay focused, get on your grind
 Just know that you can call on me
 Whenever them niggas get out of line
 And see a good friend is so hard to find
 Somebody who down to ride
 The best is yet to come for you
 Don’t let nobody steal your pride

[Chorus:]
 Ohhh, 
 Baby, they can all say what they want cause you make it do what it do (Do what it do [3x])
 But you just keep living ya life and they keep wasting time hating on you (Hating on you [2x])
 They be hating on you, hating on you, hating on you
 And they get mad when you win cause that's when they lose, that's when they lose, that's when they lose (That's when they lose baby, yeah)
 And you got better *** to do with your time

[Verse 2:]
 You done came up, that’s why everybody done changed up
 You would think you worked at Gold’s gym
 The way you done stepped your weight up
 Got a new man and got a new life
 She bout to become a new wife
 Looking like a new woman
 Feels like you been blessed twice
 Done stopped dancing and graduated
 All it took was a little patience
 Never mind how you got here
 Just know that you finally made it
 I’m just living in it but it's your world
 You deserve it, you worked hard, you ballin’ now
 Got a new car, no car note, cause it’s paid off (Damn)
 I’m proud of ya, (proud of ya) you came a long way (Yeah)
 And if you need some inspiration
 Just let this song play
 Because a good friend is so hard to find
 Somebody who down to ride
 The best is yet, to come for you
 Don’t let nobody steal your pride

[Chorus:]
 Ohhh, 
 Baby, they can all say what they want cause you make it do what it do (Do what it do [3x])
 But you just keep living ya life and they keep wasting time hating on you (Hating on you [2x])
 They be hating on you, hating on you, hating on you
 And they get mad when you win cause that's when they lose, that's when they lose, that's when they lose 
 And you got better *** to do with your time

[Hook:]
 Aye, let em, let em, let em hate
 That’s why they hating girl, you winning so don’t pay em no attention
 Let em, let em, let em hate
 Jealous of ya cause they can’t be in your position
 Let em, let em, let em hate
 That’s why they hating girl, you winning so don’t pay em no attention
 Let em, let em, let em, let em hate
 jealous of ya cause they can’t be in your position

[Chorus:]
