                        Chest to chest
 Nose to nose
 Palm to palm
 We were always just that close
 Wrist to wrist
 Toe to toe
 Lips that felt just like the inside of a rose

 [Bridge:]
 So how come when I reach out my finger
 It feels like more than distance between us

 [Chorus:]
 In this California king bed
 Were 10000 miles apart
 I been California wishing on the stars
 For your heart on me
 My California king

 Eye to eye
 Cheek to cheek
 Side by side
 You were sleeping next to me
 Arm in arm
 Dusk to dawn
 With the curtains drawn
 And a little last night on these sheets

 (Repeat Bridge + Chorus)

 Just when I felt like giving up on us
 You turned around and gave me one last touch
 That made everything feel better
 And even then my eyes got wetter
 So confused when I asked ask you if you love me
 But I don't wanna seem so weak
 Maybe I've been California dreaming

 (Repeat Chorus x2)
                        
                    |
