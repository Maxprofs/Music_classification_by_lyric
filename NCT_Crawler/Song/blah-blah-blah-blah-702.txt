                        Hey girl, hey, where you been? Ya phone still on?
 I been tryin' to reach you, my mans them said they saw you
 And I was like, man, I got to call her, man, I got to get at her, man
 It's funny that I see you now, girl, you so fine, look at you
 Went some, blah, blah, blah, blah There you go again, talkin' about where have I been
 Like I'm your child, it is none of your biz
 Shut your mouth, I'm tired of hearing you running your trap
 By the way, I forgot to say that your bags are packed Why you wanna bother me?
 Constantly pagin' me, drivin' me crazy
 Talkin' that yadi ya
 All up in my ear goin' Blah, blah, blah, blah
 Silence I ain't hearin' no more 'cause all I hear is
 Blah, blah, blah, blah
 Every time you open your mouth all I hear is
 Blah, blah, blah, blah Always tryin' to put me in check, spittin' to me that
 Blah, blah, blah, blah
 Sorry boy, you played yourself, you sure keep sayin'
 Blah, blah, blah, blah See that house you in, it's your mamas crib
 You ain't got your own
 Flossin' fakin' bling, Jay Z wanna be
 Claimin' money ain't a thang You ain't gotta lie to kick it
 You ain't got *** just admit it
 See I'm rollin' high but your passin' by
 On the passenger side Why you wanna bother me?
 Constantly pagin' me, drivin' me crazy
 Talkin' that yadi ya
 All up in my ear goin' Blah, blah, blah, blah
 Silence I ain't hearin' no more 'cause all I hear is
 Blah, blah, blah, blah
 Every time you open your mouth all I hear is
 Blah, blah, blah, blah Always tryin' to put me in check, spittin' to me that
 Blah, blah, blah, blah
 Sorry boy, you played yourself, you sure keep sayin' You wonder why I don't call you
 Baby, you're not man enough for me, no, no
 'Cause every time you call my phone you just go on and on
 Talkin' all that nonsense, I can't take no more Blah, blah, blah, blah
 Silence I ain't hearin' no more 'cause all I hear is
 Blah, blah, blah, blah
 Every time you open your mouth all I hear is
 Blah, blah, blah, blah Always tryin' to put me in check, spittin' to me that
 Blah, blah, blah, blah
 Sorry boy, you played yourself, you sure keep sayin'
 Blah, blah, blah, blah Silence I ain't hearin' no more 'cause all I hear is
 Blah, blah, blah, blah
 Every time you open your mouth all I hear is
 Blah, blah, blah, blah Always tryin' to put me in check, spittin' to me that
 Blah, blah, blah, blah
 Sorry boy, you played yourself, you sure keep sayin'
 Blah, blah, blah, blah
