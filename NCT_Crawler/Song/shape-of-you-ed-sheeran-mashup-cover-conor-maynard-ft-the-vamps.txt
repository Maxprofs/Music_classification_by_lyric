[(No Scrubs by TLC) Conor:]
No, I don't want no scrub
A scrub is a girl that can't get no love from me
Hanging out the passenger side
Of her best friend's ride
Trying to holler at me

[(Baby Boy by Beyoncé) Brad:]
Baby girl you stay on my mind
Fulfill my fantasy
Tell me how you feel
I think about you all the time
I see it in my dreams

[(Cheap Thrills by Sia) Conor:]
Baby I don't need dollar bills to have fun tonight
(I love cheap thrills!)
Baby I don't need dollar bills to have fun tonight
(I love cheap thrills!)

[(Rockabye by Clean Bandit) Brad:]
So rockabye baby, rockabye
I'm gonna rock you
Rockabye baby, don't you cry
No

[(Temperature by Sean Paul) Conor:]
Well woman the way the time cold I wanna be keepin' you warm
I got the right temperature to shelter you from the storm

[(Mercy by Shawn Mendes) Brad:]
So please have mercy on me
Take it easy on my heart

[(Controlla by Drake) Conor:]
Like controlla, controlla

[(Lean On by DJ Snake ft. MØ) Brad:]
'Cause all we need it somebody to lean on

[(Angel by Shaggy) Conor:]
Girl you're my angel, you're my darling angel

[(It Wasn't Me by Shaggy) Brad:]
She caught me on the counter (It wasn't me!)
Saw me banging on the sofa

[(All Night by The Vamps ft. Matoma) Conor:]
'Cause I've been up all night, no sleep
'Cause I feel like I'm always dreaming

[(Are You Sure? by Conor Maynard ft. KKA) Brad:]
Who do you love?
And are you sure?

[(Locked Out Of Heaven by Bruno Mars) Conor:]
'Cause you make me feel like
I've been locked out of heaven

[(Chasing Cars by Snow Patrol) Brad:]
If I lay here
If I just lay here
Would you lie with me
And just forget the world?

[(Wake Me Up Before You Go-go by Wham!) Conor:]
So wake me up, before you go-go
Don't leave me hanging on like a yo-yo

[(Mr Brightside by The Killers) Brad:]
Jealousy, turning saints into the sea
But it's just the price I pay
Destiny is calling me

[(Shape Of You by Ed Sheeran) Both:]
I'm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is falling too
I'm in love with your body
And last night you were in my room
And now my bedsheets smell like you
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with the shape of you
                        
                    |
