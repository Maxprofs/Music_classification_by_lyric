Closer [x4]

[Verse 1]
Turn the lights off in this place
And she shines just like a star
And I swear I know her face
I just don't know who you are
Turn the music up in here
I still hear her loud and clear
Like she's right there in my ear
Telling me that she wants to own me
To control me
Come closer [x3]

[Chorus]
And I just can't pull my self away
Under her spell I can't break
I just can't stop [x4]
And i just can't bring myself no way
But I don't want to escape
I just can't stop [x4]

[Verse 2]
I can feel her on my skin
I can taste her on my tongue
She's the sweetest taste of sin
The more I get the more I want
She wants to own me
Come closer
She says come closer

[Chorus]

Come Closer [x7]
I just can't stop no [x4]

[Chorus]

And I just can't pull myself away
Under her spell I can't break
I just can't stop [x5]

Come Closer
                        
                    |
