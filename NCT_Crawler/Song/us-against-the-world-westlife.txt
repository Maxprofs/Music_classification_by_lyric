                        [Nicky:]
Us against the world 
Against the world
Us against the world 
Against the world 

[Shane:]
You and I, we’ve been at it so long 
I still got the strongest fire 
You and I, we still know how to talk 
Know how to walk that wire 

[Mark:]
Sometimes I feel like The world is against me 
The sound of your voice, baby 
That's what saves me 
When we're together I feel so invincible 

[Shane:]
Cause it's us against the world 
You and me against them all 
If you listen to these words 
Know that we are standing tall 
I don't ever see the day that 
I won't catch you when you fall 
Cause it's us against the world tonight 

[Nicky:]
Us against the world 
Against the world 

[Mark:]
There’ll be days 
We’ll be on different sides but 
That doesn’t last too long 
We find ways to get it on track 
And know how to turn back on 

[Shane:]
Sometimes I feel 
I can’t keep it together 
Then you hold me close 
And you make it better 
When I’m with you 
I can feel so unbreakable 

[Mark:]
Cause it's us against the world 
You and me against them all 
If you listen to these words 
Know that we are standing tall 
I don't ever see the day that 
I won't catch you when you fall 
Cause it's us against the world tonight 

We’re not gonna break 
Cause we both still believe 
We know what we’ve got 
And we’ve got what we need alright 
We’re doing something right...

[Shane & Mark:]
Cause it's us against the world 
You and me against them all 
If you listen to these words 
Know that we are standing tall 
I don't ever see the day that 
I won't catch you when you fall 
Cause it's us against the world tonight 

Us against the world 
You and me against them all 
If you listen to these words 
Know that we are standing tall 
I don't ever see the day that 
I won't catch you when you fall 
Us against the world 
Yeah it’s Us against the world, baby 
Us against the world 
Tonight 

[Nicky:]
Us against the world 
Against the world 
Us against the world
