                        Bài hát: Queen Of My Heart - Bad Boys Blue

So here we stand in our secret place
Where the sound of the crowd is so far away
You take my hand and it feels like home
We both understand it's where we belong

So how do I say
Do I say goodbye
We both have our dreams
We both wanna fly
So let's take tonight to carry us through
The lonely times

I'll always look back as I walk away
This memory will last for eternity
And all of our tears will be lost in the rain
When I find my way back to your arms again
But until that day you know you are the queen of my heart

So let's take tonight and never let go
While dancing we'll kiss like there's no tomorrow
As the stars sparkle down like a diamond ring
I'll treasure this moment till we meet again

But no matter how far (no matter how far)
Or where you may be (where you may be)
I just close my eyes (just close my eyes)
And you're in my dreams
And there you will be
Until we meet

I'll always look back as I walk away
This memory will last for eternity
And all of our tears will be lost in the rain
When I find my way back to your arms again
But until that day you know you are the queen of my heart

You're the queen of my heart (queen of my heart)
No matter how many years it takes (queen of my heart)
I'll do it all to you
Oh yes you areThe queen of my heart
                        
                    |
