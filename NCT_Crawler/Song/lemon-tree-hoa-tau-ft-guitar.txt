Không Lời|

                        I'm sitting here in a boring room
It's just another rainy Sunday afternoon
I'm wasting my time I got nothing to do
I'm hanging around I'm waiting for you
But nothing ever happens - and I wonder

I'm driving around in my car
I'm driving too fast I'm driving too far
I'd like to change my point of view
I feel so lonely I'm waiting for you
But nothing ever happens - and I wonder

*I wonder how I wonder why
Yesterday you told me 'bout a blue blue sky
And all that I can see
It's just a yellow lemon tree

I'm turning my head up and down
I'm turning turning turning turning
turning around
And all that I can see
It's just another yellow lemon tree*

I'm sitting here I miss there power
I'd like to go out taking a shower
But there's a heavy cloud inside my head
I feel so tired put myself into bed
Where nothing ever happens - and I wonder
                        
                    |
