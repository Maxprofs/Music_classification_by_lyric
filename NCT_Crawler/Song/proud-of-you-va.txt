                        Bài hát: Proud Of You - V.A

[Verse 1] 
Love in your eyes 
Sitting silent by my side 
Going on Holding hand 
Walking through the nights 
Hold me up Hold me tight 
Lift me up to touch the sky 
Teaching me to love with heart 
Helping me open my mind 

[Chorus] 
I can fly 
I'm proud that I can fly 
To give the best of mine 
Till the end of the time 
Believe me I can fly 
I'm proud that I can fly 
To give the best of mine 
The heaven in the sky 

[Verse 2] 
Stars in the sky 
Wishing once upon a time 
Give me love Make me smile 
Till the end of life 
Hold me up Hold me tight 
Lift me up to touch the sky 
Teaching me to love with heart 
Helping me open my mind 

[Chorus] 
I can fly 
I'm proud that I can fly 
To give the best of mine 
Till the end of the time 
Believe me I can fly 
I'm proud that I can fly 
To give the best of mine 
The heaven in the sky 

[Bridge] 
Can't you believe that you light up my way 
No matter how that ease my path 
I'll never lose my faith 

[Chorus] 
See me fly 
I'm proud to fly up high 
Show you the best of mine 
Till the end of the time 
Believe me I can fly 
I'm singing in the sky 
Show you the best of mine 
The heaven in the sky 
Nothing can stop me 
Spread my wings so wide
                        
                    |
