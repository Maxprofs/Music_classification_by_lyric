Shayne ward - Over the rainbow

Somewhere over the rainbow, way up high
There's a land that I heard of once in a lullaby

Someday I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me
Where troubles melt like lemon drops
Away above the chimney tops
That's where...that's where you'll find me
oh~Somewhere over the rainbow, bluebirds fly
Birds fly over the rainbow
then why oh~ why can't I ?
Why can't ...I ?
