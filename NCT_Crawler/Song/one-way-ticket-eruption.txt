                        One way ticket, one way ticket
One way ticket, one way ticket
One way ticket, one way ticket to the blues.

Choo choo train
Tuckin' down the track
Gotta travel on it
Never comin' back
Ooh, ooh got a one way ticket to the blues.

Bye my love, my babe is leavin' me
Now, only tear drops are all that I could see.

Ooh, ooh
Got a one way ticket to the blues

Gotta take a trip to lonesome town
Gonna stay at heartbreak hotel.
A fool such as I such as I
Will never, I cry my tears away.

One way ticket, one way ticket
One way ticket, one way ticket
One way ticket, one way ticket to the blues.

Choo choo train
Tuckin' down the track
Gotta travel on it
Never comin' back
Ooh, ooh got a one way ticket to the blues.

Gotta go on, gotta truck on
Got a one way ticket to the blues.

I gotta take a trip to lonesome town
Gonna stay at heartbreak hotel
Ooh, a fool such as I, such as I
Will never I cry my tears away.

One way ticket, one way ticket
One way ticket, one way ticket
One way ticket, one way ticket to the blues.

Choo choo train
Tuckin' down the track
Gotta travel on it
Never comin' back
Ooh, ooh got a one way ticket to the blues.
Ooh, ooh got a one way ticket to the blues.

Got my ticket...
One way, one way, one way ticket
