                        little love....
Greatness as you 
Smallest as me
You show me what is deep as sea

A little love,little kiss
A litlle hug, little gift
All of little something.these are our memories

You make me cry, make me smile
make me feel that love is true 
You always stand by my side
I don't want to say goodbye

You make me cry, make me smile
make me feel the joy of love
Oh kissing you
Thank you for all the love you always give to me
oh i love you

[repeat#]

Yes I do , I always do

Make me cry, make me smile
make me feel that love is true
You always stand by my side 
I don't want to say goodbye

[repeat#]

To be with you, oh i love you
