                        Bài hát: I Feel Like I'M Drowning - Two Feet

You keep dreaming and dark scheming
Yeah, you do
You're a poison and I know that is the truth
All my friends think you're vicious
And they say you're suspicious
You keep dreaming and dark scheming

Yeah, you do
I feel like I'm drowning
I'm drowning
You're holding me down and
Holding me down
You're killing me slow
So slow, oh-no

I feel like I'm drowning
I'm drowning
You're so plastic and that's tragic
Just for you
I don't know what the hell you gonna do
When your looks start depleting
And your friends all start leaving
You're so plastic and that's tragic

Just for you
I feel like I'm drowning
I'm drowning
You're holding me down and
Holding me down
You're killing me slow
So slow, oh-no
I feel like I'm drowning
I'm drowning

My life's okay
Yeah, just when you're not around me
My life's okay
Just when you're not around me
My life's okay
Just when you're not around me
My life's okay

I feel like I'm drowning
I'm drowning
You're holding me down and
Holding me down
You're killing me slow
So slow, oh-no
I feel like I'm drowning
I'm drowning
