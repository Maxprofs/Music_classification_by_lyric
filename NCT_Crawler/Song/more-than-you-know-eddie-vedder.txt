                        More than you know
 More than you know
 Lately I find you're on my mind
 More than you know Whether I'm right
 Whether I'm wrong
 I need you so
 More than you know
 More than you know Ooh, loving you the way that I do
 Oh, there's nothing I can do about it
 And a little bit of love that I get maybe all
 That you can give but I can't live without it Oh how I'd cry, oh how I'd cry
 Ooh, if you got tired and said goodbye
 More than I'd show
 More than you'd ever, ever know
 More than you know More than you'd ever, ever know
 More than you know
