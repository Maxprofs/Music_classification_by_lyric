                        Bài hát: Everyone Knows Juanita - Gael Garcia Bernal

Well, everyone knows Juanita
Her eyes each a different color
Her teeth go out and her chin goes in
And her knuckles, they drag on the floor

[CHICHARRÓN, spoken]
Those aren't the words

[HECTOR, spoken]
There are children present!

(Sung)

Her hair is like a briar
She stands in a bow-legged stance
And if I weren't so ugly, she'd possibly give me a chance
                        
                    |
