                        Bài hát: Waiting For The Rain - Maaya Sakamoto

I’m waiting for the rain
I’m bracing for the thunder
A twig that wouldn’t sway
In the wind

Awaken from a dream
Arising from a slumber
I’m far away from home
On my own

Hear my yearning
See the crimson flame
Like a ruby
It’s the hope
In my eye

If you go away
And I don’t see you anymore
I still wouldn’t sway
But I’d be
Missing you
Now don’t be afraid
You the flower couldn’t sting
You can hide in my shade
Or maybe I...
Could I be safe
In yours?

A moment left to bloom
I wither by the morning
Can we be staying here
For a while

Hear my yearning
See my raging light
It’s my token that we won’t
Say goodbye

If you go away
And I don’t see you anymore
I still wouldn’t sway
But I’d be
Missing you
Now don’t be afraid
You the flower couldn’t sting
You can hide in my shade
Or maybe I...

Would go away
And I don’t see you anymore
I still wouldn’t sway
But I’d be
Missing you
Now don’t be afraid
We are lasting yet awhile
I will give you a day
Or maybe I...
Could I have one
Of yours?

I’m waiting for the rain...
                        
                    |
