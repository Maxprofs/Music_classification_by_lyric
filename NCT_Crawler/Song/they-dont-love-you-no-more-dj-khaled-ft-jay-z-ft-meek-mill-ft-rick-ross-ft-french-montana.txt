                        Ever since a nigga hit the top
 Pussy niggas wanna see me in a box
 They don't love you no more
 They don't love you no more *** ain't been the same since I came through in that hot ***
 They gon' talk about you, you ain't got ***
 Still gon' talk about you when you got ***
 All eyes on Meek, I'm on my Pac ***
 Y'all rap niggas on some pop ***
 I've been ducking paparazzi with a pop bitch
 Glock 30 in the cockpit
 Sipping dirty, come and sail with the pilot
 Nigga, you ain't seen it, I've been *** up arenas
 I'm with double M, the genius, we the mother*** meanest
 And the cleanest in a long time
 You pussy niggas hating on me picked the wrong time
 Long line for a limp mink draggin', new bandwagon
 Blood dripping on me looking like a nigga stabbed him
 I be on the money, baking soda in the cabinet
 Pyrex, trying to whip a Rollie, making magic
 Laughing at you *** niggas getting madder
 If I feel threatened, I'mma go and get a ladder
 And climb up your chest, nigga, mother*** your vest, nigga
 Mother*** your couch, I'm with Khaled, the best, nigga Ever since a nigga hit the top
 Pussy niggas wanna see me in a box
 They don't love you no more (They don't love you no more)
 They don't love you no more, yeah Troops gotta cock, coupe's gotta drop
 *** starting to change, so you starting to change
 They don't love you no more
 They don't love you no more
 Should be your favorite, now you're just hatin'
 *** starting to change, you want me to change, nah
 They don't love you no more (They don't love you no more)
 They don't love you no more, nah Bullet in the head, they wanna see my shirt red
 Live by the code, it's the only way to play it
 Benz or the Rolls, Mulsanne overrated
 Half these niggas told, cut a deal, they'll take it
 Promise to never fold and the bonds still sacred
 Had to shake a couple niggas, everybody won't make it
 God is the greatest as I'm praying in the latest
 X600 as I swerve, Little Haiti
 Ou pa kap bat m'wen, sak pase!
 I'm busting out the sunroof, nigga, andal√©!
 My money always coming, no, I'm never on pause
 I bring you straight to your door if you a mother*** boss Ever since a nigga hit the top
 Pussy niggas wanna see me in a box
 They don't love you no more (They don't love you no more)
 They don't love you no more, yeah Troops gotta cock, coupe's gotta drop
 *** starting to change, so you starting to change
 They don't love you no more
 They don't love you no more
 Should be your favorite, now you're just hatin'
 *** starting to change, you want me to change, nah
 They don't love you no more (they don't love you no more)
 They don't love you no more Hold up, you ain't got love for me, my nigga?
 Ever meet another nigga like me, my nigga?
 Are you sure? A nigga flip this *** like Jarl Borg
 A nigga did this ***, this hardcore
 If you say it, guess it's true though, kudos, I mean, but who knows?
 Salute to all the real niggas out there finding the loopholes
 *** all these *** niggas, hate when niggas come up, ah!
 Hopped off the plane, hit the helicopter
 Tell these crabs in the barrel we eating hella lobster
 Got hella options, like a college team
 Hit these bootleg niggas with the Heisman
 *** the NCAA nigga, let a young nigga get paid, nigga
 Niggas talking down on the crown
 Watch them niggas you 'round got you wrong
 Haters wanna ball, let me tighten up my draw string
 Wrong sport, boy, you know you're as soft as a Lacrosse team
 Raahh! Ever since a nigga hit the top
 Pussy niggas wanna see me in a box
 They don't love you no more (They don't love you no more)
 They don't love you no more, yeah Troops gotta cock, coupe's gotta drop
 *** starting to change, so you starting to change
 They don't love you no more
 They don't love you no more
 Should be your favorite, now you're just hatin'
 *** starting to change, you want me to change, nah
 They don't love you no more (They don't love you no more)
 They don't love you no more, nah You don't love me no more?
 All the *** I done for you, you don't love me no more?
