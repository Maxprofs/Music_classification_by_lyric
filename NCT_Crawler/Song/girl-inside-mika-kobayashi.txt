                        Bài hát: Girl Inside - Mika Kobayashi

I'm swallowed, whole inside
This chaotic world so easily
Silent wind just blows across
An outer space between light and dark
I was born out of, this great divide 
Runs through the barren ground
I need to live my life

Enough before all the leaves
Fall to pieces till I am burned out
Oh! My body knows
Just like my blood
Our fight still keep flowing
I must struggle to survive
So the beautiful and perfect world
Comes back to life

They come out
Pouring with protean threats, through billowing fog
Decayed world just make me see
The borderline between light and dark
I was born out of, this great divide 
Runs through the barren ground
I need to live my life

Enough before all the leaves
Fall to pieces till I am burned out
Oh! My body knows
Just like my blood
Our fight still keep flowing
I must struggle to survive
So the beautiful and perfect world
Comes back to life
                        
                    |
