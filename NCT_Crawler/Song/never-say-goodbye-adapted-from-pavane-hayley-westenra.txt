                        If I could take this moment forever
 Turn the pages of my mind
 To another place and time
 We would never say goodbye

 If I could find the words I would speak them
 Then I wouldn't be tongue-tied
 When I looked into your eyes
 We would never say goodbye

 If I could stop the moon ever rising
 Day would not become the night
 Wouldn't feel this cold inside
 And we'd never say goodbye

 I wish that our dreams were frozen
 Then our hearts would not be broken
 When we let each other go...

 If I could steal this moment forever
 Paint a picture-perfect smile
 So our story stayed alive
 We would never say goodbye
                        
                    |
