                        ...Damn you
You little prying Pandora
You little demon
Is this what you wanted to see?
Curse you, you little lying Delilah
You little viper
Now you cannot ever be free
Damn you, curse you...

Stranger than you dreamt it
Can you even dare to look, or bear to think of me 
This loathesome gargoyle
Who burns in hell, But secretly yearns for heaven
Secretly, secretly...
Oh Christine...

Fear can turn to love
You'll learn to see, to find the man behind the monster
This repulsive carcass
Who seems a beast but secretly dreams of beauty,
Secretly, secretly...
Oh, Christine...

(Christine hands the Phantom his mask) 

[Phantom, speaking]
Come, we must return, those two fools who run my theatre will be missing you.
