                        [Will. I. Am]
 Four, tres, two, uno

 Listen up y'all, cause this is it
 The beat that I'm banging is delicious

 [Fergie]
 Fergalicious definition make them boys go loco
 They want my treasure so they get their pleasures from my photo
 You can see me, you can't squeeze me
 I ain't easy, I ain't sleazy
 I got reasons why I tease 'em
 Boys just come and go like seasons

 Fergalicious (Fergalicious)
 But I ain't promiscuous
 And if you were suspicious
 All that *** is fictitious
 I blow kisses (muahhh)
 That puts them boys on rock rock
 And they be lining down the block just to watch what I got
 (Four, tres, two, uno)

 So delicious (It's hot hot)
 So delicious (I put them boys on rock rock)
 So delicious (They want a slice of what I got)
 I'm Fergalicious (t-t-t-t-t tasty, tasty)

 Fergalicious def-, Fergalicious def-, Fergalicious def-
 Fergalicious definition make them boys go crazy
 They always claim they know me
 Coming to me call me Stacey (Hey Stacey)
 I'm the F to the E, are, G the I the E
 And can't no other lady put it down like me

 I'm Fergalicious (So delicious)
 My body stay vicious
 I'll be up in the gym just working on my fitness
 He's my witness (Oooh whee)
 I put yo' boy on rock rock
 And he be lining down the block just to watch what I got
 (Four, tres, two, uno)

 So delicious (It's hot hot)
 So delicious (I put them boys on rock rock)
 So delicious (They want a slice of what I got)
 I'm Fergalicious (Hold hold hold hold hold up, check it out)

 Baby, baby, baby
 If you really want me
 Honey get some patience
 Maybe then you'll get a taste
 I'll be tasty, tasty, I'll be laced with lacey
 It's so tasty, tasty, It'll make you crazy

 [Rap]
 All the time I turn around brothers gather round
 Always looking at me up and down looking at my (Uh)
 I just wanna say it now I ain't trying to round up drama
 Little mama I don't wanna take your man
 And I know I'm coming off just a little bit conceited
 And I keep on repeating how the boys wanna eat it
 But I'm trying to tell, that I can't be treated like clientele

 Cause they say she's delicious (So delicious)
 But I ain't promiscuous
 And if you was suspicious
 All that *** is fictitious
 I blow kisses (muahhh)
 That puts them boys on rock rock
 And they be lining down the block just to watch what I got
 (Got, got, got)

 Four, tres, two, uno
 My body stay vicious
 I be up in the gym just working on my fitness
 He's my witness (Oooh whee)
 I put yo' boy on rock rock
 And he be lining down the block just to watch what I got
 (Four, tres, two, uno)
