Title: On A Day Like Today
.
Free is all you gotta be
Dream dreams no one else can see
Sometimes ya wanna run away
but ya never know what might be comin' round your way
ya ya ya
On a day like today
The whole world could change
The sun's gonna shine
Dhine thru the rain
On a day like today
Ya never wanna see the sun go down
Ya never wanna see the sun go down
Somewhere - there's a place for you
I know that you believe it too
Sometimes if you wanna get away
All ya gotta know is what we got is here to stay
All the way
On a day like today
The whole world could change
The sun's gonna shine
Shine thru the rain
On a day like today
No one complains
Free to be pure
Free to be sane
On a day like today
ya never wanna see the sun go down
ya never wanna see the sun go down
...
Free is all we gotta be
Dream dreams no one else can see
But ya never know what might be comin' for you and me
ya it's gonna be
On a day like today...
The whole world could change
The sun's gonna shine
Shine thru the rain
On a day like today
No one complains
Free to be pure
Free to be sane
On a day like today
ya never wanna see the sun go down
ya never wanna see the sun go down
