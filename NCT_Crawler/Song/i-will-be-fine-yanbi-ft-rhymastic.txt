                        Bài hát: I Will Be Fine - Yanbi, Rhymastic

I thought I told you girl 
Nothing can stop me from 
Showing you my expression and giving you all my love 
No matter what 
I’ll do if I must 
Cuz girl you’re all that I want.

Even thought you said
We can’t be together 
I’m still in love with you 
I’ll never regret 
There is no turning back...

[Chorus:]
Just to let you know that I will be fine be fine be fine
I will be fine be fine be fine
I will be fine 
Even if I fine
Can’t make you mine 
Trust me when I say that I‘ll be fine
Say I’ll be fine 
Baby don’t worry about me cuz 
I’ll be fine

[Verse 2]
Do you know why I keep on lying
That I forgot you and I tried to move on with my life
Do you know why ? I don't know why...
My heart is lying right where you're at and now that I can't deny.

But I'm a strong guy
This love is one-side
Still I can manage to live with that
So I decided to love you for life
Believe me that I won't regret
And I will be fine...

[Chorus:]....
Lemme tell you girl I can't stop thinking about this love
Every thoughts of mine's gonna stay by your side all the way around world
And I...Give you all my heart
This love ain't never gonna fall aparts.

No return is asked and you know I've chosen this way right from the start.
Forever love I'm falling in
Keeping my feeling for you is all I need
Everything doesn't mean anything if I don't have you 
Cuz girl you mean more to me.

So let me walk this part alone
When you're my forever love there's nothing wrong with that
Baby you just keep moving on
Cuz I'm still here, looking out for you...Babe..

Ooohhh...Girl you're so far away
But still I fall for you every single night and day
You're everything to me
I will just keep saying this
I'm nothing without you...
But still this way I'll choose..
I'll be fine...
