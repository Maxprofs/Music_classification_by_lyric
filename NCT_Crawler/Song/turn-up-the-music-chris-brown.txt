                        Song: Turn Up The Music
Artist: Chris Brown

Turn up the music, cause this song just came on
Turn up the music, if they try to turn us down

Turn up the music, can I hear it til the speakers blow
Turn up the music, fill your cup and drink it down
If you're sexy and you know it put your hands up in the air
Put your hands up in the air, girl, put your hands up
(Hands up, hands up)
If you're sexy and you know it put your hands up in the air
Put your hands up in the air, girl, put your hands up

And turn up the music, just turn it up loud
Turn up the music, I need it in my life, yeah
Turn up the music, just turn it up loud
Turn up the music, I need it in my life, yeah

Turn up the music

Turn up the music

Turn turn the music

Turn turn up the...

Turn up the music cause the sun just came up
Turn up the music, if they try to turn us down

Turn up the music, cause i'm trying to hear the speakers blow
Turn up the music, fill your cup and drink it down
If you're sexy and you know it put your hands up in the air
Put your hands up in the air, girl, put your hands up
(Hands up, hands up)
If you're sexy and you know it put your hands up in the air
Put your hands up in the air, girl, put your hands up

And Turn up the music, just turn it up loud
Turn up the music, I need it in my life, yeah
