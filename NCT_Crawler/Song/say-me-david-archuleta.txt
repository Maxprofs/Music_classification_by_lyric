                        Bài hát: Say Me - David Archuleta

[Verse 1]
To each his own, given his own time
Speak for yourself, I speak for mine
Try to bring each other to the light we need
When the whole world has left you behind
The temperature has dropped inside
You need to know who's gonna find, say me

[Chorus]
I need you
I need you
I need you
To say me
I need you
I need you
I need you
To say me
Say me

[Verse 2]
Does your heart need reminding the answers to questions?
You lay beside when all you wanna do is fall asleep
Everyone starts to question why
Sees the rust where I see shine
You need someone to take aside
Say me

[Chorus]
I need you
I need you
I need you
To say me
I need you
I need you
I need you
To say me

[Bridge]
The sooner we start this life living as we're loved
Just put it behind us to see what we'll become
The sooner we start this life
Living as we're loved

[Chorus]
I need you
I need you
I need you
To say me
I need you
I need you
I need you
To say me
I need you
I need you
I need you
To say me
I need you
To say me
                        
                    |
