                        Mama, they try and break me The window burns
 To light the way back home
 A light that warms
 No matter where they've gone now They're off to find
 The hero of the day
 Oh, but what if they should fall
 By someone's wicked way Still the window burns, time so slowly turns
 And someone there is sighin'
 Keepers of the flames, do you feel your names?
 Can't you hear your baby's crying? Mama, they try and break me
 Still they try and break me S'cuse me
 While I tend to how I feel
 These things return to me
 That still seem real Now deservingly
 This easy chair
 But the rocking stopped
 By wheels of despair, yeah Don't want your aid but the fist I've made
 For years, can't hold or feel
 No, I'm not all me, so please excuse me
 While I tend to how I feel But now the dreams and waking screams
 That ever last the night
 So build a wall, behind it crawl
 And hide until it's light
 So can't you hear your baby's crying now? Still the window burns, time so slowly turns
 Someone there is sighin'
 Keepers of the flames, can't you hear your names?
 Can't you hear your baby's crying? But now the dreams and waking screams
 That everlast the night
 So build a wall, behind it crawl
 And hide until it's light
 So can't hear your baby's crying now? Mama, they try and break me
 Mama, they try and break me
 Mama, they try and break me
 Mama, they try, mama, they try Mama, they try and break me
 Mama, they try and break me
 Mama, they try and break me
 Mama, they try, mama, they try
