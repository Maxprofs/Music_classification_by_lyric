                        There was a bloody fight untold
Nobody seems to find their homes
Rain drops were falling all around
Let me escape this place
Be untouchable

Here comes scary lights
It's shin on me
Kill my breath
Till my worst fear is gone
We can't follow their rules whatsoever
Now we're climbing up
On the hill of sorrow

We're going to hell
is that where we wanna be?
What can you say?
Is that the way you are?
Why don't you just tell?
How is it gonna be?
We just can't be one

Here comes the scary light
It's shining on me
Hiding in this dusty hole
Till my worst fear is gone
We can't follow their rules whatsoever
Now we're climbing up
On the hill of sorrow
                        
                    |
