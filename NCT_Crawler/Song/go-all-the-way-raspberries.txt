                        Bài hát: Go All The Way - Raspberries

I never knew how complete love could be
Till she kissed me and said
Baby, please, go all the way
It feels so right
Being with you here tonight
Please, go all the way
Just hold me close
Don't ever let me go
I couldn't say what I wanted to say
Till she whispered, I love you
So, please, go all the way
It feels so right
Being with you here tonight
Please, go all the way
Just hold me close
Don't ever let me go
[Instrumental Interlude]
Before her love
I was cruel and mean
I had a hole in the place
Where my heart should have been
But now I've changed
And it feels so strange
I come alive when she does
All those things to me
And she says
(Come on), come on
(Come on)
(Come on), come on
(Come on)
I need you (come on)
I love you (come on)
I need you (come on)
(Come on)
Please, go all the way
It feels so right
Being with you here tonight
Please, go all the way
Just hold me close
Don't ever let me go, oh, no
                        
                    |
