                        Bài hát: More Than You Know - Axwell & Ingrosso

I just need to get it off my chest
Yeah, more than you know
Yeah, more than you know
You should know
That baby you're the best 
Yeah, more than you know
Yeah, more than you know

I saw it coming, from miles away
I better speak up
If I got something to say
'Cause it ain't over, until she sings

You had your reason
You had a few
But you knew that I would go
Anywhere for you
'Cause it ain't over, until she sings

I just need to get it off my chest
Yeah, more than you know
Yeah, more than you know
You should know
That baby you're the best
Yeah, more than you know
Yeah, more than you know
I just

Your good intentions
Are sweet and pure
But they can never
Tame a fire like yours
No it ain't over, until she sings

Right where you wanted
Down on my knees
You got me begging
Pretty baby set me free
'Cause it ain't over, until she sings
She sings
Come a little closer
Let me taste your smile
Until the morning lights
Ain't no going back
The way you look tonight
I see it in your eyes

I just need to get it off my chest
Yeah, more than you know
Yeah, more than you know
You should know
That baby you're the best
Yeah, more than you know
Yeah, more than you know
Yeah, more than you know
Yeah, more than you know
Yeah, more than you know
Yeah, more than you know
Yeah, more than you know
Yeah, more than you know
Yeah, more than you know
Yeah, more than you know
I just

I just need to get it off my chest
Yeah, more than you know
Yeah, more than you know
You should know
That baby you're the best 
Yeah, more than you know
Yeah, more than you know
