R&B/Hip Hop/Rap|

                        Just 'cause a nigga come in, he got style
 Don't think I won't flip it, don't pull your file
 But I got enough bull*** to deal with
 I'm rollin' with the thugs so You must be on drugs to the head
 Go, get your ass break down, broken half baby
 I'm a feelin' like a mother***in' psychopathic
 And if you got beef best leave it in the freezer I'm no joke, Mopreme straight lo
 And you could get smoked
 You hook the *** you get stroked and all of that
 And later be back for your mother***in' dope sack Kid it ain't the type of day to play dough nut
 Don't get your ass sewn up, why you leakin' on my blown out
 Hey, you're mixed up like a bowl of nuts
 You *** around and got it twisted up, boy, don't get it twisted Don't get it twisted, don't get it twisted
 Don't get it twisted, don't get it twisted
 Don't get it twisted, don't get it twisted
 Don't get it twisted, don't get it twisted It's the Macadoshis coming from the dark side
 The park side where the O.G.'s do ride
 Ain't nothing but killers in the park
 As many niggas lost their heart, when my gat sparks I'll bust a cap in that ass, don't get it twisted
 When I'm on a mission, niggas come with Mishy
 You busters gettin' disciplined
 And you're comin' up short on your life When I smoke you with this Mac-10
 When it's on it's on *** it
 I'm makin' niggas kick the bucket
 When I check 'em by induces Ain't no think to let my *** spin
 You on my *** list hope you got a death wish
 I tried to warn you but you missed me
 You should have listened mother***er when I said
 Don't get it twisted Don't get it twisted, don't get it twisted
 Don't get it twisted, don't get it twisted
 Don't get it twisted, don't get it twisted Niggas got problems about gettin' *** twisted
 They need to stay the *** out of grown folks business
 Kids get a kick out of bumpin' their big clips
 But don't front no *** that brought no *** that peace started 'Cause I'm a cold hearted rider straight dunkin'
 Never through with my streets, never hurt nobody but my heat
 East side brothers don't hear me though
 They'd rather get *** twisted and gather like hoes Bitch make ass niggas when I caught 'em
 Couldn't bust a drape if they wanted
 They're soft like Charmin but I don't sweat varmints
 I suffer with my black group Just a one-day murderer On the mother***in' Rudy Poop I snapped his soul, son
 Ain't no damn thing funny when I spray your ass with my tongue
 And your mommy can't save you now
 'Cause you got the job twisted up for ***in' with a killer Don't get it twisted, don't get it twisted
 Don't get it twisted, don't get it twisted
 Don't get it twisted, don't get it twisted
