                        Bài hát : Wild - Troye Sivan, Alessia Cara

[Verse 1: Troye Sivan]
Trying hard not to fall
On the way home
You were trying to wear me down, down
Kissing up on fences
And up on walls
On the way home
I guess it's all working out, now

[Pre-Chorus: Troye Sivan]
Cause there's still too long to the weekend
Too long till I drown in your hands
Too long since I've been a fool, oh
[Chorus: Troye Sivan]
Leave this blue neighbourhood
Never knew loving could hurt this good, oh
And it drives me wild
Cause when you look like that
I've never ever wanted to be so bad, oh
It drives me wild
You're driving me wild, wild, wild
You're driving me wild, wild, wild
You're driving me wild

[Verse 2: Alessia Cara]
We’re alike you and I
Two blue hearts locked in our wrong minds
So can we make the most out of no time?
Can you hold me?
Can you make me leave my demons & my broken pieces behind?

[Pre Chorus: Alessia Cara + Troye Sivan]
Cause there's still too long to the weekend
Too long till I drown in your hands
Too long since I've been a fool, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus: Troye Sivan + Alessia Cara]
Leave this blue neighbourhood
Never knew loving could hurt this good, oh
And it drives me wild
Cause when you look like that
I've never ever wanted to be so bad, oh
It drives me wild
You're driving me wild, wild, wild

[Bridge: Troye Sivan + Alessia Cara]
You make my heart shake
Bend and break
But I can't turn away
And it's driving me wild
You're driving me wild

[Chorus: Troye Sivan + Alessia Cara]
You make my heart shake
Bend and break
But I can't turn away
And it's driving me wild
You're driving me wild
Leave this blue neighbourhood
Never knew loving could hurt this good, oh
And it drives me wild
Cause when you look like that
I've never ever wanted to be so bad, oh
It drives me wild

[Outro: Alessia Cara]
You're driving me wild, wild, wild
                        
                    |
