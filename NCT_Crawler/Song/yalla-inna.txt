                        Bài hát: Yalla - Inna

Come on ladies get ready 
The music is playing 
One more time let's go crazy 

Tonight, tonight, tonight
I'mma gonna take you so high

Can you hear my heart beating for you?
Dream wide awake, boy, make it true
Can you hear my heart beating for you?
Come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on

Yalla habib yalla moch hala techrekni bhawak
Ya lghali enta w kol aridah akoun maak
Yalla habib yalla moch hala techrekni bhawak
Ya lghali enta w kol aridah akoun maak
