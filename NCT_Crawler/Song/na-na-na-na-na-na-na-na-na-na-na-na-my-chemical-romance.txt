                        (Na Na Na...)
Drugs
Gimme drugs
Gimme drugs
I don't need 'em
But I'll sell what you got
Take the cash
And I'll keep it
Eight legs to the wall
Hit the gas
Kill 'em all
And we crawl
And we crawl
And we crawl
You be my detonator
Love
Gimme love
Gimme love
I don't need it
But I'll take what I want
From your heart
And I'll keep it in a bag
In a box
Put an "X" on the floor
Gimme more
Gimme more
Gimme more
Shut up and sing it with me
(Na Na Na...)
For my security
To every enemy
We're on your property
Standing in V formation
(Na Na Na...)
A swollen artery
Get plastic surgery
Keep your apology
Give us more detonation
(More! Gimme more! Gimme more!)
Oh, let me tell ya 'bout the sad man
Shut up and let me see your jazz hands
Remember when you were a madman
Thought you was Batman
And hit the party with a gas can
Kiss me you animal
(Na Na Na...)
You run the company?
You're * kidding me!
I think we'd rather be
Burning your information
A swollen artery
Get plastic surgery
Keep your apology
Give us more detonation
And right here
Right now
All the way in Battery City
Little children
Raise their open filthy palms
Like tiny daggers up to heaven
And all the juvie halls
And radiator rats
And the angels
Made from neon and * garbage
Scream out
"What will save us?"
And the sky opened up
Everybody wants to change the world
Everybody wants to change the world
But no one,
No one wants to die
Wanna try, wanna try, wanna try
Wanna try, wanna try, oh
I'll be your detonator
(Na Na Na...)
Make no apology
And step the * away
On my authority
Crash and burn
Young and loaded
Drop like a bullet shell
Just like a sleeper cell
I'd rather go to hell
Than be in purgatory
Cut my hair
Gag and bore me
Pull this pin
Let this world explode"
