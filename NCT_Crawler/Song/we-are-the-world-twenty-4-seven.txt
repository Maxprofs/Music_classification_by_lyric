                        Oooh!
 We are the world, so sing everybody
 Oooh!
 Take my hand and show that you've got it Na na na na neh
 Na na na na neh
 Na na na na neh na
 We are the world Check one check two and hold on
 Come down the right time to move on
 It is a hard time, but it's a good time
 It is a real life, oh so prime time We all are one
 Share the same big moon and the sun
 It's the future for a boy & girl
 We are the world ! Keep it up and down
 And don't stop 'till I stop
 I'll play my game until I drop
 We're not here to live for eternity
 So let's make the best of the time to be So many races
 All the beauty in all the faces
 We've got diamonds
 We've got pearls
 We are the world
