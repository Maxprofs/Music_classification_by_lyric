                        Immortals:

They say we are what we are
But we don’t have to be
I’m bad behavior but I do it in the best way
I’ll be the watcher (watcher) of the eternal flame
I’ll be the guard dog of all your fever dreams
(oh...) I am the sand in the bottom half of the hourglass. (glass, glass)
(oh...) I’ll try to picture me without you but I can’t

[Chorus]
'Cause we could be immortals, immortals
Just not for long, for long
And if we meet forever now, pull the blackout curtains down
Just not for long, for long
We could be immortals, immortals, immortals, immortals
(Immortals)

Sometimes the only payoff for having any faith
Is when it’s tested again and again everyday
I’m still comparing your past to my future
It might be your wound, but they’re my sutures


I am the sand, bottom half of the hourglass. (glass, glass)
I’ll try to picture me without you but I can’t

[Chorus]
'Cause we could be immortals, immortals
Just not for long, for long
And if we meet forever now, pull the blackout curtains down
Just not for long, for long
We could be immortals, immortals
Immortals

And if we meet forever now
Pull the blackout curtains down
We could be immortals, immortals
Just not for long, for long
We could be immortals, immortals, immortals, immortals

Centuries:

Some legends are told
Some turn to dust or to gold
But you will remember me
Remember me for centuries
And just one mistake
Is all it will take.
We'll go down in history
Remember me for centuries
Remember me for centuries

Mummified my teenage dreams
No, it's nothing wrong with me
The kids are all wrong,
The stories are off
Heavy metal broke my heart

Come on, come on and let me in
The bruises on your thighs like my fingerprints
And this is supposed to match
The darkness that you felt
I never meant for you to fix yourself

Some legends are told
Some turn to dust or to gold
But you will remember me
Remember me for centuries
And just one mistake
Is all it will take.
We'll go down in history
Remember me for centuries
Remember me for centuries

And I can't stop 'til the whole world knows my name
'Cause I was only born inside my dreams
Until you die for me, as long as there is a light, my shadow's over you
'Cause I am the opposite of amnesia
And you're a cherry blossom
You're about to bloom
You look so pretty, but you're gone so soon

Some legends are told
Some turn to dust or to gold
But you will remember me
Remember me for centuries
And just one mistake
Is all it will take.
We'll go down in history
Remember me for centuries
Remember me for centuries

We've been here forever
And here's the frozen proof
I could scream forever
We are the poisoned youth

Some legends are told
Some turn to dust or to gold
But you will remember me
Remember me for centuries
And just one mistake
Is all it will take,
We'll go down in history
Remember me for centuries

We'll go down in history
Remember me for centuries
                        
                    |
