                        Bài hát: Fool Again (2000 Remix) - Westlife

Baby
I know the story
I've seen the picture
It's written all over your face
Tell me
What's the secret
That you've been hiding
And who's gonna take my place

I should have seen it coming
I should've read the signs
Anyway
I guess it's over

Can 't believe that I'm the fool again
I thought this love would never end 
How was I to know?
You never told me
Can't believe that I'm the fool again
And I who thought you were my friend
How was I to know?
You never told me.

Baby
You should have called me
When you were lonely
When you needed me to be there
Sadly
You never gave me
Too many chances
To show you how much I care

I should have seen it coming
I should've read the signs
Anyway
I guess it's over

Can 't believe that I'm the fool again
I thought this love would never end 
How was I to know?
You never told me
Can't believe that I'm the fool again 
And I who thought you were my friend
How was I to know?
You never told me.

About the pain and the tears,
oh oh oh,
If I could I would,
Turn back the time

Ooh yeah
I should've seen it coming
I should've read the signs
Anyway...
I guess it's over

Can 't believe that I'm the fool again,
I thought this love would never end 
How was I to know?
You never told me, 

Can't believe that I'm the fool again 
And I who thought you were my friend,
How was I to know?
You never told me.Can 't believe that I'm the fool again,
I thought this love would never end 
How was I to know?
You never told me, 
Can't believe that I'm the fool again 
And I who thought you were my friend,
How was I to know?
You never told me.
