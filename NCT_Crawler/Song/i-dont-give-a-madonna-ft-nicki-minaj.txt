                        Wake up ex-wife
 This is your life
 Children on your own
 Turning on the telephone
 Messengers, manager
 No time for a manicure
 Working out, shake my ass
 I know how to multi-task
 Connecting to the WIFI
 Went from nerd to superb
 Have you seen the new guy?
 I forgot the password
 Gotta call the babysitter
 Tweetin' on the elevator
 I could take a helicopter
 I don't even feel the pressure I'm gonna be okay
 I don't care what the people say
 I'm gonna be alright
 Gonna live fast and I'm gonna live right I'm moving fast can you follow my track?
 I'm moving fast and I like it like that
 I do ten things all at once
 And if you have a problem
 I don't give a You were so mad at me
 Who's got custody
 Lawyers suck it up
 Didn't have a pre-nup
 Make a film, write a song
 Gotta get my stockings on
 Meet the press, buy the dress
 All of this to impress
 Ride my horse, break some bones
 Take it down a semitone
 I forgot to say my prayers
 Baby Jesus on the stairs
 Gotta sign a contract
 Gotta get my money back
 All the biters have to go
 Standing in the front row I'm gonna be okay
 I don't care what the people say
 I'm gonna be alright
 Gonna live fast and I'm gonna live right I'm moving fast can you follow my track?
 I'm moving fast and I like it like that
 I do ten things all at once
 And if you have a problem
 I don't give a I tried to be a good girl
 I tried to be your wife
 Diminished myself
 And I swallowed my light
 I tried to become all
 That you expect of me
 And if it was a failure
 I don't give a I don't give a
 I don't give a
 I don't give a
 I don't give a Shots fire, anything you hear Nicki on, that's fire
 You don't hear them bums on nothin', that's fire
 Tell 'em, catch fire
 In the Bugatti, ten grand, one tire
 Ayo Madonna, Nicki ah say you original Don Dada
 Inna ya Gabbana, Inna all ya Prada
 We material girls, ain't nobody hotter
 Pops collar
 See I really can't relate to your Volvo
 And you can't get these shoes at a Aldo
 When I let a dude go, that's his loss
 I was cuttin' him checks, I was his boss
 Yo I don't give a f you, a curse, nor bless you
 Never let them stress you.
 I ain't a business woman, I'm a business, woman
 And I'm known for giving bitches the business, woman I'm gonna be okay
 I don't care what the people say
 I'm gonna be alright
 Gonna live fast and I'm gonna live right I'm moving fast can you follow my track?
 I'm moving fast and I like it like that
 I do ten things all at once
 And if you have a problem
 I don't give a There's only one queen, and that's Madonna
