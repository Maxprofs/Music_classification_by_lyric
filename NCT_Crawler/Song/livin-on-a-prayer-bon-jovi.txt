                        Tommy used to work on the docks
Union's been on strike
He's down on his luck...it's tough, so tough
Gina works the diner all day
Working for her man, she brings home her pay
For love - for love

She says: We've got to hold on to what we've got
It doesn't make a difference
If we make it or not
We've got each other and that's a lot
For love - we'll give it a shot

Ohh We're half way there
Woah Livin' on a prayer
Take my hand and we'll make it - I swear
Woah Livin' on a prayer

Tommy's got his six string in hock
Now he's holding in what he used
To make it talk - so tough, it's tough
Gina dreams of running away
When she cries in the night
Tommy whispers: Baby it's okay, someday

We've got to hold on to what we've got
'Cause it doesn't make a difference
If we make it or not
We've got each other and that's a lot
For love - we'll give it a shot

Ohh We're half way there
Woah Livin' on a prayer
Take my hand and we'll make it - I swear
Woah Livin' on a prayer
Livin' on a prayer

We've got to hold on ready or not
You live for the fight when thats all that you've got

Ohh We're half way there
Woah Livin' on a prayer
Take my hand and we'll make it - I swear
Woah Livin' on a prayer 
(Repeat to fade)
