i can be sincere and say I like them \"
Bjork
\" You can't say no to hope, can't say no to happiness\"
\" I wan't to go on a mountain-top
with a radio and good batteries
play a joyous tune
\"I'm no *** Buddhist, but this is enlightenment\"
\"The less room you give me, the more space I've got\"
\"This is an alarm-call so wake-up wake-up now\"
\"Today has never happened and it doesn't frighten me\"
