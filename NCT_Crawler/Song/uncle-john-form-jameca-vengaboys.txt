8 o'clock get up 
get outta bed, 
I feel like a truck 
ran over my head, 
another day of 
stress and sorrow. 
Skip breakfast 
'cause I gotta go, 
ain't got no time 
to take it slow 
and I will do my hair 
tomorrow. 
I can't take it no more, 
oh no no no, 
is this what I'm living for? 
But my uncle John 
from Jamaica 
keeps on calling 
every day: 
"Just buy a ticket 
and take a 
summer holi, 
holiday".

6 o'clock my job 
is still not done, 
the life I'm living 
ain't no fun, 
too many days 
of stress and sorrow. 
My boss just won't 
give me a break 
and this is more than 
I can take, 
think I will quit 
this job tomorrow. 
I can't take 
it no more, 
oh no no no,
