                        Bài hát: All We Know - The Chainsmokers, Phoebe Ryan 

[Verse 1: Phoebe Ryan and Andrew Taggart] 
Fighting flames of fire 
Hang onto burning wires 
We don’t care anymore 
Are we fading lovers? 
We keep wasting colors 
Maybe we should let this go 

[Pre-Chorus: Phoebe Ryan] 
We’re falling apart, still we hold together 
We’ve passed the end, so we chase forever 
‘Cause this is all we know 
This feeling’s all we know 
[Chorus: Phobe Ryan] 
I’ll ride my bike up to the world 
Down the streets right through the city 
I’ll go everywhere you go 
From Chicago to the coast 
You tell me, “Hit this and let’s go 
Blow the smoke right through the window” 
‘Cause this is all we know 

[Post-Chorus: Phoebe Ryan] 
‘Cause this is all we know 
‘Cause this is all we know 
‘Cause this is all we know 

[Verse 2: Phoebe Ryan and Andrew Taggart] 
Never face each other 
One but different covers 
We don’t care anymore 
Two hearts still beating 
On with different rhythms 
Maybe we should let this go 

[Pre-Chorus: Phoebe Ryan] 
We’re falling apart, still we hold together 
We’ve passed the end, so we chase forever 
‘Cause this is all we know 
This feeling’s all we know 

[Chorus: Phoebe Ryan] 
I’ll ride my bike up to the world 
Down the streets right through the city 
I’ll go everywhere you go 
From Chicago to the coast 
You tell me, “Hit this and let’s go 
Blow the smoke right through the window” 
‘Cause this is all we know 

[Post-Chorus: Phoebe Ryan] 
‘Cause this is all we know 
‘Cause this is all we know 
‘Cause this is all we know
                        
                    |
