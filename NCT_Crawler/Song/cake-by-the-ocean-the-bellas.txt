                        Bài hát: Cake By The Ocean - The Bellas

Oh, no
See you walking 'round like it's a funeral
Not so serious girl, why those feet cold?
We just getting started, don't you tiptoe, tiptoe, oh no

Waste time with a masterpiece
Don't waste time with a masterpiece
You should be rolling with me
You should be rolling with me
You're a real-life fantasy
You're a real-life fantasy
But you're moving so carefully
Let's start living dangerously

Talk to me, baby
I'm goin' blind from this sweet sweet craving, whoa-oh
Let's lose our minds and go crazy crazy
Ah ya ya ya ya I keep on hopin' we'll eat cake by the ocean
Walk for me, baby
I'll be Diddy, you'll be Naomi, whoa-oh
Let's lose our minds and go crazy crazy
Ah ya ya ya ya I keep on hopin' we'll eat cake by the ocean

***
See you licking frosting from your own hands
Want another taste, I'm begging, yes ma'am
I'm tired of all this candy on the dry land, dry land, oh

Waste time with a masterpiece, don't waste time with a masterpiece
You should be rolling with me, you should be rolling with me, ah
You're a real-life fantasy, you're a real-life fantasy
But you're moving so carefully, let's start living dangerously

Talk to me, baby
I'm going blind from this sweet sweet craving, whoa-oh
Let's lose our minds and go crazy crazy
Ah ya ya ya ya I keep on hoping we'll eat cake by the ocean
Walk for me, baby (walk for me now)
I'll be Diddy, you'll be Naomi, whoa-oh
Let's lose our minds and go crazy crazy
Ah ya ya ya ya I keep on hoping we'll eat cake by the ocean

Red velvet, vanilla, chocolate in my life
Funfetti, I'm ready, I need it every night
Red velvet, vanilla, chocolate in my life
I keep on hoping we'll eat cake by the ocean (funfetti, I'm ready)

Talk to me, baby
I'm going blind from this sweet sweet craving, whoa-oh
Let's lose our minds and go crazy crazy
Ah ya ya ya ya I keep on hoping we'll eat cake by the ocean
Walk for me, baby (walk for me baby)
I'll be Diddy, you'll be Naomi, whoa-oh
Let's lose our minds and go crazy crazy
Ah ya ya ya ya I keep on hoping we'll eat cake by the ocean, babe
