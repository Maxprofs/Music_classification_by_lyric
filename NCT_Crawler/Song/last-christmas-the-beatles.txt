                        Last Christmas

Wait
Oh yes, merry Christmas little girl
Hey!
Last year, you left me, little girl...

Last Christmas
I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year
To save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special

Once bitten and twice as shy
I keep my distance
But you still catch my eye
Tell me baby
Do you recognize me?
Well
It's been a year
It doesn't surprise me

Last christmas,
I wrapped it up and sent it
With a note saying "I love you"
I meant it
Now I know what a fool I've been
But if you kissed me now
I know you'd fool me again

Last Christmas
I gave you my heart (oh yeah)
But the very next day you gave it away (gave it away)
This year
To save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special

A crowded room
Friends with tired eyes
I'm hiding from you
And your soul of ice
My god I thought you were
Someone to rely on Me?
I guess I was a shoulder to cry on

A face on a lover with a fire in his heart
A man under cover but you tore me apart
Ooh, Now I've found a real love
You'll never fool me again

Last Christmas (twice as shy)
I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away (you still catch my eye)
This year
To save me from tears (do you recognize me?)
I'll give it to someone special (no, it doesn't surprise me)

Last Christmas (I wrapped it up and sent it)
I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away (saying "I love you" I meant it)
This year (what a fool i've been)
To save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special (I know you'll fool me again)

Last Christmas
I gave you my heart (oh yeah)
But the very next day you gave it away (gave it away)
This year
To save me from tears (from tears)
I'll give it to someone special (special)

Last Christmas (oh yeah)
I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away (gave it away)
This year
To save me from tears (from tears)
I'll give it to someone special (special)
