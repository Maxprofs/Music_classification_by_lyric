                        Giving up.why should i.i've come too far too forget.we're beautiful,we just got lost somewhere along the way,so much was missing when you went away.Let's start from here,lose the past,change our minds,we dont need a finish line.Let's take this chance,dont think too deep.Of all those promise we couldn't seem to keep.Let's start from here.Standing here,face to face,A finger on ur lips.Dont say a word Dont make a sound.silence surround us now.Even when you gone i felt you everywhere.Let's start from here,lose the past,change our minds,we dont need a finish line.Let's take this chance,dont think too deep.Of all those promise we couldn't seem to keep.I dont care where we go.Let's start fr here.I've never been the one to open up.But you've always been the voice within the only warmth from my cold heart. Let's start fr here,lose the past,change our minds,we dont need a finish line,Let's take this chance,dont think too deep.Of all those promise .let's st fr here,lose the past.Change our minds,we dont need a finish line.Let's take this chance,dont think too deep.Of all those promise we couldnt seem to keep,i dont care where we go.Let's start fr here..(-_-)fu!!! metwa
