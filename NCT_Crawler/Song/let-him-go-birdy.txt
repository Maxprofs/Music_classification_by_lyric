                        Bài hát: Let Him Go - Birdy

Staring at the bottom of your glass
Hoping one day you'll make a dream last
Dreams come slow and they go so fast
And you see him when you close your eyes
Maybe one day you'll understand why
Everything you touch surely dies

But you only need the light when it's burning low
You only miss the sun when it starts to snow
You only know you love him when you let him go

Staring at the ceiling in the dark
Same old empty feeling in your heart
'Cause love comes slow and it goes so fast
And you see him when you fall asleep
Never to touch never to keep
'Cause you loved him too much and you dive too deep

And you only need the light when it's burning low
You only miss the sun when it starts to snow
You only know you love him when you let him go
Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
You only hate the road when you're missing home
You only know you love him when you let him go
And you let him go
Oh oh oh no
And you let him go
Oh oh oh no
And you let him go
Oh oh oh
And you let him go
Oh oh oh

You only need the light when it's burning low
You only miss the sun when it starts to snow
You only know you love him when you let him go
Only know you've been high when you're feeling low
You only hate the road when you're missing home
You only know you love him when you let him go
And you let him go
                        
                    |
