                        Bài hát: Miss Right - Ne-Yo

Hello (hello), good evening (yeah)

Came in here and shut the world out
Nothing to get into, nothing to be about
Just grab a little bite, quiet little night
By no means looking for miss right
But hello (hello), good evening
Clearly she was out with her girls alone (that I could tell)
Beautiful with barely any make-up on (so natural)
The kind that make you wanna put the games away
Think about the future but first I’ll say
Hello (hello), good evening

Oh miss right (miss right)
What are you doing here
Oh miss right
Wasn’t expecting you tonight (oh oh)
Oh miss right (miss right)
How about we disappear (yeah)
Said if you got no plans
Baby if you got time
Come and be the rest of my life
Oh miss right (yeah yeah)

Well ain’t it amazing
Spend forever looking, all the time wasting
Soon as I throw my hands up and say I quit
Turn the corner and there my future sits
Hello (hello), good evening (good evening)
Clearly she was out with her girls alone (that I could tell)
Beautiful with barely any make-up on (so natural)
The kind that make you wanna put the games away
Think about the future but first I’ll say
Hello (hello), oh good evening

Oh miss right (miss right)
What are you doing today
(what are you doing here baby)
Wasn’t expecting you tonight (oh oh)
Oh miss right (miss right)
How about we disappear
Said if you got no plans
Baby if you got time
Come and be the rest of my life

Please forgive me if I’m forward
But this chance won’t pass me by
See I’m looking at forever
And it’s the most beautiful thing I’ve seen in my life

Ooh ooh miss right (miss right)
What are you doing here
(Said what are you doing here baby)
Wasn’t expecting you tonight
(I wasn’t expecting you tonight)
Oh miss right
How about we disappear (disappear babe)
Said if you got no plans
Baby if you got time
Come and be the rest of my life

(The rest of my life ai ai, life ai ai)
Miss right
What are you doing here
(The rest of my life ai ai, life ai ai)
Wasn’t expecting you tonight
Miss right
How about we disappear
Said if you got no plans
Baby if you got time
Come and be the rest of my life

Said if you got no plans
Baby if you got time
Come and be the rest of my life
