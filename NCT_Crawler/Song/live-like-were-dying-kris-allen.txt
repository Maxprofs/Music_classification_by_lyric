Kris Allen - Live like we're dying

Sometimes we fall down
can't get back up
we're hidin' behind skin that is too tough
how come we don't say I love you enough
till it's to late
it's not too late

Our hearts are hungry for a food that won't come
we could make a feast from these crumbs
and we're all staring down the barrel of a gun
so if your life flashed before you
what would you wish you would have done

Yeah we gotta start
lookin at the hands of the time we've been given
if this is all we got and we gotta start pickin
if every second counts on a clock that's tickin'
Gotta live like we're dying!

We only got 86,400 seconds in a day to
turn it all around or we'll throw it all away
we gotta tell 'em that we love 'em while we got the chance to say
Gotta live like we're dying!

And if your plane fell out of the skies
who would you call with your last goodbye
should be so careful who we let fall out our lives
so when we long for absolution
there'll no one on the line

Yeah we gotta start
lookin at the hands of the time we've been given
if this is all we got and we gotta start pickin
if every second counts on a clock that's tickin'
Gotta live like we're dying!

We only got 86,400 seconds in a day to
turn it all around or we'll throw it all away
we gotta tell 'em that we love 'em while we got the chance to say
Gotta live like we're dying!

Like we're dying oh, like we're dying!
Like we're dying oh, like we're dying!

We only got 86,400 seconds in a day to
turn it all around or we'll throw it all away
we gotta tell 'em that we love 'em while we got the chance to say
we gotta live like we're dying

You never know a good thing till it's gone
you never see a crash till it's head on
why do we think we're right when we're dead wrong
you never know a good thing till it's gone

Yeah we gotta start
lookin at the hands of the time we've been given
if this is all we got and we gotta start pickin
if every second counts on a clock that's tickin'
Gotta live like we're dying!

We only got 86,400 seconds in a day to
turn it all around or we'll throw it all away
we gotta tell 'em that we love 'em while we got the chance to say
Gotta live like we're dying!

Like we're dying oh, like we're dying!
Like we're dying oh, like we're dying!

We only got 86,400 seconds in a day to
turn it all around or we'll throw it all away
we gotta tell 'em that we love 'em while we got the chance to say
we gotta live like we're dying
