Gửi : Iốt - Bài hát 123

Chorus :
Hold, hold me for a while 
I know this won't last forever 
So hold, hold me tonight 
Before the morning takes you away 
(x2)

What's that sparkle in your eyes? 
Is it tears that I see? 
Oh tomorrow you are gone 
So tomorrow I'm alone 
Short moments of time 
We have left to share our love 

(Chorus)

We're in eachothers arms 
Soon we're miles apart 
Can you imagine how I'll miss, 
Your touch and your kiss? 
Short moments of time 
We have left to share our love 

(Chorus)

Hold, hold me now, 
From dusk all night to dawn
Save, save me now, 
A short moment of time

(Chorus)

Takes you away
                        
                    |
