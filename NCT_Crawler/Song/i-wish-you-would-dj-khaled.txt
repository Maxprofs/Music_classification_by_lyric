                        DJ Khlaed, Hit-Boy
 I'm so serious! One, two them boys coming for you (Huh!)
 Three, four, better lock your door (Huh!)
 Five, six, hide your bitch (Woo!) (Ayo Yeezy, pop your ***) They said, thou shall not be ill, thou shall not feel
 Thou should not be trill, not be drill, not be real
 Niggas selling packs, niggas flipping pills
 They got heroin and cracks, man these niggas hot for real
 Every year gon be our year, every year gon be my year
 These niggas really is out here, these niggas really is out here
 The block is at war, post traumatic stress
 Ran up outta pills, rob that CVS
 Niggas getting bust over "In God's We Trust"
 We believe in God but do God believe in us
 If we believe enough, will we ever get to know 'em
 That lean got us dozing, we forget that we the chosen I've been poppin' *** for too long
 But still reppin' where I came from
 I guess it's how I came up
 I wish you would try to play us I wish you would nigga (Woo!)
 I wish you would nigga (Woo!)
 I wish you would nigga (Woo!)
 I wish you would nigga (Huh!)
 I guess it's how I came up
 I wish you would try to play us My money on a another level
 In the streets I hear 'em hotter than the *** devil
 I wonder how I got a hundred in my *** bezel
 G5, make it rain, I can change the weather
 We fly them niggas lame, where your *** cheddar?
 Aim at your brain, AK be the *** letters
 *** niggas fall in alphabetical order
 Frank Lucas fur, the cap run more than a quarter
 I'm at the fight, ringside, right next to promoters
 All my niggas still hustle consider 'em roguish
 I remember catching buses just bought me a Lotus
 All your codes get decoded, know the niggas you quotin'
 Huh, my corner will scorch ya, somehow my flow is the coldest
 Money, power, respect, the only thing's truly important
 Family first, Khaled we gotta stay focused
 "God Forgives and I Don't" pussy niggas unnoticed I wish you would nigga (Woo!)
 I wish you would nigga (Woo!)
 I wish you would nigga (Woo!)
 I wish you would nigga
 I guess it's how I came up
 I wish you would try to play us (Huh!) I wish you would nigga, I wish you would nigga
 You see you got a couple cases, still look good nigga
 You see these niggas'll try to play ya, know how ya feel nigga
 Eh yup, that'd be the day you wanna kill a nigga
 But you gon' chill nigga, just for your kids nigga
 Cause now there's kids doing grown man biz' nigga
 You just got home nigga, you tryna live nigga
 Me I don't wanna do another 5 years nigga
 The boss is testing yo ass, the feds'll question yo ass
 They be drug testin' yo ass and then they pray you don't pass
 And then you look in the sky, you got some questions to ask
 With no response make you wanna grab the tech and the mac 'Cause they been poppin' *** for too long (Woo!)
 But still reppin' where I came from
 I guess it's how I came up
 I wish you would try to play us I wish you would nigga (Huh!)
 I wish you would nigga (Huh!)
 I wish you would nigga
 I wish you would nigga
 I guess it's how I came up
 I wish you would try to play us Rozay!
