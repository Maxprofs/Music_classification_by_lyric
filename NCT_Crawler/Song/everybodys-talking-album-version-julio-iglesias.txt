                        Bài hát: Everybody's Talking (Album Version) - Julio Iglesias

Everybody's talking at me
I don't hear a word they're saying
Only the echoes of my mind

People stopping, staring
I can't see their faces
Only the shadows of their eyes

I'm going where the sun keeps shining
Through the pouring rain
Going where the weather suits my clothes
Banking off of the northeast wind
Sailing on summer breeze
Skipping over the ocean like a stone

I'm going where the sun keeps shining
Through the pouring rain
Going where the weather suits my clothes
Banking off of the northeast wind
Sailing on a summer breeze
Skipping over the ocean like a stone

Everybody's talking at me
I can't hear a word they're saying
Only the echoes of my mind

I won't let you leave my love behind
I won't let you leave my love behind
...
