                        I've been looking for a driver who's qualified
 So if you think that you're the one
 Step into my ride
 I'm a fine-tuned supersonic
 Speed machine
 With a sunroof top and a gangster lean

 ~Bridge~
 So if you feel me let me know
 Know, know
 Come on now what you waiting for
 For, for

 My engine's ready to explode
 Explode, explode
 So start me up and watch me go
 Go, go, go

 ~Chorus~
 Got you where you wanna go
 If you know what I mean
 Got a ride that's smoother than a limousine
 Can you handle the curves?
 Can you run all the lights?
 If you can baby boy
 Then we can go all night

 'Cause I'm 0 to 60 in three point five
 Baby you got the keys

 Now shut up and drive
 (Drive, drive, drive)

 Shut up and drive
 (Drive, drive, drive)

 I got class like a' 57 Cadillac
 Got overdrive and a whole lot of
 Boom in the back
 You look like you can handle what's
 Under my hood
 You keep saying that you will boy
 I wish you would

 ~Bridge~
 So if you feel me let me know
 Know, know
 Come on now what you waiting for
 For, for

 My engine's ready to explode
 Explode, explode
 So start me up and watch me go
 Go, go, go

 ~Chorus~
 Got you where you wanna go
 If you know what I mean
 Got a ride that's smoother than a limousine
 Can you handle the curves?
 Can you run all the lights?
 If you can baby boy
 Then we can go all night

 'Cause I'm 0 to 60 in three point five
 Baby you got the keys

 Now shut up and drive
 (Drive, drive, drive)

 Shut up and drive
 (Drive, drive, drive)

 'Cause you play that game
 Got what I got
 Don't Stop It's a sure shot
 Ain't no Ferrari huh boy I'm sorry

 I ain't even worried
 So step inside and ride
 (Ride, ride, ride...)

 ~Bridge~
 So if you feel me let me know
 Know, know
 Come on now what you waiting for
 For, for

 My engine's ready to explode
 Explode, explode
 So start me up and watch me go
 Go, go, go

 ~Chorus~
 Got you where you wanna go
 If you know what I mean
 Got a ride that's smoother than a limousine
 Can you handle the curves?
 Can you run all the lights?
 If you can baby boy
 Then we can go all night

 'Cause I'm 0 to 60 in three point five
 Baby you got the keys

 Now shut up and drive
 (Drive, drive, drive)

 Shut up and drive
 (Drive, drive, drive)

 Now shut up and drive
 (Drive, drive, drive)

 Shut up and drive
 (Drive, drive, drive)
