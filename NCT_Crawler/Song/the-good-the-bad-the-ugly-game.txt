                        Yo you can keep asking them ***in questions all ***in day man
 I told you what
 I told you what the *** happened man
 Told your partner the same thing man,
 how long a nigga gotta stay here? There was money on the table with the bricks
 I was in the living room feeling on this bitch
 Heard my car alarm goin off on my 6
 So my dogs start barkin and some niggas hit the fence
 So I take my dick out this bitch mouth and walked to the window
 Pull the blinds down and took one hit of the Endo
 You niggas ain't doin ***, but stealin my neighbors rims so
 Walked back to the couch and told the bitch to bend over
 That's what I'm rolling with..
 Nah I ain't saying *** and I ain't snitching on nobody
 Yea that's my .45, but it ain't got no bodies
 And 2 dead niggas? Them is nobody..
 They should've torched em, then you wouldn't had no bodies
 I mean look at these pictures, just so sloppy
 Couldn't have been me, I do my *** like John Gotti
 Feed the nigga to the sharks after dark
 Man *** this *** I thought I told y'all There was money on the table by the bricks
 I was at the kitchen table choppin up some ***
 Listenin to Jeezy and I heard a little (bullet sound)
 So I turned the radio down and cocked my 4-Fif, oh ***..
 Am I hit? Nah just a hole in my Jordan fitted
 So I turn down all the lights and cock my 4-Fif
 Seen some niggas jump in they escalade and that was it
 How much longer I gotta stay in this mutha***a?
 Let me get a cigarette,
 I don't even smoke but *** y'all got a nigga stressed
 I gotta stay in this mutha***a until I confess?
 ***, y'all bitches better get some rest
 Cus it'll be a cold day in Miami
 Before I snitch on myself or the hood, you understand me?
 Ya I *** with the Bulls but I ain't Sammy
 Niggas run around the hood singin.. They should get a Grammy
 And you two mutha***as should get an Oscar
 With this good-cop-bad cop ***.. Take me to process
 Cus I don't eat breakfast with no pigs
 I watched First 48 so *** your 25 years
 No evidence, no big.
 I don't know who split them niggas' wigs Already told y'all, there was money on the table with the bricks
 I was walkin to the bathroom to take a ***
 Then I heard my dogs barkin, there's some noise by the fence
 So I ran to my room and reached for the 4 Fif
 Then I seen three niggas by my back door
 Looked out the bathroom window and seen two more
 So I reached for my chopper and some clips out the drawer
 Guess I had to welcome niggas to the gun store
