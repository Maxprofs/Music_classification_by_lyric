                        Bài hát: Stamp On The Ground - Italobrothers 

Stamp on the ground
Jump, jump, jump, jump
Moving all around
Tep tep da dow
Stamp on the ground
Jump, jump, jump, jump
Moving all around
We're jumping all around
Düp düp düp düp düp
Jumping all around

Drop the beat

We're jumping all around
Düp düp düp düp düp

We're sending out an invitation
To everyone in every nation
But don't sleep get on the run
Stop thinkin' and have some fun!

Stamp on the ground
Jump, jump, jump, jump
Moving all around
Tep tep da dow
Stamp on the ground
Jump, jump, jump, jump
Moving all around
We're jumping all around

Stamp on the ground
Jump, jump, jump, jump
Moving all around
Tep tep da dow
Stamp on the ground
Jump, jump, jump, jump
Moving all around
We're jumping all around
Düp düp düp düp düp

Drop the beat

So come and join our love foundation
Go feel the heat, the sweet vibration
'Cause we are about to ignite
And we wanna go out tonight!

Stamp on the ground
Jump, jump, jump, jump
Moving all around
Tep tep da dow
Stamp on the ground
Jump, jump, jump, jump
Moving all around
We're jumping all around
Düp düp düp
Jumping all around

Drop the beat

Jumping all around
Düp düp düp düp düp
Jumping all around
