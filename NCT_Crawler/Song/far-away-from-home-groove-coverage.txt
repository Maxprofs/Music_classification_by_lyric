                        'm loving living every single day
But sometimes I feel so
I hope to find a little peace of mind
And I just want to know.

And who can heal those tiny broken hearts,
And what are we to be.
Where is home on the milkyway of stars,
I dry my eyes again.

[Chorus]
In my dreams I'm not so far away from home,
What am I in a world so far away from home,
All my life all the time so far away from home,
Without you I'll be so far away from home.

If we could make it through the darkest
Night we'd have a brighter day.
The world I see beyond your pretty eyes,
Makes me want to stay.

And who can heal those tiny broken hearts,
And what are we to be.
Where is home on the Milky Way of stars,
I dry my eyes again.

[Chorus]

I count on you, no matter what they say,
Cause love can find it's time.
I hope to be a part of you again,
Baby let us shine.

And who can heal those tiny broken hearts,
And what are we to be.
Where is home on the Milky Way of stars,
I dry my eyes again.
                        
                    |
