They call me will-A 
Stay so cool, i'm chilley

On my way to that valley 
Used to have a piggy bank, but now I got that bigger bank. 
Who who cares what the haters state 
They hate on me cause we doing what they cant 

I stay on that hussle, I flex that loose to muscle 
Hate to bust your bubble

Imma take it higher and high and high and higher 
I stay and buy attire 
Keep burning like that fire 

And ooh, I'm alive, I'm alive, I'm alive 
And ooh, I can fly, I can fly, I can fly 
And ooh, I'm alive, I'm alive, I'm alive 
And im loving every second minute hour bigger better stronger power

We're good under pressure y'all 
Been through all that stress y'all 
Get this off my chest y'all 
Made it out in project where this project that's progress y'all 

I beat it through my mama 
I told her when I was younger 
That I'ma be that number 
One day I'll be that number 1 
I take it higher and high and high and higher 
I stay and buy attire 
Keep burning like that fire 


Whatever doesnt kill you, only makes you stronger 
So I'ma get stronger 
Call me like a veteran, veteran 
I lock lock it down and go again 
Call me like a veteran, veteran 
I lock lock it down and go again 

And ooh, I'm alive, I'm alive, I'm alive 
And ooh, I can fly, I can fly, I can fly 
And ooh, I'm alive, I'm alive, I'm alive
