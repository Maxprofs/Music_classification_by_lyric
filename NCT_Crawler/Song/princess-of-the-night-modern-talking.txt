                        Oh, I'm waiting
In the darkness
Hesitating in the darkness
Follow all your shadows in the night
I'm feeling it's burning
The point of no return, babe
Modern Talking
It's easy for two
Baby, it's so hard for one
Princess of the night
I'm drowning in the light
Princess of my dreams
'Cause fire I feeling
Princess of night
What have you done
Princess of night
Princess of day
When the night will fade away
Got a date, babe
With an angel
With a hot child of the city
Follow all your shadows in the night
Oh, somewhere, there's someone
When two hearts are beating as one
It's easy for two
It's so hard for one
                        
                    |
