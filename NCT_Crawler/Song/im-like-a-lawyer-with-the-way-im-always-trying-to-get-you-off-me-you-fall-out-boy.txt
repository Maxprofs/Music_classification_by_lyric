                        Last year's wishes are this year's apologies
 Every last time I come home
 I take my last chance to burn a bridge or two
 I only keep myself this sick in the head
 Cause I know how the words get you We're the new face of failure
 Prettier and younger but not any better off
 Bulletproof loneliness at best, at best Me and you, setting in a honeymoon
 If I woke up next to you, if I woke up next to you
 Me and you, setting in a honeymoon
 If I woke up next to you, if I woke up next to you Collect the bad habits that you couldn't bear to keep
 Out of the woods but I love
 A tree I used to lay beneath, kissed teeth stained red
 From the sour bottle baby girl with eyes the size of baby worlds We're the new face of failure
 Prettier and younger but not any better off
 Bulletproof loneliness at best, at best Me and you, setting in a honeymoon
 If I woke up next to you, if I woke up next to you
 Me and you, setting in a honeymoon
 If I woke up next to you, if I woke up next to you Me and you, setting in a honeymoon
 If I woke up next to you, if I woke up next to you
 Me and you, setting in a honeymoon
 If I woke up next to you, if I woke up next to you The best way to make it through
 With hearts and wrists intact
 Is to realize two out of three ain't bad
 Ain't bad! Me and you, setting in a honeymoon
 If I woke up next to you, if I woke up next to you
 Me and you
 (Honeymoon)
 Setting in a honeymoon Me and you, setting in a honeymoon
 If I woke up next to you, if I woke up next to you
 Me and you, setting in a honeymoon
 If I woke up next to you
 (Honeymoon)
