                        Bài hát: Crazy Remix - Hoàng Thùy Linh, Touliver

Yeah, I’m talking about you baby, huh ... Here we go ... 
Sexy, feel it in air so 
Naughty, I’ll take it off the richter
Maybe, if you treat me like a lady 
You might get something, a little something 
A little closer, put your hand on my hips
A little closer, feel the touch of my lips
Boy are you ready, I wanna do it again, do it again, do it again
Can’t take it no more, can’t take it no more tonight-i-ight
I can’t wait no more, I can’t wait no more tonight
Lately, I have had this feeling 
Take me, to another place 
No money, or diamond ring can buy my heart
I’m stronger, stronger than you think, but
A little closer, put your hand on my hips
A little closer, feel the touch of my lips
Boy are you ready, I wanna do it again, do it again, do it again
Can’t take it no more, can’t take it no more tonight-i-ight
I can’t wait no more, I can’t wait no more tonight
