                        Bài hát: Gift Of A Friend - Demi Lovato

Sometimes I think you'll be fine by yourself
Cause a dream is a wish you make all alone
It's easy to feel like you don't need help
But it's harder to walk on your own

You'll change inside
When you realize
The world comes alive
And everything's alright
From beginning to end
When you have a friend
By your side
That helps you find
The beauty of all when you'll open your heart
And believe in
The Gift of a Friend
The Gift of a Friend

Someone who knows when your lost and
Your scared
There through the highs and lows
Someone you can count on, someone who cares
Beside you wherever you go

You'll change inside
When you realize
The world comes to life
And everything's alright
From beginning to end
When you you have a friend
By your side
That helps you find
The beauty of all when you open your hearts
And believe in
The Gift of a Friend

And when your hope crashes down
Shattering to the ground
You'll, You'll feel all alone
When you don't know which way to go
And there's no such leading you on
You're not alone

The world comes to life
And everything's alright
From beginning to end
When you have a friend
By your side
That helps you find
The beauty of all when you'll open your heart
And believe in
When you can believe
You can believe in
                        
                    |
