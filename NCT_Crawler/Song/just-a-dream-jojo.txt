                        I paint my nails black ‘cause it fits my mood
I’m tired of looking around for something to prove
You don’t know How It feels inside my skin
But neither do I cause I know my feeling

Take it away, all of my pain
I got a bottle I gotta finish
Take it away, Take it from me
Cause if you don’t, I might drown in it

And I keep telling my telling my telling myself, that my bad luck’s gonna go away
And I keep trying and trying and trying tryna win but I/’m losing everyday
I wanna get up and fight but I don’t have the time, I’m too busy feeling sorry for me
When it looks like the clouds are gone, I wake up, It was just a dream, it was just a dream
It was just a dreeeeam , it was all a dream

Mmmhhhmmm

I walk around cold to the one that lie
Seein u tryna talk but im deaf to lies , right
I believe in promises of tomorrow
If I don’t make it then, know that im sorry though

Take it away, take it from me
Cause I really wanna believe
After the rain, someone will say that there really is more for me


And I keep telling my telling my telling myself, that my bad luck’s gonna go away
And I keep trying and trying and trying tryna win but Im losing everyday

See I’ve been through hell and I am still get to come back
There is no conduct to get this on track
I have dreams of freedom for the circumstance I’m in
If It's in his plans for me then I will win
Ill just dream till then

And I keep telling my telling my telling myself that my bad luck’s gonna go away
And I keep trying and trying and trying tryna win but I’m losing everyday
I wanna get up and fight but I don’t have the time, too busy feeling sorry for me
