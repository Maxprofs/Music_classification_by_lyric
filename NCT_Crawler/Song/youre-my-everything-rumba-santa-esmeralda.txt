                        Bài hát: You're My Everything (Rumba) - Santa Esmeralda

You're my everything
The sun that shines above you makes the bluebirds sing
The star that twinkle way up in the sky
Tell me i'm in love
When i kiss you're lips
I feel the rolling thunder to my finger tips
And all the while my head is in a spin
Deep within,i'm in love
You're my everything
And nothing really matters but the love you bring
You're my everything
To see you in the morning with those big brown eyes
You're my everything
Forever and a day i need you close to me
You're my everthing
You never have to worry never fear for i am near
When i hold you tight
There's nothing that can harm you in the lonely night
I'll come to you and keep you safe and warm
Yes, so strong my love
You're my everything and nothing
Really matters but the love you bring
You're my everything
To see you in the morning with those big brown eyes
You're my everything
Forever and the day
I need you close to me
You're my everything
You never have to worry never fear
For i am near
When i hold you tight
There's nothing that can harm you in the lonely night
I'll come to you and keep you safe and warm
Yes, so strong my love

When i kiss your lips
I feel the rolling thunder to my finger tips
And all the while my head is in a spin
Deep with in i'm in love
Uuuuuuuuuuuuuuu uuuuuuuuuuu... .........
