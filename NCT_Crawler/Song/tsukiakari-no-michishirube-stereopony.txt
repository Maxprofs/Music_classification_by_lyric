                        Bài hát: Tsukiakari No Michishirube - Stereopony

Kotae no nai mainichi ga
Tada sugite iku jikan ga
Kore kara saki dou naru no darou?
Wakaranai...

Yami yori mo fukai yoru no kodoku ni
Madowasareteta
Dareka ni ima kizuite hoshii...
Koko kara nigedashitai kara

Mado kara mieru asayake
Heya ni narihibiku oto
Araamu ni okosarete
Usugurai naka ie tobidasu yo
Kaban no naka ni wa
Nanimo kawaranai heibon tsumekonde
Soshite itsumo no basho e

Dareka ga itta kotoba ga
Ki ni natte madowasarete
Arasoitaku nante nai kara
Nanimo ienai
Yume ya risou wa aru keredo
Kimochi bakari saki ni itte
Genjitsu ga zutto ushiro kara
Boku wo miteru

Nee dareka oshiete
Minna sou na no kana?
Kyou ga shiawase nara
Sore de ii to omoeru tte
Osanai koro ni wa
Tashika ni atta yo
Yume wo oikaketeta
Demo sore mo tooi kioku

Kotae no nai mainichi ga
Tada sugite iku jikan ga
Kore kara saki dou naru no darou?
Wakaranai...
Tsukiakari no michishirube
Kumo wo koe boku ni todoke
Susumu beki michi wo terashite yo
Kyou ga donna ni kowaresou demo

Nani ga attemo
Nani ga attemo
Shinjitetai kara
Ano hi no tooi kioku yobisamasu kara
Wasurenaide ne mune ni kizamitsuke

Kotae wa jibun no naka ni
Kanarazu aru mono dakara
Akiramenaide
Tsuyoku ikiru koto wo yamenaide
Kanashisugite
Mae ni susumenai toki demo
Tomo ni nayami ayunda bokura ni
Kaze wa fuku
Doko made demo

The days go by with no answers
Time just keeps going by
What will happen in the future?
I don’t know...

I’ve been lost in the loneliness
Of these nights deeper than darkness
I want someone to notice now...
Because I want to get out of here

I can see the dawn from the window
A noise echoes through my room
I’m woken by my alarm
And rush out of the house in the *** morning light
I shove the same old ordinary things
Into my bag
And head for the usual place

Something someone said to me
Is getting to me, making me feel lost
I don’t want a fight
So I can’t say anything
I have dreams and ideals
But my feelings just keep taking over
Reality is watching me
From far behind

Please, someone tell me
Is it like this for everyone?
“If I’m happy today
Then that’s good enough for me”
I was definitely able to feel that way
When I was a child
I chased my dreams
But that’s a distant memory

The days go by with no answers
Time just keeps going by
What will happen in the future?
I don’t know...
Let the moonlight signpost
Shine through the clouds to me
And show me which road to take
No matter how close to breaking I am today

No matter what
No matter what
I want to believe
I’ll re-awaken the distant memory of that day
So don’t forget, keep it carved in your heart

The answer
Will always be inside you
So don’t give up
Don’t stop being strong in life
Even when you’re so sad
That you can’t go on
The wind will blow on us
Who worried and walked together
No matter where we go
                        
                    |
