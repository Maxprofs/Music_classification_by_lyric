Say say say, hey hey now baby
Oh mama, don't play now baby
Say say say, hey hey now baby
Said let's get one thing straight now baby

[Chorus:]
Tell me, tell me if you love me or not, love me or not, love me or not?
I'll bet the house on you, am I lucky or not, lucky or not, lucky or not?
You gotta tell me if you love me or not, love me or not, love me or not?
Been wishin' for you, am I lucky or not, lucky or not, lucky or not?

[Chorus:]
Tell me, tell me if you love me or not, love me or not, love me or not?
