                        I sit and wait
Does an angel contemplate my fate
And do they know the places where we go
When we're gray and old
'Cos I've been told that salvation lets their wings unfold
So when I'm lying in my bed
Thoughts running through my head and I feel that love is dead
I'm loving angels instead

Chorus :
And through it all she offers me protection
A lot of love and affection
whether I'm right or wrong
And down the waterfall
Wherever it may take me
I know that life wont break me
When I come to call she won't forsake me
I'm loving angels instead

When I'm feeling weak and my pain walks down a one way street
I look above and I know I'll always be blessed with love
And as the feeling grows
She breathes flesh to my bones
And when love is dead
I'm loving angels instead
                        
                    |
