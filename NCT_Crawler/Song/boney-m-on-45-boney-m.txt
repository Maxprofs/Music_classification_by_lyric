                        Bài hát : Boney M On 45 - Boney M.

1. She was the meanest cat
In old chicago town
She was the meanest cat
She really moved them down
She had no heart at all
No no no heart at all.

She was the meanest cat
Oh she was really tough
She left her husband flat
He wasnt tough enough
She took her boys along
cos they were mean and strong.

[Chorus:]
Ma ma ma ma - ma baker - she taught her four sons
Ma ma ma ma - ma baker - to handle their guns
Ma ma ma ma - ma baker - she never could cry
Ma ma ma ma - ma baker - but she knew how to die.

2. They left a trail of crime
Across the u.s.a.
And when one boy was killed
She really made them pay
She had no heart at all
No no no heart at all.

3. She met a man she liked
She thought shed stay with him
One day he formed with them
They did away with him
She didnt care at all
Just didnt care at all.

Here is a special bulletin
Ma baker is the fbis most wanted woman
Her photo is hanging on every post office wall
Ma Baker lyrics on ***
If you have any information about this woman
Please contact the nearest police station.

Dont anybody move! The money or your lives!

One day they robbed a bank
It was their last foray
The cops appeared too soon
They couldnt get away.

And all the loot they had
It made them mighty mad
And so they shot it out
Ma baker and her sons.

They didnt want to hang
They died with blazing guns
And so the story ends
Of one who left no friends.

[Chorus x2]
                        
                    |
