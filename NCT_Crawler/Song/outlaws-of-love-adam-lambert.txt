                        Bài hát: Outlaws Of Love - Adam Lambert

Oh, nowhere left to go.
Are we getting closer, closer?
No, all we know is no.
Nights are getting colder, colder.
Hey.
Tears all fall the same.
We all feel the rain
We can't change.
Everywhere we go
We're lookin' for the sun.
Nowhere to grow old.
We're always on the run.
They say we'll rot in hell
But i don't think we will
They've branded us enough
Outlaws of Love.
Scars make us who we are
Hearts and homes are broken, broken.
Far, we could go so far
With our minds wide open, open.
Hey
Tears all fall the same
We all feel the rain
We can't change.
Everywhere we go
We're lookin' for the sun.
Nowhere to grow old.
We're always on the run.
They say we'll rot in hell
But i don't think we will
They've branded us enough
Outlaws of Love.
Outlaws of Love.
Outlaws of Love.
Outlaws of Love
Outlaws of Love
