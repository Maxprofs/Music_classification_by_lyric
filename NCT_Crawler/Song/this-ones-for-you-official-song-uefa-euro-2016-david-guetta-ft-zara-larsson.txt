                        Bài hát: This One's For You (Official Song UEFA Euro 2016) 
- David Guetta, Zara Larsson

We're born to fly
So let's keep living till it all falls down
Let's close our eyes
and let the moment drown the whole world out

We're in this together
Hear our hearts beat together
We stand strong together
We're in this forever
This one's for you
This one's for you... yeah yeah hey

Waving colored flags
We won't surrender there's no standing down
no standing down
Love's a playing field oh no
It's full of winners we're breaking new ground

We're in this together
Hear our hearts beat together
We stand strong together
We're in this forever forever
This one's for you
This one's for you... ooh yeah yeah yeah

In this together
Whoa whoa whoa whoa
Uh

We're in this together we're in this together
Hear our hearts beat together
We stand strong together
We're in this forever ooh whoa yeah

This one's for you
