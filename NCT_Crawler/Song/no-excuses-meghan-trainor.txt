                        Bài hát: No Excuses - Meghan Trainor

[Intro]
Woo!
Huh!

[Verse 1]
What you sippin' on that got you talking crazy?
Lookin' at me sideways, always coming at me
Why you, why you acting hard when you just a baby?
Boy, I keep it real with you, but you trying to play me

[Pre-Chorus]
Have you lost your mind?
Open up your eyes
Huh!

[Chorus]
Someone else
You must've confused me, confused me with
Someone else
You must've confused me, confused me with
Someone else
There ain't no excuses, excuses, babe
Someone else
Your mama raised you better than that, huh!

[Verse 2]
What you sippin' on that got you talking crazy? (Hey!)
Lookin' at me sideways (Woo!), always coming at me
Why you, why you acting like you never met a lady?
I don't disrespect you, don't you disrespect me

[Pre-Chorus]
Have you lost your mind? (lost your mind)
Open up your eyes
Huh!

[Chorus]
Someone else
You must've confused me, confused me with
Someone else
You must've confused me, confused me with
Someone else
There ain't no excuses, excuses, babe
Someone else
Your mama raised you better than that, huh!

[Post-Chorus]
Your mama raised you better than that (that's right)
Cause Your mama raised you better than that

[Bridge]
Have you lost your mind?
Open up your eyes (your eyes)
Huh!

[Chorus]
Someone else
You must've confused me, confused me with (confused me with)
Someone else
You must've confused me, confused me with
Someone else
There ain't no excuses, excuses, babe (no excuses, no, no)
Someone else
Your mama raised you better than that, huh! (how she raise you?)

[Outro]
You must've confused me (Hey! Come on), confused me with
Your mama raised you better than, better than that
There ain't no excuses, excuses, babe
Your mama raised you better than that, huh!
(she raised you better than that)
