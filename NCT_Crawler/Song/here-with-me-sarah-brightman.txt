Title: Here with me

/ Pascal Gabriel

I didn't hear you leave
I wonder how am I still here
I don't want to move a thing
It might change my memory

Oh I am what I am
I'll do what I want
But I can't hide

I won't go
I won't sleep
I can't breathe
Until you're resting
Here with me
I won't leave
I can't hide
I cannot be
Until you're resting
Here with me

I don't want to call my friends
They might wake me from this dream
And I don't wanna leave this bed
Risk forgetting all that's been

Oh I am what I am
I'll do what I want
But I can't hide

I won't go
I won't sleep
I can't breathe
Until you're resting
Here with me
I won't leave
I can't hide
I cannot be
Until you're resting
Here with me

I won't go
I won't sleep
I can't breathe
Until you're resting
Here with me
I won't leave
I can't hide
I cannot be
Until you're resting
Here with me

Oh I am what I am
I'll do what I want
But I can't hide

I won't go
I won't sleep
I can't breathe
Until you're resting
Here with me
I won't leave
I can't hide
I cannot be
Until you're resting
Here with me

I won't go
I won't sleep
I can't breathe
Until you're resting
Here with me
I won't leave
I can't hide
I cannot be
Until you're resting
Here with me

Oh-oh-oh ...
