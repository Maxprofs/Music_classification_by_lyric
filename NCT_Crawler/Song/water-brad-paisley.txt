                        Song: Water - Brad Paisley

Inflatable pool full of dad's hot air 
I was three years old 
Splashin' everywhere 
And so began my love affair 
With water 

On a river bank 
With all my friends 
A big old rope tied to a limb 
And your a big old wuss 
If you don't jump in 
The water 

Yeah when that summer sun starts to beatin' down 
And you don't know what to do 
Grab your swimming trunks 
Ice up that old igloo 
Drive until the map turns blue 

Daytona Beach on spring break 
Eighteen girls up on stage 
White t-shirts about to be sprayed 
With water 

Oh let'er go boys 

Yeah when that summer sun starts to beatin' down 
And you don't know what to do 
Just go and grab someone you wanna see in a bathing suit 
And drive until the map turns blue 

You can stay right there 
When the daylights gone 
Play truth or dare 
And it wont take long 
'Fore you and her got nothin' on 
But water 

All you really need this time of year 
Is a pair of shades 
And ice cold beer 
And a place to sit somewhere near 
Water
                        
                    |
