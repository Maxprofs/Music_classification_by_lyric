 Yeah, once again it's on
 Em, Stat now alive and this mother***er on
 The ho's get naked soon as the song comes on
 The niggas get reckless it's off the chain it's on

 It's papa speakers knockin' crowds off the floor
 They jockin' and watchin' when I walks through the door
 It's him tell a friend but you already know
 Act stupid and lose it don't *** with Quo

 I'm kind of different heed not the usual
 Sippin' cognac between two beautiful
 Two bitches at the club talk *** at your funeral
 I came to get a buzz and crunk understand yo

 It's crowded in back, he's jumpin', *** it's slow
 I'm cooler than cool 'cause my temperature is thirty below
 I'm checkin' the scene for new c*** doppin' it low
 Shakin' they ass, backin' it up, fast or slow

 You know this thing don't stop till I say so
 Now get low, get low, keep that ass on the floor
 You know this club don't close till I say so
 Now get low, get low, keep that ass on the flow

 Yeah now get low, get low, keep that ass on the floor
 Get low, get low, keep that ass on the floor
 Yeah now get low, get low, keep that ass on the floor
 Get low, get low, keep that ass on the floor, yeah

 At the bar lookin' sober but I'm high as ***
 And as far as y'all who be actin' tough
 I'm in the spot with the glock please believe it's tough

 We ready we sweaty, it's hot, it's off the chain
 We macin' and spewin' please Miss tell me what's ya name
 The way you move and them jeans made me happy you came
 I'm tryin' to get to know ya possibly get some brain

 I need pinky rings I'm the man of your dreams
 Your life if you wanna be wifey and join my team
 So I can support you and support you by any means
 Nah, I ain't givin' you none of my things

 But we can leave the club tonight, hit the telly and ***
 Long as you know when I bust I'm in the dust
 Ain't no children, it ain't nothing nothing for us to discuss
 Except what time your ride pickin' you up

 You know this thing don't stop till I say so
 Now get low, get low, keep that ass on the floor
 You know this club don't close till I say so
