                        I can fly in my mind
 To a place peaceful and
 Full of grace come with me
 You will see love is there To make us whole again
 A love that only love knows Go where love goes
 Go where your heart leads
 Angels are pleading with you
 Go there, go where love dares Gather me in your arms
 Hold me close like Lazarus
 To rise again like a bird
 To fly again in flowers dreams So love can feed your soul
 Love will make you whole, so Go where love goes
 Go where your heart leads
 Angels are pleading with you
 Go there, go where love dares to go Love makes the rainbow
 Love is the dawns glow
 Love makes the rose grow
 Reaching for Heaven so Go where love goes
 Go where your heart leads
 Angels are pleading with you
 Go there, go where love dares Dream how love dreams
 Love feeds the dreamers
 Angels are calling you to go there
 Go where love dares, go
                        
                    |
