                        I know that You could easily
Take away every thing You’ve given me
And I try to remember
Not to take anything for granted
‘Cause I know that one day
Suddenly this will all come to an end
So my last wish is for you to be pleased with Me

Allah, Ya Allah
Guide me all the way to your Jannah
Ya Allah, Ya Allah
Don’t let me go astray ’cause I need you
By my side, I wish to be close
Close to You throughout my life
Ya Allah, oh Allah!
Be with me all the way

I know that sometime I do
I do forget that my next breath could be the last
Forgive me ’cause I cant thank you enough
Forgive me when I doubt your love
Now I pray for that day
when all this stops and comes to an end
So my last wish is for You to be pleased with me

Allah, Ya Allah
Guide me all the way to your Jannah
Ya Allah, Ya Allah
Don’t let me go astray ’cause I need you
By my side, I wish to be close
Close to You throughout my life
Ya Allah, oh Allah!
Be with me all the way

Day by day passes
And I think that my time could be near
So I pray: O God let this world be in my hands
And not in my heart
‘Cause soon I’ll have to leave it [x2]

Allah, Ya Allah
Guide me all the way to your Jannah
Ya Allah, Ya Allah
Don’t let me go astray ’cause I need you
By my side, I wish to be close
Close to You throughout my life
Ya Allah, oh Allah!
Be with me all the way
[x2]

Guide me all the way
Don’t let me go astray
                        
                    |
