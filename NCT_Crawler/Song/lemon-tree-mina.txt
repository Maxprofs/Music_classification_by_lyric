                        I'm sitting here in the boring room
it's just another rainy sunday afternoon
i'm waiting my time
i got nothing to do
i'm hanging around
i'm waitng for you
but nothing ever happens
and i wonder
i'm driving around in my car
i'm driving too fast
i'm driving too far
i'd like to change my point of view

i feel so lonely
i'm waitng for you
but nothing ever happens
and i wonder
i wonder how
i wonder why
yesterday you told me 'bout the blue blue sky
and all that i can see is just a yellow Lemon-tree
i'm turning my head
up and down
i'm turning turning turning turning turning around
and all that i can see
is just another yellow Lemon-tree
say: da
da da da da di da da
da da da da di da da
da di da di da

I'm sitting here
i miss the power
i'd like to go out
taking a shower
but there's a havey cloud inside my head
i feel so tired
put my self into bed
well's nothing ever happens
and i wonder
isolation not good for me
isolation
i don't want to sit on the lemon-tree
i'm steppin around in the desert of joy
baby anyhow
i'll get another toy
and everything happen
and you wonder
i wonder how
i wonder why
yesterday you told me 'bout the blue blue sky
and all that i can see
i just another lemon-tree
'm turning my head up and down
i'm turning turning turning turning turning around
and all that i can see
is just another yellow Lemon-tree
and i wonder, wonder
i wonder how
i wonder why
yesterday you told me 'bout the blue blue sky
and all that i can see
and all that i can see
and all that i can see
is just another yellow Lemon-tree
