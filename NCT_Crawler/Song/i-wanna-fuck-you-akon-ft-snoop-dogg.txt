Shorty I can see u aint lonely handful of niggas n they all got G's, 
so u lookin at me now whats it gonna be just another tease far as I can see,

throwin bout 30 stacks in the back make it rain like that cuz I'm far from a scrub,

girl I spend money like it dont mean nothin and besides I got a thing for u.
