Rock|

                        The faint blaze of the candle
 Of my life slowly dying
 Like a fire in the pouring rain.
 No sparks of hope inside,
 No shooting stars on my sky.
 On broken wings, no flying high.
 Another night, another demise,
 Cadaverous wind blowing cold as ice.
 I'll let the wind blow out the light,
 'Cuz it gets more painful Every Time I die.
 Out of strength to fight,
 I cannot take another night.
 I cannot take it no more,
 Lust of light slips through my fingers.
 Like blood drips off my arms,
 Black candle wax has buried me.
 Another night, another demise,
 Cadaverous wind blowing cold as ice,
 I'll let the wind blow out the light,
 'Cuz it gets more painful everytime I die.
