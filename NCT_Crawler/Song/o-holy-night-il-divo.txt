                        Bài hát: O Holy Night - Il Divo

[Urs:]
O holy night! The stars are brightly shining,
It is the night of the dear Saviour's birth.

[David:]
Long lay the world in sin and error pining.
Till He appeared and the soul felt its worth.

[Carlos:]
A thrill of hope, the weary soul rejoices,
For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn.

[Sebastien:]
Fall on your knees! Oh, hear the angel voices!
O night divine, oh night when Christ was born;

[Urs:]
O night divine, oh night oh night divine.

O holy night! The stars are brightly shining,
It is the night of the dear Saviour's birth.

[Carlos:]
Sweet hymns of joy in grateful chorus raise we,

[Sebastien:]
Let all within us praise His holy name.

Christ is the Lord,
Let everyone in grateful chorus raise we
O night, o night
O night, o night divine
O night, divine, o night
O holy night.
                        
                    |
