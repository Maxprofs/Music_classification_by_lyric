Il Divo - O Holy Night

O holy night! The stars are brightly shining,
It is the night of the dear Saviour's birth.

Long lay the world in sin and error pining.
Till He appeared and the soul felt its worth.

A thrill of hope, the weary soul rejoices,
For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn.

Fall on your knees! Oh, hear the angel voices!
O night divine, oh night when Christ was born;

O night divine, oh night oh night divine.
O holy night! The stars are brightly shining,
It is the night of the dear Saviour's birth.

Sweet hymns of joy in grateful chorus raise we,
Let all within us praise His holy name.

Christ is the Lord, Let ever ever praise
Thee Noel, Noel
O night, o night divine
O night, divine, o night
O holy night.
