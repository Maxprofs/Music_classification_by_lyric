                        Bài hát: The Fall - Imagine Dragons

Maybe I'm broken, maybe I'm wrong
I could've spoken sooner than I should've
Only the good die old
That's what they told me, but I don't know
Maybe I'm breaking up with myself
Maybe I'm thinking I should just keep to
The things that I've been told
Wait for the colors to turn to gold

Do you know? Do you know?
You're not alone, you're not alone
That everything is crashing down
You're not alone, you're not alone

I'm ready for the fall
I'm ready for everything
That I believed in to drift away
Ready for the leaves
Ready for the colors to burn to gold and crumble away

Maybe I'm dusting to be destroyed
Always a reason breaking me
After my meets in the dead of night
I keep on praying to see the light
Maybe I'm breaking up with myself
Maybe I'm thinking I should just keep to
The things that I've been told
Wait for the colors to turn to gold

Do you know? Do you know?
You're not alone, you're not alone
That everything is crashing down
You're not alone, you're not alone

I'm ready for the fall
I'm ready for everything
That I believed in to drift away
Ready for the leaves
Ready for the colors to burn to gold and crumble away

[Outro]
I'm ready for the fall
Ready for the leaves
Ready for the colors to burn to gold and crumble away
                        
                    |
