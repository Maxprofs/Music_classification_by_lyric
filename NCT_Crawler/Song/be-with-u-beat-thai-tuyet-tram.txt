                        Bài hát: Be With U - Thái Tuyết Trâm

Rain falls on my shoulder 
You bring the sun that makes my life shine brighter everyday 
If the rain wanna falls forever in my eyes 
I know you will be there to wipe my tears 
wind blows away my sadness 
I see you're standing right in front of me and paint my happiness 
If there is gonna be another wound in my heart 
I know you will be the one to stay beside me 

Chorus : 
I wanna stay with you like this 
In this moment just this is 
To be with you from now until the day I die 
If tomorrow is goodbye 
So I will try to stop the time 
To love you and forever be with you 
Day by day gone so fast 
Seems like the day we've had is over 
Now it's the time to say goodbye 
I'll leave all my love forever in your heart 
Because I know someday , love will bring us back again 

Chorus : 
I wanna stay with you like this 
In this moment just this is 
To be with you from now until the day I die 
If tomorrow is goodbye 
So I will try to stop the time 
To love you and forever be with you .
