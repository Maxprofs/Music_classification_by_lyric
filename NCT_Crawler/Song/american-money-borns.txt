                        Bài hát: American Money - BORNS

I was there when you fell from the clouds
And landed in the desert
There was a thunder inside of my heart
There was a wonderful pleasure

And like a stallion raised in the rain
You rode on the back of my bike
I knew from the song that you sang
That you were my lover for life

Oh, there's no time to sleep
Oh, living in a dream

So take me to the paradise
In your eyes
Green like American money
You taste just right
Sweet like Tennessee honey

And we can run away
Swimming in the sunlight everyday
Oh, paradise in your eyes
Green like American money

So we took to the calico road
Running from the weather
There was a highway inside of her eyes
There was a buried treasure

And we got caught in the storm
You started flying the kite
At the end was the key to my heart
You were my lover for life

Oh, there's no time to sleep
Oh, living in a dream

So take me to the paradise
In your eyes
Green like American money
You taste just right
Sweet like Tennessee honey

And we can run away
Swimming in the sunlight everyday
Oh, paradise in your eyes
Green like American money

We carved our love in the mountainside
We soaked our hearts in the rain
And I, waited my whole life, for you

So take me to the paradise
In your eyes
Green like American money
You taste just right
Sweet like Tennessee honey

And we can run away
Swimming in the sunlight everyday
Oh, paradise in your eyes
Green like American money.
