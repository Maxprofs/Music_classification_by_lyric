                        Bài hát: I Love You - Axwell & Ingrosso, Kid Ink

[Chorus]
I love you
Even though I don't like you right now
I want you
Even though you keep breaking me down
We got
Really high highs
Really low lows
But I still love you
Even though I don't like you right now

[Verse 1]
I was tryna save us
But you got me looking like the villain
I had a couple mixed drinks
Now I got a couple mixed feelings
I love it, I love it
You know just how to fit in that dress
Then, I don't like it, I don't like it
Wish they had a button for your Instagram pic
We argue about this and that when
You say you need a different address
Break up to make up
Hit the mattress
Wake up and you don't remember half of
The whole lotta games that we played
I ain't afraid to say when I'm wrong
You ain't afraid to dance how you owe me a favor
As long as I

[Chorus]
I love you
Even though I don't like you right now
I want you
Even though you keep breaking me down
We got
Really high highs
Really low lows
But I still love you
Even though I don't like you right now

I love you (I love you, I love you)
I want you (I want you, I want you)
I love you (I love you, I love you)
I want you (I want you, I want you)
Even though I don't like you right now

[Verse 2]
You ain't gotta say nothin', you ain't gotta say nothin'
Already know why you trippin'
And I had nothin' to do with them bitches
So you ain't gotta say nothin'
Six inch heel when she bust in
*** is in my face when she rushed in
Throwin' purses, make-up and brushes

[Pre-Chorus]
I can't keep it aside
Loving with caution, rushing
No I can't see you tonight
But 2AM I might be calling, calling
'Cause I

[Chorus]
I love you
Even though I don't like you right now
I want you
Even though you keep breaking me down
We got
Really high highs
Really low lows
But I still love you
Even though I don't like you right now

I don't like you no
I, I, I don't like you no, I

I love you
I want you
I don't like you
I love you
I want you

[Outro]
I love you
Even though I don't like you right now
I want you
Even though you keep breaking me down
Way down
Really high highs
Really low lows
But I still love you
Even though I don't like you right now
