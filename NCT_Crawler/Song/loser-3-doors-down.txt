Rock|

                        Breathe in right away.
Nothing seems to fill this place.
I need this everytime
So take your lies, get off my case.
Someday I will find
A love that flows through me like this
This will fall away, this will fall away.

[Chorus]
You're getting closer 
To pushing me off of life's little edge
'Cause I'm a loser
And sooner or later you know I'll be dead
You're getting closer
You're holding the rope and I'm taking the fall
'Cause I'm a loser, I'm a loser, yeah.

This is getting old.
I can't break these chains that I hold
My body's growing cold
There's nothing left of this mind or my soul.
Addiction needs a pacifier, the buzz of this poison is taking me higher.
This will fall away, this will fall away.
                        
                    |
