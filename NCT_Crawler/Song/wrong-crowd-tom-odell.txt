                        Bài hát: Wrong Crowd - Tom Odell

And my mother is standing beside me
As I'm packing my bags in the car
She says please boy no more fighting
Oh it's only gonna do your harm

But I can't help it I don't know how
I guess I'll always be hanging round with the wrong crowd
I can't help it I don't know how
I guess I'll always be hanging round with the wrong crowd

Ohhhh My boy

And my brother is standing behind me
As I'm slowly going out my head
He says you know those people don't like me
Why do you wanna be one of them

But I can't help it I don't know how
I guess I'll always be hanging round with the wrong crowd
I can't help it I don't know how
I guess I'll always be hanging round with the wrong crowd

Ohhhh I wish I could find somebody that my mother would like
Ohhhh I wish I can find somebody that could treat me right

But I can't help it I don't know how
I guess I'll always be hanging round with the wrong crowd
I can't help it I don't know how
I guess I'll always be hanging round with the wrong crowd

But I can't help it I don't know how
I guess I'll always be hanging round with the wrong crowd
I can't help it I don't know how
I guess I'll always be hanging round with the wrong crowd

But I can't help it I don't know how
I guess I'll always be hanging round with the wrong crowd
I can't help it I don't know how
I guess I'll always be hanging round with the wrong crowd

But I can't help it I don't know how
I guess I'll always be hanging round with the wrong crowd
I can't help it I don't know how
I guess I'll always be hanging round with the wrong crowd
