                        Bài hát: Em Ơi (English Version) - Lynk Lee

Babe, everytime 
When we get close 
Just next to me 
You keep asking why 
It's been so long 
It's never wrong 
To become strong 
Stay where you belong 
My girl, please come to me 
Hold my hands, don't let go 
And I will tell you 
My dear, all my life I want 
To be by your side and walk like you've always wished 
To be near you even in my dreams 
So just come with me, forget your worries 
In this place, there's only you and me 
I'll sing a song for you, while you smile and see 
A simple love is not so bad at all 
And I would like to be everything for you and I 
Will not leave you alone 
Don't care for others, I still love you 
All the time that we've been together, I know you are my life 
Time has slowly passed, and my heart keeps running fast 
I'm not the dudes you always like in those manga 
Because what I bring, my love for you is still better so far 
L.O.V.E 
You and I, so many good things 
L.O.V.E 
I would give to you 
Look at the stars above 
They know that my words are true 
So, sweety, believe me 
And say that we will never have to part ways
                        
                    |
