                        Bài hát: Can't Believe It (Jack Mazzoni, Christopher Vitale Edit) - Flo Rida, Pitbull

I can't believe it
White girl got some ass
I wanna see it
Black girl got a ass
It ain't a secret
Baby turn around
I wanna see it, tryin' to see it, gotta see it
I wanna see that bubble yum bum, badum bum badum
Bubble yum bum, badum bum badum

Uh, I think I found one 'cause I got that fever of Britney
Gotta self around one, ass like Serena, that's okay
'Cause I love my stereotypes, my girls in twos
That maximum exposure rolls and know what I wanna do,
Telling all the girls, all around the world, my last name must be Robins
'Cause I'm basking in these asses, all thirty-one flavors keep calling,
My my my my vanilla Cinderella love when I tell her drop it,
A butt of pecan recan but I, I love my chocolate.

I can't believe it
White girl got some ass
I wanna see it
Black girl got a ass
It ain't a secret
Baby turn around
I wanna see it, tryin' to see it, gotta see it
I wanna see that bubble yum bum, badum bum badum
Bubble yum bum, badum bum badum
Bubble yum bum, badum bum badum
Bubble yum bum, badum bum badum

[Pitbull]
She got that ba-donka donka donk donkie
Thing so fat, thing so chunky,
Call me Michael Jackson, hee hee
'Cause I love to play with monkeys,
This the Miami thing, that's right
We down for anything that's right,
You do everything, that's right
Flo Rida, Pitbull anything,
I'm off the chain a lang a lang lang,
Ustedes saben quien es quien
Mira salinga con toda esa nalga de [?]
Como tu sabes estoy loco.
Pero que bueno que era poco,
Mami mueve los coco,
I don't care where you're from
As long as you got that bubble bum

I can't believe it (I can't believe it)
White girl got some ass
I wanna see it
Black girl got a ass
It ain't a secret
Baby turn around
I wanna see it, tryin' to see it, gotta see it
I wanna see that bubble yum bum, badum bum badum
Bubble yum bum, badum bum badum
Bubble yum bum, badum bum badum
Bubble yum bum, badum bum badum

Now turn left, turn right
Turn around you could tell what I like
She look good, she so bad
She kick it up, drop it down, look back.

Bubble yum bum, badum bum badum
Bubble yum bum, badum bum badum
Bubble yum bum, badum bum badum
Bubble yum bum, badum bam badum

I can't believe it
White girl got a dance
I wanna see it, badum bum badum.
I can't believe it
White girl got a dance
I wanna see it, badum bum badum.

I can't believe it
White girl got a dance
I wanna see it, badum bum badum.
I can't believe it
White girl got a dance
I wanna see it, badum bum badum.
