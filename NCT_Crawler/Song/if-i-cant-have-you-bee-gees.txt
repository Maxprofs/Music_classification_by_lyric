Bee Gees Fans!
To My Lover, 
Don't know why I'm surviving every lonely day
When there's got to be no chance for me
My life would end and it just don't matter how I cry
My tears of love a waste of time if I turn away
Am I strong enough to see it through?
Go crazy is what I will do
If I can't have you, I don't want nobody baby
If I can't have you, ah hah hah ah
If I can't have you, I don't want nobody baby
If I can't have you, ah hah hah ah
Can't let go and it doesn't matter how I try
I gave it all so easily to you my love
To dreams that never will come true
Am I strong enough to see it through?
Go crazy is what I will do
If I can't have you, I don't want nobody baby
If I can't have you, ah hah hah ah
If I can't have you, I don't want nobody baby
If I can't have you, ah hah hah ah
If I can't have you, I don't want nobody baby
If I can't have you, ah hah hah ah
If I can't have you, I don't want nobody baby
If I can't have you, ah hah hah ah
If I can't have you, I don't want nobody baby
If I can't have you, ah hah hah ah
If I can't have you, I don't want nobody baby
If I can't have you, ah hah hah ah
