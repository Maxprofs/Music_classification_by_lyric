we live on a mountain
right at the top
there's a beautiful view
from the top of the mountain
every morning I walk
towards the edge
and throw little things off
like: car-parts, bottles and cutlery
or whatever I find lying around
it's become a habit a way
to start the day
I go through all this
before you wake up
so I can feel happier
to be safe up here with you

it's real early morning
no-one is awake
I'm back at my cliff
still throwing things off
I listen to the sounds they make
on their way down
I follow with my eyes 'til they crash
imagine what my body would sound like
slamming against those rocks
and when it lands
will my eyes be closed or open?
