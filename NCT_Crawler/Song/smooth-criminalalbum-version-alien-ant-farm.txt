                        As he came into the window
 Was a sound of a crescendo

 He came into her apartment
 He left the bloodstains
 On the carpet

 She was sitting at the table
 He could see she was unable

 So she ran into the bedroom
 She was struck down
 It was her doom

 Annie, Are you OK?
 You OK
 You OK, Annie?

 Annie, Are you OK?
 You OK
 You OK, Annie?

 Annie, Are you OK?
 You OK
 You OK, Annie?

 Annie, Are you OK?
 You OK
 You OK, Annie?

 Annie, Are you OK?
 Would you tell us that you're OK
 There's a sign at the window
 That he struck you
 A crescendo, Annie
 He came into your apartment
 He left the bloodstains
 On the carpet
 Then you ran into the bedroom
 You were struck down
 It was your doom

 Annie, Are you OK?
 You OK
 You OK, Annie?

 Annie, Are you OK?
 You OK
 You OK, Annie?

 Annie, Are you OK?
 You OK
 You OK, Annie?
 You've been hit by
 You've been struck by
 A smooth criminal

 So they came into the outway
 It was Sunday
 What a black day
 I could feel your salutation
 Sounding heartbeats
 Intimidations

 Annie, Are you OK?
 You OK
 You OK, Annie?

 Annie, Are you OK?
 You OK
 You OK, Annie?

 Annie, Are you OK?
 You OK
 You OK, Annie?

 Annie, Are you OK?
 You OK
 You OK, Annie?

 Annie, Are you OK?
 Would you tell us that you're OK
 There's a sign at the window
 That he struck you
 A crescendo, Annie
 He came into your apartment
 He left the bloodstains on the carpet
 Then you ran into the bedroom
 You were struck down
 It was your doom

 Annie, Are you OK?
 You OK
 You OK, Annie?
 You've been hit by
 You've been struck by
 A smooth criminal

 Annie, Are you OK?
 Would you tell us that you're OK
 There's a sign at the window
 That he struck you
 A crescendo, Annie
 He came into your apartment
 He left the bloodstains
 On the carpet
 Then you ran into the bedroom
 You were struck down
 It was your doom

 Annie, Are you OK?
 You OK
 You OK, Annie?

 Annie, Are you OK?
 You OK
 You OK, Annie?

 Annie, Are you OK?
 You OK
 You OK, Annie?

 Annie, Are you OK?
 You OK
 You OK, Annie?
