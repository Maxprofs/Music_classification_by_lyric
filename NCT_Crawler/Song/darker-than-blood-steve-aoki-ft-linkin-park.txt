                        Bài hát: Darker Than Blood - Steve Aoki, Linkin Park

Cause I'm not coming down
The battlefields have left me only scars
I'm floating in the dark
I'm swimming in the sound
Of voices that should never been apart

[Chorus]
Darker than the blood
Higher than the sun
This is not the end
You are not the only one

[Verse 2]
Venom on their tongues
They'll paint it on the walls
Justice doesn't have the strength to hold
The higher than they climb
The harder they will fall
And we will break their bones until they fold

[Chorus]

[Outro]
This is not the end
(You are not the only one)
You are not the only one
(Higher than the sun)
(This is not the end)
This is not the end
(You are not the only one)
You are not the only one
