                        Mama, when my dollies have babies
 And I am a big lady
 Mama, will a prince come and take me away? When I said these things, I believed in kings
 Then I didn't know love could hurt me so
 Slowly she replied, tears had filled her eyes
 Baby, not so fast, let your young life last Mama, when my dollies have babies
 And I am a big lady
 Mama, will a prince come and take me away? I sang to her in fun, my teens had just began
 My age was not the same, still we played this game
 Her eyes were filled with pride, slowly she replied
 Soon enough you'll be a very pretty bride Mama, when my dollies have babies
 And I am a big lady
 Mama, will the hurt go away deep inside When I sang this song, my poor world had gone along
 All my early dreams has turned to crystal streams
 My love, it last and more tears have past
 And left me just one thing, a tender voice that sing Mama, when my dollies have babies
 And I am a big lady
 Mama
