                        Bài hát: I Don'T Wanna Know(Main) - Mario Winans, Enya, P. Diddy

Just can't believe it's true
It's just another night of these thoughts
Can't get this out of my head, yeah

Somebody said they saw you
The person you were kissing wasn't me
And I would never ask you
I just kept it to myself

I don't wanna know
If you're playin' me keep it on the low
'Cause my heart can't take it anymore
And if you're creepin' please don't let it show
Oh baby, I don't wanna know
Oh, oh baby

I think about it when I hold you
When lookin' in your eyes, I can't believe
I don't mean to know the truth
Baby, keep it to yourself

I don't wanna know
If you're playin' me keep it on the low
'Cause my heart can't take it anymore
And if you're creepin' please don't let it show
Oh baby, I don't wanna know

Did he touch you better than me
Did he watch you fall asleep
Did you show him all those things
That you used to do to me

If you're better off that way
Baby all that I can say
Just go on and do your thing
And don't come back to me

I don't need to know your whereabouts or how you're movin'
I know when you in the house or when you're cruisin'
It's been proven my love you abusin'
And I can't understand how a man got you choosin'

Undecided, I came and provided
My undivided, you came and denied it
Don't even try it, I know when you lyin'
Don't even do that, I know why you cryin'

I'm not applyin' no pressure, just wanna let you know
That I don't wanna let you go
And I don't wanna let you leave
Can't say I didn't let you breathe, gave you extra G's

Put you in the SUV
You wanted ice, so I made you freeze
Made you hot like the West Indies
Now it's time you invest in me
'Cause if not then it's best you leave, holla

I don't wanna know
If you're playin' me keep it on the low
'Cause my heart can't take it anymore
And if you're creepin' please don't let it show
Oh baby, I don't wanna know

If you're playin' me keep it on the low
'Cause my heart can't take it anymore
And if you're creepin' please don't let it show
Oh baby, I don't wanna know

If you're playin' me keep it on the low
'Cause my heart can't take it anymore
And if you're creepin' please don't let it show
Oh baby, I don't wanna know
