Verse 1:

I cant carry the weight around baby
How could I have every belonged
Learning all my lessons
Dangerous impressions
Pushed you right out of my world
I know that you and I have tried very hard to find a different result
But how could we be patient, when were always racing
And no one's ever there to hold

Anytime you need you a friend baby
I will be the one that you want
And if you ever down and out baby
I will be there biggin' you up
And you can lean on me anytime baby
For anything you want and need
Oh I don't need a reason
Memory or a season
Its longer than always could be
and furher than the eyes can see

Chorus:
Forever love
Oh forever love
Forever mine, forever yours
Forever love
Forever love
Oh it's forever love
Forever mine, forever yours
Forever love, Forever love

Verse 2:
Impossible, impossible
Its possible, anything's possible

So come on over baby start the healing
Let me get a good look at you
Cause i miss our discussion
Whispering and blushing
Secrets that only we know

Any time you need a friend baby
I can be the one that you want
And if you're ever down and out baby
I can be the one that you want
You can lean on me anytime baby
For anything you want and need
Oh I don't need a reason
Memory or a season
Everyday I will believe
That you and I were meant to be

Chorus:
Forever love
Oh forever love
Forever mine, forever yours
Forever love
Forever love
Oh it's forever love
Forever mine, forever yours
Forever love

Verse 3:
When you're broken
Where you're blind
And you need someone to show you the light
I'll be right there baby
Holding you tight
Cause if you ever need a friend baby
I can be the one that you want

And if you're ever down and out baby
I can be the one that you want
You can lean on me anytime baby
For anything you want and need
Oh I don't need a reason
Memory or a season
Everyday I will believe
It's longer than always could be
Oh it's further than the eyes can see
More real than any dream could be
Oh you and I, you and I
You and I we were family

Forever love
Oh forever love
Forever mine, forever yours
Forever love
Forever love
Oh it's forever love
Forever mine, forever yours
Forever love
