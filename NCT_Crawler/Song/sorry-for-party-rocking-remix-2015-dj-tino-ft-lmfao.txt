                        Bài hát: Sorry For Party Rocking (Remix 2015) - Dj Tino, LMFAO

I be up in the party, looking for a hottie to bone
I gotta drink in my hand, and they just called Buffalo
Popping bottles in the house with models in the V-I-P
All the girls make out for the whole damn club to see

(Let's go!) People always say that my music's loud, sorry for party rocking!
Neighbors complain, sayin' turn it down, sorry for party rocking!
Haters don't like me, 'cause I'm the spotlight, sorry for party rocking!
When they talk s***, we just be like, sorry for party rocking!

Baby baby baby, I'm awfully crazy
Off Ciroc, off Patron, s*** whatever's tasty
We don't got no manners, hangin' off the rafters
Let's go drink for drink, a hundred bucks she on that latest
Check my style, take a good look, I'm fresh b****
In my whip with the music so loud I'm deaf b****
Gettin' brains at a red light with people watchin', sorry for party rocking!
If you show up already tow up this is what you say, sorry for party rocking
And if you blacked out with your sack out
This is what you say, sorry for party rocking
And if you throw up in a hoes cup
This is what you say, sorry for party rocking
And if she has a hissy fit cause you whiskey dick
This is what you say, sorry for party rocking, oh

I don't give a f*** when I'm in the club
Sippin' buzz really drunk and I see a fat booty
Got to have it I'm a grab it 'cause it's a habit automatic like Uzi,
Uzi with the sick flow make a chick go crazy and plastered
Tatta it's Redfoo the dude a true party rocka'

I'm true to the game too
It's called beer pong and I can't loose
I got some bad b****es in the back
With Ciroc on tap and a bit of little of Gray Goose ooh
Oh yeah we kill this s***
With our money we diligent
So here is a sorry in advance no hard feelings b****, sorry for party rocking

People always say that my musics loud
Sorry for party rocking, neighbors complain saying turn it down!
Sorry for party rocking, haters don't like we got the spotlight
Sorry for party rocking, when they talk s***, we just be like
Sorry for party rocking
