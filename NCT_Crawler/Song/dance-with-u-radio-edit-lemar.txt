                        Dance dance dance
 Dance dance dance
 Makes me wanna dance

 When I saw you girl I knew
 That you were something out of a story book
 And I told me heart that we gotta take one look
 I imagine both me and you
 Doing what lovers do
 Holding hands in the park
 Making love girl after dark

 (The ooh the ahh the ooh)
 The sounds of the birds and the bees
 Bringing you to your knees
 Is all I wanna do yeah

 [Chorus:]
 Dance dance dance, dance dance dance
 Makes me wanna dance
 I just wanna dance with you
 I just wanna roll with you
 I just wanna be the one that really gets to know you
 I don't care and I don't mind
 I will spend the whole of my time
 This is what it takes for me
 To hold it down and make you mine

 Every bass man like the first
 Taking us right back to the birth of our love
 Seems to me like I never get enough
 Think about the way that we first kissed
 It was a night like this
 We stayed together every ever since

 (The ooh the ahh the ooh)
 The sounds of the birds and the bees
 Bringing you to your knees
 Is all I wanna do yeah

 [Chorus: X2]

 The only thing between us is the floor
 The dj's playing our favourite song
 So lets not take to long
 I wanna dance all through the night with you
 Dance, dance daaaance, yeah

 (x2)I just wanna dance with you
 I just wanna roll with you
 I just wanna be the one that really gets to know you
 I don't care and I don't mind
 I will spend the whole of my time
 This is what it takes for me to hold it down and make you mine

 Dance dance dance, dance dance dance
 Makes me wanna dance
                        
                    |
