                        Listen how our happy hearts are beating
 Like the ocean beats upon the sand
 And our feet in rhythm keep repeating
 Every little movement of the band Sweet music soft and mellow
 Soothing and slow
 Strains of a mellow cello
 When lights are low Dear, we're so close together
 I love you so
 Why think about the weather
 When lights are low Two hearts revealing
 Music hath charms
 Life's so appealing
 With inspiration in your arms Our lips meeting soft and tender
 Love's all aglow
 Why shouldn't we surrender
 When lights are low Sweet music soft and mellow
 Strains of a mellow cello I mean, dear, we're so close together
 Why think about the weather
 When lights are low? Two hearts revealing
 Music hath charms
 Life's so appealing
 With inspiration in your arms Our lips meeting soft and tender
 Love's all aglow
 Why shouldn't we surrender
 When lights are low? When lights are low
 When lights are low
                        
                    |
