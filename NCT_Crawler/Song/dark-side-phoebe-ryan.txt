                        Bài hát: Dark Side - Phoebe Ryan

At your worst, you're the best
Baby I don't want another version, no
Hard to love, hard to trust
But don't change
Don't be a better person for me

'Cause I'm in love with your dark side
I'm in love with your dark side
I'm in love with your dark side
So don't turn on the light
I'm in love with your dark side
I'm in love with your dark side
I'm in love with your dark side
So don't turn on the light
And stay with me tonight
Don't turn on the light

You're bad, this is good as it gets
I don't want nobody perfect, no
And I want to go deeper, down with you
So pull me beneath the surface
Even if it hurts, I want your heart
Even at your worst, I love you hard
If you wanna keep me, go too far

'Cause I'm in love with your dark side
I'm in love with your dark side
I'm in love with your dark side
So don't turn on the light
And stay with me tonight
Don't turn on the light
And stay with me tonight
Don't turn on the light
And stay with me tonight

I don't want another version
Don't be a better person
Don't want nobody perfect
So pull me beneath the surface

'Cause I'm in love with your dark side
I'm in love with your dark side
I'm in love with your dark side
So don't turn on the light
'Cause I'm in love with your dark side
I'm in love with your dark side
I'm in love with your dark side
So don't turn on the light
And stay with me tonight
Don't turn on the light
Don't turn on the light
And stay with me tonight
