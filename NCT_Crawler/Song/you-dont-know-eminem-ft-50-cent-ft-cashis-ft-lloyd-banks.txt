[Chorus]
Who run it? 
You know ya acting like ya don’t know 
We run it 
You know but ya acting like ya don’t know 
Who run it? 
You know ya acting like ya don’t know 
We run it 
You know but ya acting like ya don’t know 
You know ya acting like ya don’t know 
I tear the club up for show 
This flow is gon’ bring mo dough 
You know but ya acting like ya don’t know 

[50 Cent] 
Now homey I say I runnit runnit cause I’m in control 
Hpnotiq, Hennessy, a couple shots of Patrón 
I have ya feeling aight, I get ya high as a kite 
Party-poppin shawty says she coming with me tonight 
I aint shoulda’ leanin’, I aint snapping and popping either
I’m bopping my head or I’m just standing there watching 
I’m a hustler I hustle, you can tell that I’m paid 
And I protect what I got, I’m in a house with my blade 
Nigga you front you gonna get it, OK now maybe I’ve said it 
Cause I want you to triddip, yea I be on that * hit
You should see when I’m stuntin’ I flash the stones to be wanton 
Push the grip see me rollin’, you can tell that I’m holdin’ 
I’m just doing my thang, you know the units the game 
I got my grimey Shady with me you front you’ll have to get me 
Off your ass I’ll pay the lawsuit and laugh 
Haha its not a big deal it’s nothing but some cash 
Lets Go... 

[Chorus] 


[Eminem] 
When me and Fif’ got together to do this music and movie
The more we became enveloped we just developed a fellowship through it 
It’s no pretend * its friendship mi nemesis es su nemesis 
Same for him it’s just media see to them images it’s just images 
But this * is no gimmicks this is blood-in and blood-out 
When there’s beef you just gotta know when to butt-in and butt-out, 
If there’s a problem we solve it, we don’t resolve it 
It usually just evolv
                        
                    |
