                        My mind runs away with me
 I just wanna be with you
 Where? Where I don't care
 To be next to you
 To be by your side I, I, oh I
 I just wanna get next to you
 I, I, oh I
 I just wanna get next to you My mind will not leave me alone
 Can't sleep, I just want to be with you
 Your touch is all I need
 Your touch is all I need
 To see me through I, I, oh I
 I just wanna get next to you
 I, I, oh I
 I just wanna get next to you I, I, oh I
 I just wanna get next to you
 I, I, oh I
 I just wanna get next to you I, I, oh I
 I just wanna get next to you
 I, I, oh I
 I just wanna get next to you
