                        Half awake and half in dreams
on a Sunday
Sunday night.
Walking all alone
in the streets
on a Sunday
Sunday night.
But then an angel passed me by

A little angel made me sigh.
Just when I wanted you

A dream came true -
called love.

I wanna hear your heartbeat

Wanna feel what you need.
Let me stay tonight
by your side

By your side.
I wanna hear your heartbeat

Share your dreams
when you ́re asleep

Let me hold you tight
in the night

in the night.

I don ́t wanna waste one second
without your loving

Without you
Sunday girl.
You only gotta reach out

Reach out and taste my loving.
Want you so
Sunday girl

Oh
I really want you

Sunday Girl.

Heaven sent you down to me
on a Sunday
Sunday night.
To rescue me from mistery
on a Sunday
Sunday night.
You made me leave
the past behind

I ́ve got you always on my mind

Just when I wanted you

A dream came true -
called love.

I wanna hear your heartbeat ...

I wanna hear your heartbeat ...
                        
                    |
