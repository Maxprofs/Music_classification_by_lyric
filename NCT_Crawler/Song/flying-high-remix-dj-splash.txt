                        Bài hát: Flying High (Remix) - DJ Splash

I'll be back and then you'll be mine
I'll be back and then you'll be mine

Time is passing by, you gotta make it through the night
until the morning you say "Goodbye, for now darling."
Maybe you will come back, on another day you'll do that
Go away with the wind, it takes you now

We are flying high,
saying farewell would be a lie
There's no need tonight to spend a sleepless lonely night
We are flying high,
There's no way to say goodbye
You're denying, why?
I'll be back and then you'll be mine

Time is passing by, you gotta make it through the night
until the morning you say "Goodbye, for now darling."
Maybe you will come back, on another day you'll do that
Go away with the wind, it takes you now

We are flying high,
saying farewell would be a lie
There's no need tonight to spend a sleepless lonely night
We are flying high,
There's no way to say goodbye
You're denying, why?
I'll be back and then you'll be mine

It's night, you gotta be the fly
flying to the lamp, burning her little chances in the light.
She'll never learn to bite, but for now you cannot fight
and you're here to do it tight, burn your wings now and cry

Long time passed to do that and you plainly got a chance to be my mistress, you had to go.
If you want to fly on, please drop out before fall, waiting for the last call, and you never say no

Time is passing by, you gotta make it through the night
until the morning you say "Goodbye, for now darling."
Maybe you will come back, on another day you'll do that
Go away with the wind, it takes you now

We are flying high,
saying farewell would be a lie
There's no need tonight to spend a sleepless lonely night
We are flying high,
There's no way to say goodbye
You're denying, why?
I'll be back and then you'll be mine
                        
                    |
