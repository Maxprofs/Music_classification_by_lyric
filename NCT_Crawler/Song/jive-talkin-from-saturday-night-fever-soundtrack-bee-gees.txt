The Bee Gees
It's just your jive talkin'
you're telling me lies, yeah
Jive talkin'

so misunderstood, yeah
You really no good
Oh, my child
You'll never know
Just what you mean to me
You got so much
You're gonna take away my energy
With all your jive talkin'
You're telling me lies, yeah
Good lovin'
Still gets in my eyes
Nobody believes what you say
That gets in the way
Oh my love
You're so good
Treating me so cruel
There you go
with your fancy lies
Leavin' me lookin'
like a dumbstruck fool
with all your
You wear a disguise
you just ain't no good
Love talkin'

Just isn't a crime
And if there's somebody
You'll love till you die
then all that jive talkin'

You're telling me lies,yeah
Is all very fine, yeah
Jive talkin', just isn't a crime
