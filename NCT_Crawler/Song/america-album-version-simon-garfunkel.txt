                        Let us be lovers we'll marry our fortunes together
 I've got some real estate here in my bag
 So we bought a pack of cigarettes and Mrs. Wagner's pies
 And we walked off to look for America
 Cathy I said as we boarded a Greyhound in Pittsburgh
 Michigan seems like a dream to me now
 It took me four days to hitchhike from Saginaw
 I've gone to look for America
 Laughing on the bus playing games with the faces
 She said the man in the gabardine suit was a spy
 I said be careful his bowtie is really a camera
 Toss me a cigaret I think there's one in the raincoat
 We smoked the last one an hour ago
 So I looked at the scenary she read her magazine
 And the moon rose over an open field
 Cathy I'm lost I said though I knew she was sleeping
 I'm empty and aching and I don't know why
 Counting the cars on the New Jersey Turnpike
 They've all come to look for America
 All come to look for America
