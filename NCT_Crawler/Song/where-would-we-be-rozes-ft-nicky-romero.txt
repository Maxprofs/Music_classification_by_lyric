                        Bài hát: Where Would We Be - Rozes, Nicky Romero

[Verse 1]
Been a minute since high school
And I still kinda miss you (Ah)
Is it weird that I do, I do
Are you still in your basement
Smoking weed with the same friends?
Just living for the weekend
Like we used to

[Pre-Chorus]
Up all night, mattress on the floor
Wasting time, Nintendo 64
Shouldn't think about it anymore, anymore

[Chorus]
Where would we be
If we were still passed out on your sofa, watchin' TV?
And it was still my head on your shoulder
Where would we be if in another lifetime
I didn't move to California for the limelight?
I wouldn't have to wonder what it would've been like
If we'da only *** got it right the first time

[Post-Chorus]
Where would we be?
Where would we be?

[Verse 2]
And I know I shouldn't reminisce
But I've been drinking and I miss my accomplice
I know it's late
Different time zones, different states
But I bet you're still

[Pre-Chorus]
Up all night, mattress on the floor
Wasting time, Nintendo 64
Shouldn't think about it anymore, anymore

[Chorus]
Where would we be
If we were still passed out on your sofa, watchin' TV?
And it was still my head on your shoulder
Where would we be if in another lifetime
I didn't move to California for the limelight?
I wouldn't have to wonder what it would've been like
If we'da only *** got it right the first time

[Post-Chorus]
Where would we be?
Where would we be?

[Bridge]
If we never went home
Stayed out still stoned
If the sun never rose
We'd still be close
But that's not how it goes
Same song gets old
When you're living for the weekend
Just living for the weekend

[Chorus]
Where would we be
If we were still passed out on your sofa, watchin' TV?
And it was still my head on your shoulder
Where would we be if in another lifetime
I didn't move to California for the limelight?
I wouldn't have to wonder what it would've been like
If we'da only *** got it right the first time

[Post-Chorus]
Where would we be?
Where would we be?
Where would we be?
                        
                    |
