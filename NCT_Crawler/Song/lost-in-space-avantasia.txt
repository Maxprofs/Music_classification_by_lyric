                        Another star 
Has fallen without sound 
Another spark
Has burned out in the cold
Another door 
To barrens standing open
And who is there 
To tell me not to give and not to go?

How could I know? 
How could I know 
That I'll get lost in space to roam forever?
How could I know? 
How could I see? 
Feeling like lost in space to roam forever

I'm crawling down 
The doorway to the badlands 
And kicking down
Are you heard: it's to the black 
And all the damage
Fading in the rear-view mirror
When the demons 
Are calling me, they're dragging me away

How could I know? 
How could I know 
That I'll get lost in space to roam forever?
How could I know? 
How could I see? 
Feeling like lost in space to roam forever

Lost in space. 
Lost in time. 
Lost in space. 
Lost in Time. 
Lost in Space.

How could I know? 
How could I know? 
How could I know? 
How could I know 
That I'll get lost in space to roam for ever?
How could I now? 
How could I see feeling like lost in space to roam forever?
Forever...
