                        Bài hát: Remember I Told You - Nick Jonas, Anne Marie, Mike Posner

[Nick Jonas:]
Remember I told you, I need you
Remember the spotlight, what's that?
All of the words that I'm saying
Are just a fancy way of saying "I care"

I don't suppose you have a moment to spare me
Do you? Do you?
I've been looking for lovin', all the wrong places
You too? You too?

I don't like to wait when you tell me "oh well"
I have the suspicion you're not being yourself
I don't suppose you have a moment to spare me
Do you? Do you?

Remember I told you, I need you
Remember the spotlight, what's that?
All of the words that I'm saying
Are just a fancy way of saying "I care"

[Anne-Marie:]
You're probably somewhere, with someone I don't know
That's cool, and that's cool
And I hope that she gives you, all the things that you deserve
That's true, that's true

[Nick Jonas & Anne-Marie:]
I don't like to wait when you tell me "oh well"
I have the suspicion you're not being yourself
You're probably somewhere, with someone I don't know
That's cool, and that's cool

[Nick Jonas, Anne-Marie & Mike Posner:]
Remember I told you, I need you
Remember the spotlight, what's that?
All of the words that I'm saying
Are just a fancy way of saying "I care"

[Mike Posner:]
Let it cut it off, and we know why
I'm in love with myself, cold inside
Too many shoes in your closet, go some miles
I suck at talking to girls, here goes a try
More woman than I should've in a century
Bitches on my side like a Kennedy
Starting to drain all my energy
I love it, shoot the frame like an enemy
At the same time, and I can't lie
Too many girls for the way that I rock the bassline
You got addicted to the seas of the bassline
Lets see how you're gonna do with the back and forth fameline
After all the *** we been through
I play the rocksea, I ain't 'bout to guestlist you
And I know I'm talking ***, it ain't fair
Hate is just a fancy way saying that I care

[Nick Jonas, Anne-Marie & Mike Posner:]
Remember I told you, I need you
Remember the spotlight, what's that?
All of the words that I'm saying
Are just a fancy way of saying "I care"

Remember I told you, I need you
Remember the spotlight, what's that?
All of the words that I'm saying
Are just a fancy way of saying "I care"
Saying I care
