                        Bài hát: Save Me(Album Version (Explicit)) - Nicki Minaj

I drove for miles just to find you and find myself
All these screams, all these voices in my head
You gave me strength, gave me hope for a lifetime
I never was satisfied

This time won't you save me?
This time won't you save me?
Baby, I can feel myself givin' up, givin' up

This time won't you save me?
This time won't you save me?
Baby, I can feel myself givin' up, givin' up
Givin' up, givin' up, givin' up

It's not your fault I'm a bitch, I'm a monster
Yes I'm a beast and I feast when I conquer
But I'm alone on my throne, all these witches
I came this way all this way just to say

This time won't you save me?
This time won't you save me?
Baby, I can feel myself givin' up, givin' up

This time won't you save me?
This time won't you save me?
Baby, I can feel myself givin' up, givin' up
Givin' up, givin' up, givin' up

I'm givin' up, baby, yes
I'm givin' up, baby
(Feels like I've been drivin' for miles)
I'm givin' up, baby
(And I can't seem to silence these voices in my head)

This time won't you save me?
(Who'll save me?)
This time won't you save me?
(Who'll save me?)

This time won't you save me?
This time won't you save me?
Baby, I can feel myself givin' up, givin' up

This time won't you save me?
This time won't you save me?
Baby, I can feel myself givin' up, givin' up

This time won't you save me?
This time won't you save me?
Baby, I can feel myself givin' up
Givin' up, givin' up
