                        When he loved me nothing in this world
 Could touch his love
 And now the light of love is back
 Can I return the joys he's dreaming of?
 I don't know
 I don't know (But if it don't work out)
 The tears that I cried in vain
 Won't bring him home, no, no
 I wanna bring him home Will he still care for me
 The way he did he before?
 Or, will he turn away
 And tell me he don't love me anymore?
 I don't know
 Oh, I don't know (But if it don't work out)
 The tears that I cried in vain
 Won't bring him home
 I wanna bring him home But if I could forget
 The tears and the crying
 That I went through once before, yeah
 Maybe my love and I could start
 We'd start again, yeah One day I know we'll find again
 The love we had and I
 Will know and feel
 The joys and pleasures that I'm dreaming of
 I don't know
 I don't know (But if it don't work out)
 The tears that I cried in vain
 Ain't gonna bring him home, again
 Ain't gonna bring him home Hey, But if it don't work out
 The tears that I cried in vain
 Hey, ain't gonna bring him home again
 I'm gonna cry my heart out waiting for him, yeah
 Cry my heart out, yes I will
 Cry my heart out, yes I will
 Cry my heart
