                        Bài hát : Bye, Autumn (Jealousy Incarnate Ost) - Saltnpaper

Slowly fall a thousand stars
And everything all goes by
Wasting all I loved
Quietly
all the dreams are gone away
In a good night
Never ever say goodbye
Always I wonder why
Wasting all the time
Silently
we collide so fast so deep
In a goodnight
Closed my eyes
I run and run away from all I see
Whispered the night
That someday my tears will flow
in this blue rain
If I cry if I smile
Will my life still go on
If I try if I chase
Will my love still go on
Somehow I can’t get out of here
Sometimes I need you near me
Keep me right
keep my breathe
Till the end of story
Let me wait
if you’re late
Till my words find your ears
Tonight you steer my heart away
Just leaving a trail of sorrow
All the beautiful days in your eye
We don’t need a smile today
to say goodbye
Lie me on a lullaby
If it is a little hope
In a pretty starry night
If I cry if I smile
Will my life still go on
If I try if I chase
Will my love still go on
Somehow I can’t get out of here
Sometimes I need you near me
Keep me right
keep my breathe
Till the end of story
Let me wait
if you’re late
Till my words find your ears
Someday you colour me anew
Somewhere underneath the sky
                        
                    |
