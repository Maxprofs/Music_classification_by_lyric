Akon

Everything I have everything I own
All my mistakes man you already know
I wanna be free I wanna be free

From Senegal West Africa
To St Louis Missouri
Thanks to Catherine 
For giving my paps his glory
He came down with his drum
And a dream to change the world
In a free uplifting world
And thats all we ever want
Mom Came a little after
Gave birth to my brother
And then all of the pressure
Made em' fight one and another
See the pain would never left
Did the best with what they had
They knew the world was out for
And they they searched to find their
Freedom Freedom Freedom Freedom
Everything I have everything I own
All my mistakes man you already know
I wanna be free I wanna be free
So I search to find my
Freedom Freedom Freedom Freedom
Everything I have everything I own
All my mistakes girl you already know
I wanna be free I wanna be free yeah

As a kid I never knew
That after this that we would make it through
So I found myself skipping school
Couse' the girls gonna think i'm cool
And because of that I did'nt care
Wether or not I went to jail
I just wanna be treated fair
Cause' thats all I ever knew
Tellin' me I need to slow down
Cause' everybody in the whole town
Cause' they know how I get down
Far enough from another town
Can you believe we're still around
Have my soul baby in the ground
And we ain't gonna stop that
Until we get that
Freedom Freedom Freedom Freedom
Everything I have everything I own
All my mistakes man you already know
I wanna be free I wanna be free
Won't stop til' I find my
Freedom Freedom Freedom Freedom
Everything I have everything I own
All my mistakes girl you already know
I wanna be free I wanna be free yeah
If you wanna be free and the land is drug free
put your hands up put your hans up
If you wanna be free from all your misery
put your hands up put your hans up
If you wanna be free with plenty money
put your hands up put your hans up
If you wanna be free just prace your hands 
put your hands up put your hans up
Freedom Freedom(Freedom) Freedom Freedom
Everything I have everything I own
All my mistakes girl you already know
I wanna be free(wanna be free) 
I wanna be free(wanna be free)
