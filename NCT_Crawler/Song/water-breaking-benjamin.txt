                        What's all this talk of the notion?
 I'd rather drink from the ocean
 What did you mean when you said "No"?
 I only want what is best for you
 But I'll never let you drown
 No I won't ever let you down 'Cause I am my enemy
 The water's up to the knee
 I never wanted anythin' from you
 Yes I do, yes I do
 My engine's runnin' on time
 My head's so *** up inside
 Shut up, I know, I said so There is no way to recover
 You told me there is no other
 The surface is getting hotter
 Well I'll shove your head under water
 But I won't ever let you drown
 No I won't ever let you down 'Cause I am my enemy
 The water's up to the knee
 I never wanted anythin' from you
 Yes I do, yes I do
 My engine's runnin' on time
 My head's so *** up inside
 Shut up, I know, I said so Yeah 'Cause I am my enemy
 The water's up to the knee
 I never wanted anythin' from you
 Yes I do, yes I do
 My engine's runnin' on time
 My head's so *** up inside
 Shut up, I know, I said so Shut up, I know, I said so
 Shut up, 'cause I know, I said so
