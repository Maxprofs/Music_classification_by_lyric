These lips 
Can't wait to taste your skin ... ...

No, no
And these eyes, yeah
Can't wait to see your grin .. ...
Ooh ooh baby
Just let my love
Just let my love adorn you .. ...
Please baby, yeah
You gotta know ...
You gotta know
You know
That I adorn you .. ...
Yeah baby

Baby this fist
Will always protect ya, 
lady
And this mind oh,
Will never neglect you .. ..
Yeah baby,
Oh baby
And this thang
Trying to break us down
Don't let that affect us,
No baby
You just gotta let my love
Let my love
Let my love adorn you
Ah, le-le-le-let it just adorn you
You got to know
You gotta know
Know that I adorn you
Just that babe

Let my love adorn you baby
Don't you ever
Don't you let nobody tell you different baby
I'll always adorn you
You gotta know now ...
You got to know know know ...
