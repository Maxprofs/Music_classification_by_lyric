                        Bài hát: On The Line - Demi Lovato, Jonas Brothers 

I didn't wanna say
I'm sorry for breaking us apart
Joe:
I didn't wanna say
It was my fault
Even though I knew it was
Demi:
I didn't wanna call you back
Cause I knew that I was wrong
Both:
Yeah I knew I was wrong

[Chorus:]
Demi:
One in the same never to change
Our love was beautiful
Both:
We got it all destined to fall
Our love was tragically
Joe:
Wanted to call
Demi:
No need to fight
Joe:
Cause you know I wouldn't lie
Both:
But tonight we'll leave it on the line

Demi:
Listen baby
Nick:
Never woulda said forever if we knew it'd end so fast
Demi:
Why did you say ‘ I love you ‘
If you knew that it wouldn't last
Nick:
Baby I just cant hear what your saying
The line is breaking up
Demi:
Or maybe that's just us, oh baby just us

[Chorus]

Joe:
Tried to call again and get your mailbox
Like a letter left unread
Demi:
Apologies are often open-ended
Both:
But this one better unsaid

[Chorus]

Demi:
We'll leave it on the line
Nick:
Yeah, oh yeah
Demi:
We'll leave it on the line tonight
                        
                    |
