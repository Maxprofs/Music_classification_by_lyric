Yeah, hmmm
Murder murder, I took the red pill
My heart it goes boom every time that we feel
And if it beat yea, then I guess me beat you
Fell into his arms got me heading for the hills

I'm saying, woah
Feel it up and down and in my soul
If I used to be broken, now I'm whole, oh no
I'm at his mercy, mercy, mercy tonight

I can't count to no amount
There's no limits, no no
To the ways I could love you, babe
Take me over, I can't get over
There's no limits, no no
To the ways I could love you, babe

One two three, to infinity yeah
Two three four, it's ubiquity
It's four five six, to unlimitedless love

If there's another one
He's not in this world, love
Can't be no other one
There is only you

Only one and one, only leaves us two love
And when I'm through being your girl
We can stop the whole world for us

I'm saying, woah
Feel it up and down and in your soul
I'll forever be here at his mercy, mercy, mercy
Loving him for eternity, eternity, eternity
Cause I

I can't count to no amount
There's no limits, no no
To the ways I could love you, babe
Take me over I can't get over
There's no limits, no no
To the ways I could love you, babe

One two three, to infinity yeah
Two three four, here's my prophecy yeah
Four five six, to unlimitedless love

Ah oh oh, oh oh oh
Ah oh oh, oh oh oh

One two three, to infinity yeah
Two three four, this is my decree yeah
Four five six, to unlimitedless love

Unlimited, limited, limited, limitedless love
Unlimitedless love, unlimitedless love
Unlimited, limited, limited, limitedless love
Unlimitedless love, unlimitedless love

Ah oh oh, oh oh oh
Ah oh oh, oh oh oh
