How did you get here?
I'm drunk and confused
I tried to be patient with you
Yeah
High up, but you fall down harder
Trapped in the concept
Falsely accused

Misused, and misled
Bitch, I'm hoping you *** rest in peace
(I tried to be patient with you)
(Yeah)
(High up) Now the fact that I'm alone is *** comforting
And I can't seem to shake this *** feeling in my

(How did you get here) Cold shoulder, heart broken, misspoken
I'm cut open, the fingers in all my stab wounds
And if she could, she'd prolly dance
On my grave, inside my head
I see your face, I *** hate
That I love you still

(High up) Yeah
(But you fall down harder)
Carry on, life flies, so just carry on
With this pain inside of my chest
Got no choice but to carry on, uh

Carry on, life flies, so just carry on
With this pain inside of my chest
Got no choice but to carry on, uh
Carry on, life flies, so just carry on
With this pain inside of my chest

Got no choice but to carry on, uh
Yeah
How did you get here?
I'm drunk and confused
I tried to be patient with you, yeah
High up, but you fall down harder
