                        "If I had a world of my own, everything would be nonsense" 
"Nothing would be what it is, because everything would be what it isn't" 

I invite you to a world where there is no such thing as time 
And every creature lends themselves to change your state of mind 
And the girl that chase the rabbit drank the wine and took the pill 
Has locked herself in limbo to see how it truly feels 

To stand outside your virtue 
No one can ever hurt you 
Or so they say 

Her name is Alice (Alice) 
She climbs into the window 
Through shapes and shadows 
Alice (Alice) 
And even though she's dreaming, she knows 

Sometimes the curiosity can kill the soul but leave the pain 
And every ounce of innocence is left inside her brain 
And through the looking glass we see she's painfully returned 
But now off with her head I fear is everyone's concern 

You see there's no real ending 
It's only the beginning 
Come out and play 

Her name is Alice (Alice) 
She climbs into the window 
Through shapes and shadows 
Alice (Alice) 
And even though she's dreaming 
She's unlocked the meaning for you 
This kingdom good riddance her freedom and innocence 
Has brought this whole thing down 

Her name is Alice (Alice) 
She climbs into the window 
Through shapes and shadows 
Alice (Alice) 
And even though she's dreaming 
She's unlocked the meaning 

(Red knight, White knight,) 
(Marching into the fight) 
(Drink me. Shrink me.) 
(Fill me to sink me) 

(Red knight(Alice) White knight,) 
(Marching into the fight) 
(Drink me. Shrink me.) 
(Fill me to sink me) 
She's unlocked the meaning for you 


"And contrariwise what it is it wouldn't be, and what it wouldn't be it would" 
"You see?"
