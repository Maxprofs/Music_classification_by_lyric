                        Song: Uncharted - Sara Bareilles

 No words
 My tears won't make any room for 'em, oh
 And it don't hurt
 Like anything I've ever felt before This is no broken heart
 No familiar scars
 This territory goes uncharted Just me
 In a room sunk down in a house in a town
 And I don't breathe
 Though I never meant to let it get away from me Now I have too much to hold
 Everybody has to get their hands on gold
 And I want uncharted Stuck under the ceiling
 I made, I can't help the feeling I'm going down
 Follow if you want, I won't just hang around
 Like you'll show me where to go I'm already out
 Of foolproof ideas so don't ask me how
 To get started
 It's all uncharted Each day
 I'm countin' up the minutes 'til I get alone
 'Cause I can't stay
 In the middle of it all, it's nobody's fault But I'm so low
 Never knew so much I didn't know
 Oh, everything is uncharted I know I'm getting nowhere
 When I only sit and stare like I'm going down
 Follow if you want, I won't just hang around
 Like you'll show me where to go I'm already out
 Of foolproof ideas so don't ask me how
 To get started
 It's all uncharted Jump start my kaleidoscope heart
 I love to watch the colors fade
 They may not make sense
 But they sure as hell made me I won't go as a passenger, no
 Waiting for the road to be laid
 Though I may be going down
 I'll take in flame over burning out Compare
 Where you are to where you wanna be
 And you'll get nowhere I'm going down
 Follow if you want, I won't just hang around
 Like you'll show me where to go I'm already out
 Of foolproof ideas so don't ask me how
 To get started I'm going down
 Follow if you want, I won't just hang around
 Like you'll show me where to go I'm already out
 Of foolproof ideas so don't ask me how
 To get started
 It's all uncharted
