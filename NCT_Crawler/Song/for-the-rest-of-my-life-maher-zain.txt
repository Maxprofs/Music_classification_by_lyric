                        Bài hát: For The Rest Of My Life - Maher Zain

I've got a feeling inside of me
Running off to my veins
It's like electrical energy
A world's about to change
It's an open road
So here I go

Chorus :
The rest of my life
Is starting tonight
Feels like I'm finally on my way
I'm looking ahead
Can't tell where it ends
But I'm gonna take a leap of faith
And I'm gonna hold on tight
And right is right
The rest of my life

I'm gonna go for it all aloud
I know there's no guarantee
But I've been given a chance and now
What's next is up to me
I'm gonna save my sights
So light those lights

Repeat Chorus

If all the world's a stage
I'm here to take my place
I know I'll always find a way to shine

The rest of my life
Is starting tonight
Feels like I'm fin'lly on my way
I'm looking ahead
Can't tell where it ends
But I'm gonna take a leap of faith

The rest of my life
Is starting tonight
Feels like I'm fin'lly on my way
It starts with a dream
Of who I can be
Wherever it takes me I can wait
So I'm gonna hold on tight
And right is right
The rest of my life
The rest of my life
The rest of my life
                        
                    |
