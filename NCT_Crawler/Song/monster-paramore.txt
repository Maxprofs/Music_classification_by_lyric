                        You were my conscience, so silent now you’re like water
And we started drowning, not like we’d sink any farther.
But I let my heart go, it’s somewhere down the bottom.
But I’ll get a new one, come back from the hope that you’ve stolen.

I’ll stop the whole world, I’ll stop the whole world
From turning into a monster, and eating us alive
Don’t you ever wonder how we survive?
Well now that your gone, the world is ours.

I’m only human, I’ve got a skeleton in me
but I’m not the villain, despite what you’re always preaching.
Call me a traitor, I’m just collecting your victims
And they’re getting stronger
I hear them calling.

I’ll stop the whole world, I’ll stop the whole world
From turning into a monster, and eating us alive
Don’t you ever wonder how we survive?
Well now that your gone, the world is ours.

Well you thought of straight solutions
that I liked the attention
And not always knowing the answers
You’re gonna lose it
You’re gonna lose it

I’ll stop the whole world, I’ll stop the whole world
From turning into a monster, and eating us alive
Don’t you ever wonder how we survive?
Well now that your gone, the world is ours.
