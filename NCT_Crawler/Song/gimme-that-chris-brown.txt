The young boy just turned 16 and I got
6 4's and hot bikes that I rock.
Keep 3 or 4 sweeties on clock,
but all that swinging in that bikini just might convince him.
Slow all the traffic down to a complete stop,
'Cause you speaking that slang that I talk.
That sassy tempo with that walk,
May be the reason that all this teenies may never see me.

Momma you may be 3 years older but you hot (gimme that)
you be talking like you like what I got (gimme that)
I know you like it how I lean in the 'lac,
you could be in the back saying (gimme, gimme, gimme)
Momma you may be 3 years older but you hot (gimme that)
you be talking like you like what I got (gimme that)
I know you like it how I lean in the 'lac,
you could be in the back saying (gimme, gimme, gimme)

Ma, take a break, let me explain to you,
What ya body got a young boy ready to do.
If you take a chance, and let me put them things on you,
I could show you why I make them straight A's in school.
I'm a HUSTLA!
Trust my frame and age.
Got you thinking that I'm just too young to turn your page.
I can PICTURE!
Us switching lanes in the coupe
With you on the phone screaming my name.

(Chris!)
