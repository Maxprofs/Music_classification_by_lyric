                        Bài hát : Stronger (Audition) - Inez

Once again I'm longing
For your hungry touch
Picturing you on me
And missing you so much
You turn on my imagination
Though you're far away
And in my fantasy you crave my body
I need you back to stay

I've got my inside out and my headache won't stop
I fail to not look back as I'm bouncing down the wrong track
Half way up feels like going down
But I am getting stronger and stronger
But I am getting stronger and stronger

Midnight turns to morning
And I don't get no sleep
I know that you are out there somewhere being someone else's treat
Your fingers know just how to please me
And chills run down my spine
And when you lick and spill your kisses
I am shivering inside

I've got my inside out and my headache won't stop
I fail to not look back as I'm bouncing down the wrong track
Half way up feels like going down
But I am getting stronger and stronger
But I am getting stronger and stronger
But I am getting stronger and stronger
But I am getting stronger and stronger

I've got my inside out and my headache won't stop
I fail to not look back as I'm bouncing down the wrong track
Half way up feels like going down
But I am getting stronger and stronger
But I am getting stronger and stronger
But I am getting stronger and stronger

I've got my inside out and my headache won't stop
I fail to not look back as I'm bouncing down the wrong track
Half way up feels like going down
But I am getting stronger and stronger
                        
                    |
