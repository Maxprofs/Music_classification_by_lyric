                        Push It To The Limit lyrics

Yeah
Come on now
Here we go
Let's do it

Yeah..

Push it push it to the limit limit
Cause we're in it to win it in it to win it
Oh yeah

I realized that this is where my heart is
Now is the time to finish what i started
Can't worry bout what other people might say
It's who i am
Gotta live my dream my own way

Work work it harder
Gotta take it farther
No holding back
You know we gotta do it right now
Be even better
Work work together
It's now or never
Show em how we shine we gotta

Push it push it to the limit limit
Cause we're in it to win it in it to win it
Oh yeah

Push it push it to the limit limit
Give it all we can give it
We're in it to win it
Oh yeah

Push it push it to the limit limit

That's right

Gonna turn it up
That's the way we do it now
No time to stop
The champions are in the house
Yeah we can be
Winners 'cause we understand
Our destiny is right here in our hands

Work work it harder
Gotta take it farther
No holding back
We reaching for the sky now
Be even better
Work work together
It's now or never
Show em how we fly (we gotta)

Push it push it to the limit limit
Cause we're in it to win it in it to win it
Oh yeah

Push it push it to the limit limit
Give it all we can give it
We're in it to win it
Oh yeah

Gotta work it now
Work it out
We got it
Wanna hear the crowd
Everybody now
Gotta work it now
Work it out
Can't stop us
Gotta show them how
We gonna bring the house down

Push it push it to the limit limit
Cause we're in it to win it in it to win it
Let's go

Push it push it to the limit limit
Give it all we can
