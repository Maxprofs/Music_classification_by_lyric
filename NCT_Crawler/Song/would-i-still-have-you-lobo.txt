                        Would I Still Have You
Artist: LOBO
When I was young I had a dream
That I would meet someone like you
And we would have a happy home
If the world would leave us alone
So it came to pass it all came true
You needed me like I needed you
But the world kept moving on
And our life was changed by a song

Sometimes I wonder and I worry too
If I did not know how to sing
Would I still have you?
That's the time I wished
I'd never bought that first guitar
I'd be out somewhere in Oklahoma
Fixing cars
But maybe after my hard working
Day was through
I'd still have you

It's hard to have loving on your mind
With people lining up for it all the time
And the world I loved went floating by
How did I miss the hurt in your eyes

Sometimes I wonder and I worry too
If I did not know how to sing
Would I still have you?
That's the time I wished
I'd never bought that first guitar
I'd be out somewhere in Oklahoma
Fixing cars
But maybe after my hard working
Day was through
I'd still have you

When I was young I had a dream
That I would meet someone like you
                        
                    |
