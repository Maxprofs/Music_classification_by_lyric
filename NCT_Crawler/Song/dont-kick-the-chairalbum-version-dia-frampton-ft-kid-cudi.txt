                        Bài hát: Don'T Kick The Chair(Album Version) - Dia Frampton, Kid Cudi

Have you ever felt like everybody's watching
Waiting for you to lose
Have you ever felt like you're living in a spot light
Searching for the real you
Tell me have you ever woken up
Just to wish you could close your eyes
Getting hard to find a friend in a city like this
Where you can't even trust a smile

[Pre Chorus:]
There are lonely nights when you see no hope
And you're feeling short of breath
Like a whole damn world is a braided rope
In a noose around your neck

[Chorus:]
Don't kick the chair
It's gonna get better
Don't kick the chair
It can only get better

Have you ever felt love, really really felt love
The kind that could save a life
But right before you know it you find out in a moment
You're gonna have to say goodbye

[Pre Chorus:]
There are lonely nights when you see no hope
And you're feeling short of breath
Like a whole damn world is a braided rope
In a noose around your neck

[Chorus:]
Don't kick the chair
It's gonna get better
Don't kick the chair
It can only get better

[Kid Cudi:]
Yep yep you know
If I can make it through then you can to
Yep yep I'm good focus like always
Feels like I've been hit hit hit by ten brick walls
Some people like just sit sit around and wait for you to fall
Then bounce back way quicker than you fell down
Don't Kick The Chair lyrics on ***
Laugh in their face like what
See nothing can break me
No no no no listen

If you gotta think twice about life,
Something really ain't right
You don't need no help,
You can be better all by yourself
You can be better all by yourself
You can be better all by yourself
You can be better all by yourself

[Chorus:]
Don't kick the chair
It's gonna get better
Don't kick the chair
It can only get better

Don't kick the chair
(Yep Yep, you know...You can be better all by yourself)
It's gonna get better (Yep Yep, I'm good)
Don't kick the chair
(Yep Yep, you know...You can be better all by yourself)
It can only get better
                        
                    |
