                        Romaji:
Kanashimi ni nureta tsuki ga shizuka ni
Daichi wo akaku akaku somete kieru

Boku no koe ga kikoe masu ka
Satsubatsu to shita kono jidai de
Boku wa boku de irare masu ka

Kokoro afure dasu namida wa
Kitto mirai wo motometeru akashi na no
Ima no muryoku wo nagekanaide mae wo mitsumete
You can get it over
Over the clouds

Kisetsu wo utsurou kaze no zawameki
Owari no mienai tatakai he no jokyoku

Hito wa naze ni wasureteku no
Ari kitari no kono nichijou ni
Kakegae no nai mono ga aru to

BOROBORO ni natta hane demo
Dareka wo omou sono kimochi ga aru nara
Donna kurushimi ni mukatte mo tonde yukeru sa
You can get it over
Over the clouds

Boku no koe ga kikoe masu ka
Satsubatsu to shita kono jidai de
Boku wa boku de irare masu ka

Kokoro afure dasu namida wa
Kitto mirai wo motometeru akashi na no
BOROBORO ni natta hane demo
Dareka wo omou sono kimochi ga aru nara
Donna kurushimi ni mukatte mo tonde yukeru sa
You can get it over
Over the clouds
You can get it over
Over the clouds

Nagaruru chishio wa inochi no hikari
Yami yo ni tomoru wa inochi no hikari

Trans(eng):
The moon is soaked in sadness
It quietly paints the land red and disappears

Can you hear my voice ? 
Can I stay myself
In this bloodthirsty era ? 

The tears that overflow your heart
Are surely proof of your wish for a future
Gaze forward without lamenting your current powerlessness
You can get it over
Over the clouds

The sound of the wind changes the seasons
It's the prelude to a fight that has no end in sight

Why do people forget
That our common, everyday lives
Hold precious things ? 

If you still hold feelings for someone
Even though your wings have become tattered
You can fly away no matter what pain you might face
You can get it over
Over the clouds

Can you hear my voice ? 
Can I stay myself
In this bloodthirsty era ? 

The tears that overflow your heart
Are surely proof of your wish for a future
If you still hold feelings for someone
Even though your wings have become tattered
You can fly away no matter what pain you might face
You can get it over
Over the clouds

The light of life is a flood of emotions
The light of life is lit in the dark night
                        
                    |
