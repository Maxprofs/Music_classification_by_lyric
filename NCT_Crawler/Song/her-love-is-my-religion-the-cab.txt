                        Bài hát : Her Love Is My Religion - The Cab

(I said her love is my religion,
It's my religion, it's my religion,
It's my religion)

Some have their Bibles, and some go to church.
Well I found my heaven inside of her.
We only talked until believe,
Gotta find our destiny.
I've got her and she's got me.

I see her when I close my eyes,
She's my only God in life.
Never gonna say goodbye,

'Cause I see the stars in the freckles on her face,
And I'm seein' God every time she says my name.
So mother Mary, pray for me,
Without her I'm so lost,
Her love is my religion.

Some have their crosses and their golden gates.
Well she is the grace I wear when I lose my faith.
We only talked until believe,
The words we say before we sleep.
Close my eyes and she's my dream,
She's the truth inside the world of lies.
Keeping all my hope alive,
Never going to say goodbye.

'Cause I see the stars in the freckles on her face.
And I'm seein' God every time she says my name.
So mother Mary, pray for me,
Without her I'm so lost.
Her love is my religion.

Her love is my religion,
It's my religion,
It's my religion.
I said her love is my religion,
It's my religion,
It's my religion,
I said her love is my religion,
It's my religion,
It's my religion.

'Cause I see the stars in the freckles on her face,
And I'm seein' God every time she says my name.
So mother Mary, pray for me,
Without her I'm so lost
Her love is my religion.

I said her love is my religion,
It's my religion,
It's my religion.
I said her love is my religion,
It's my religion,
It's my religion,
It's my religion.
