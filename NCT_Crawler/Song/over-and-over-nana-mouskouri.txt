                        I never dared to reach for the moon
 I never thought I'd know heaven so soon
 I couldn't hope to say how I feel
 The joy in my heart, no words can reveal Over and over, I whisper your name
 Over and over, I kiss you again
 I see the light of love in your eyes
 Love is forever, no more goodbyes Now just a memory, the tears that I cried
 Now just a memory, the sighs that I sighed
 Dreams that I cherished, all have come true
 All my tomorrows, I give to you Over and over, I whisper your name
 Over and over, I kiss you again
 I see the light of love in your eyes
 Love is forever, no more goodbyes Life's summer leaves may turn to gold
 The love that we share will never grow old
 Here in your arms, no world's far away
 Here in your arms, forever I'll stay Over and over, I whisper your name
 Over and over, I kiss you again
 I see the light of love in your eyes
 Love is forever, no more goodbyes Over and over, I whisper your name
 Over and over, I kiss you again
 I see the light of love in your eyes
 Love is forever, no more goodbyes
