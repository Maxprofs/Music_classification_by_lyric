                        Bài hát: Love Drough - Beyonce

Ten times of nine, I know you're lying
But nine times outta ten, I know you're trying
So I'm trying to be fair
And you're trying to be there and to care
And you're caught up in your permanent emotions
All the loving I've been giving goes unnoticed
It's just floating in the air, lookie there
Are you aware you're my lifeline, are you tryna kill me
If I wasn't me, would you still feel me?
Like on my worst day?
Or am I not thirsty enough?
I don't care about the lights or the beams
Spend my life in the dark for the sake of you and me
Only way to go is up, skin thick, too tough...

Cause you, you, you, you and me could move a mountain
You, you, you, you and me could calm a war down
You, you, you, you and me could make it rain now
You, you, you, you and me could stop this love drought
Nine times outta Ten I'm in my feelings
But Ten times out of Nine I'm only human 
Tell me what did I do wrong?
Feel like the question has been posed
I'm moving on
I'll always be commited I'll be focused
I always payed attention been devoted
Tell me what did I do wrong?
Oh, I already asked that... My bad

But you my lifeline, think you tryna kill meIf I wasn't me, would you still feel me?Like on my worst day?Or am I not thirsty enough?I don't care about the lights or the beams
Put my life in the dark for the sake of you and me
Only way to go is up
Them old bitches is so wack I'm so tough, wassup
Cause you, you, you, you and me could move a mountainYou, you, you, you and me could calm a war downYou, you, you, you and me could make it rain nowAnd you, you, you, you and me will stop this love drought
