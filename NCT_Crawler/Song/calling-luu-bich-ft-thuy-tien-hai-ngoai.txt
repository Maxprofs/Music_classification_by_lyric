                        Bài hát: Calling - Lưu Bích, Thủy Tiên (Hải Ngoại)

The sun is going down on me
As she surrenders to the sea
So steal the night and fly with me
I'm calling, I'm calling
The moon is high on me and you
Is my message breaking through
Darkened skies that once were blue are falling
So hear me now
Calling out your name
Burning on the flame
Play the waiting game
Hear my calling, hear my calling
Forever, and ever
Through distant lands and mountain streams
My river's running through your dreams
There's an ocean in between
Forever, and ever
Chasing shadows through the years
I whisper softly to my dear
Be sure to know that I am here
Forever
Cal ling out your name (I wish that could come true)
Burning on the flame (I'm reaching out to you) Play the waiting game
Hear my calling, hear my calling
Whipsers in the air (I dream you into life)
Hear a lovers prayer (I pray for you tonight)
I can feel you there
Hear my calling, hear my calling
No man is an island
That's an empty sin
Discovery is a journey
Just have to let me in
Calling out your name (I wish that could come true)
Burning on the flame (Reaching out to you)
Played the waiting game
Calling out your name (I wish that could come true)
Burning on the flame (Reaching out to you)
Play the waiting game
Hear my calling, hear my calling
Whipsers in the air (I dream you in my life)
Hear a lovers prayer (I pray for you tonight)
I can feel you there
Hear my calling, hear my calling
No man is an island (I wish that could come true)
That's an empty sin (I'm reaching out to you)
So steal the night and fly with me I'm calling
Hear my calling.
