(Miley Cyrus)
I'm gonna put on my dancing shoes
And find a crazy outfit
Cause tonight it's all about you
I can't wait to show you all my new moves
I got a brand new 2 step
You gonna like this outfit
I got it all right here
No need for you to go anywhere anywhere anywhere anywhere

Turn it up until you can't rock anymore
Mr. DJ - look at what you made me do out on the floor
That's what we say

(Chorus)
Hey, Hey
We belong to the music
We don't answer to you
Hey, Hey
That's right we ain't moving
We don't answer to you
It's a party we can dance if we want to
C,mon and party like it ain't no curfew
Hey, Hey
We belong to the music
We don't answer to you

(Miley Cyrus)
I'm gonna call up my friends
Gonna have a good time
It's sure to be crazy
Tonight, it's all about us
Feeling real good, can you blame me?
I got a brand new hairdo.
With it my brand new attitude.
You can't tell me nothin'
I ain't bluffing
I'm telling you
Telling you
Telling you
Telling you

Turn it up until you can't rock anymore
Mr. DJ - look at what you made me do out on the floor
That's what we say

(Chorus)
Hey, Hey
We belong to the music
We don't answer to you
Hey, Hey
That's right we ain't moving
We don't answer to you
It's a party we can dance if we want to
C,mon and party like it ain't no curfew
Hey, Hey
We belong to the music
We don't answer to you

(Timbaland & Miley Cyrus)
What what you say now

What what what you say now
People in the party can't get enough
What what what you say now
We gon keep on dancing till the sun comes up
What what what you say now
People in the party can't get enough
Ahhh!!!

(Chorus)
Hey, Hey
We belong to the music
We don't answer to you
Hey, Hey
That's right we ain't moving
We don't answer to you
It's a party we can dance if we want to
C,mon and party like it ain't no curfew
Hey, Hey
We belong to the music
We don't answer to you

(Timbaland & Miley Cyrus)

Wander what; they wander watchu watchu say now
People in the party can't get enough

Watchu watchu watchu watchu watchu say now
We gon keep on dancing till the sun comes up
Watchu watchu watchu watchu watchu say now
