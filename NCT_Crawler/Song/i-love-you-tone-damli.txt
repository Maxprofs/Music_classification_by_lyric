                        Bài hát: I Love You - Tone Damli

I have been looking for pieces of what we shattered
I have been touching the parts i could find together
And I am starting to see traces, baby.

I know you know i've been waiting for you to call me,
You know i know you got problems with say, im sorry,
That i am a step away from crazy, baby.

I love you, me and my heart have decided,
I love you, nothing worth doin' about it
Cause beby when i need you here to hold it all together,
I love you, me and my heart have been fighted,
she wont do anymore beating without you,
we need you, i love you.

You said somethings but i know they was said in anger,
and i dont wanna be mad at you anylonger,
so i am drawing up an line now, baby.

And I have tried to be stronger, without you here,
but i got memories i cant erase, i keep on picturing your face, so,
i stop pretending that im fine now, baby.

I love you, me and my heart have decided,
I love you, nothing worth doin' about it,
Cause baby when i need you here to hold it all together
I love you, me and my heart have been fighted,
she wont do anymore beating without you,
we need you, i love you.

I cant get it right at all, nothing works when you are gone,
I cant sleep at night without you here,
And its crazy but I dont care, cuz..

I love you, me and my heart have decided,
I love you, nothing worth doin' about it,
Cause baby when i need you here to hold it all together
I love you, me and my heart have been fighted,
she wont do anymore beating without you,
we need you, i love you.
