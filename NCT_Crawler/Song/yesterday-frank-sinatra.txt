                        Yesterday, all my troubles seemed so far away
 Now they look as though they're here to stay
 Oh, I believe in yesterday, oh, I believe in yesterday Suddenly I'm not half the man I used to be
 There's a shadow hanging over me
 Oh, yesterday came suddenly Why she had to go I don't know
 She wouldn't say
 I said something wrong
 Now I long for yesterday Yesterday, love was such an easy game to play
 Now I need a place to hide away
 Oh, I believe in yesterday I said something wrong
 Now I long for yesterday Yesterday, love was such an easy game to play
 Now I need a place to hide away
 Oh, I believe in yesterday
 Yes, I believe in yesterday
