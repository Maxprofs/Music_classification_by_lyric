                        Verse I:

The last that ever she saw him carried away by a moonlight shadow
he past on worried and warning, carried away by a moonlight shadow.
Lost in a riddle last Saturday Night far away on the other side.
He was caught in the middle of a desperate fight
and she couldn ́t find how to push through.

Chorus:

Moonlight Shadow oh oh Moonlight Shadow carried away by the Moon
Oh oh oh oh Moonlight Shadow oh oh Moonlight Shadow far away...

Verse II:

The Trees that whisper in the evening carried away by a moonlight shadow
Sing a song of sorrow and grieving carried away by a moonlight shadow.
All the saw was a silhouette of a gun, far away on the other side.
He was shot six times by a man on the run 
And she couldn ́t find how to push through.

Verse III:

It was four am in the morning carried away by a moonlight shadow
I watched your vision forming, carried away by a moonlight shadow
Stardust glowing in a silvery night, far away on the other side
Will you come to talk to me this night and she couldn ́t find how to push through.

Bridge:

I stay, I pray I see you in heaven far away
I stay, I pray I see you in heaven one day
                        
                    |
