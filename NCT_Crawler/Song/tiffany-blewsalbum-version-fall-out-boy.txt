                        I'm not a crybaby
 I'm the crybaby
 A caterpillar that got stuck
 Mr. Moth come quick with any luck
 A long walk to a dark house
 A Roman candle heart keep us far apart
 I'm cocktail party doing alright
 Hate me baby, maybe I'm a piece of art

 Oh, my friends all lie and say
 They only want the best wishes for me
 Oh, 3 2 1
 We go live... 

 Oh, baby you're a classic
 Like a little black dress
 You're a faded moon
 Stuck on a little hot mess (little hot mess)
 Woah, woah
 And oh, baby you're a classic
 Like a little black dress
 But you'll be faded soon
 Stuck on a little hot mess (little hot mess)
 Woah, woah

 I can make your heart slow
 I can feel the weather in my bones
 Wish hard enough, I can turn it to what I like
 Your pupils they're big
 They're rolling like dice
 They say they only want the best wishes for me
 (They only want the best for me)
 Oh, 3 2 1
 We go live... 

 Oh, baby you're a classic
 Like a little black dress
 You're a faded moon
 Stuck on a little hot mess (little hot mess)
 Woah, woah
 And oh, baby you're a classic
 Like a little black dress
 But you'll be faded soon
 Stuck on a little hot mess (little hot mess)
 Woah, woah

 Not the boy I was
 The boy I am is just venting, venting
 Dear gravity, you held me down in this starless city
 (X2)

 They say they only want the best wishes for me
 (They only want the best for me)
 Oh, 3 2 1
 We go live... 

 Oh, baby you're a classic
 Like a little black dress
 You're a faded moon
 Stuck on a little hot mess (little hot mess)
 Woah, woah
 And oh, baby you're a classic
 Like a little black dress
 But you'll be faded soon
 Stuck on a little hot mess (little hot mess)
 Woah, woah
 Woah
