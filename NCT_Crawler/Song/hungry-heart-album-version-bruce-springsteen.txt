                        Yeah, come on, ah
 Got a wife and kids in Baltimore, Jack
 I went out for a ride and I never went back
 Like a river that don't know where it's flowin’
 I took a wrong turn and I just kept goin’

 Everybody’s got a hungry heart
 Everybody’s got a hungry heart
 Lay down your money and ya play your part
 Everybody’s got a hungry heart

 I met her in a Kingstown bar
 We fell in love, I knew it had to end
 We took what we had and we ripped it apart
 Now here I am, down in Kingstown, again

 Everybody’s got a hungry heart
 Everybody’s got a hungry heart
 Lay down your money and ya play your part
 Everybody’s got a hungry heart

 (Instrumental Break)

 Everybody needs a place to rest
 Everybody wants to have a home
 Don't make no difference what nobody says
 Ain’t nobody like to be alone

 Oh yeah, everybody’s got a hungry heart
 Everybody’s got a hungry heart
 Lay down your money and ya play your part
 Everybody’s got a hungry heart
 (Everybody’s got a hungry heart)
 Oh, yeah
 (Everybody’s got a hungry heart)
 (Lay down your money and ya play your part)
 Oh, yeah
 (Everybody’s got a hungry heart)
 Oh, yeah, yeah, na, na, na, na, oh, yeah
 Oh, yeah, na, na, na, na, na
 Oh, yeah, mmm, mmm...
