                        I never meant to be the one to let you down
 If anything, I thought I saw myself going first
 I didn't know how to stick around
 How to see anybody but me be getting hurt I keep remembering the summer night
 And the conversation breaking up the mood
 I didn't want to tell you you were right
 Like the season changing, oh, I felt it too Does anybody know
 How to hold my heart
 How to hold my heart?
 'Cause I don't wanna let go
 Let go, let go too soon I want to tell you so
 Before the sun goes dark
 How to hold my heart
 'Cause I don't wanna let go
 Let go, let go of you I'm not the kind to try to tell you lies
 But the truth is you've been hiding from it too
 I see the end sneaking in behind your eyes
 Saying everything no words could ever do Does anybody know
 How to hold my heart
 How to hold my heart?
 'Cause I don't wanna let go
 Let go, let go too soon I want to tell you so
 Before the sun goes dark
 How to hold my heart
 'Cause I don't wanna let go
 Let go, let go of you Is anybody listening?
 'Cause I'm crying
 Is anybody listening? Does anybody know
 How to hold my heart
 How to hold my heart?
 'Cause I don't wanna let go
 Let go, let go too soon I want to tell you so
 Before the sun goes dark
 How to hold my heart
 'Cause I don't wanna let go
 Let go, let go of you Does anybody know
 How to hold my heart
 How to hold my heart?
 'Cause I don't wanna let go
 Let go, let go too soon I want to tell you so
 Before the sun goes dark
 How to hold my heart
 'Cause I don't wanna let go, let go, let go
 I don't wanna let go, let go of you I don't wanna let go
