[Uma:] Huh! Let's get this party started 
I swear I'm cold- hearted
There's no negotiation 
I'm not here for debatin'
You need some motivation?
Just look at Ben's face then
Ask yourself how long you think I'll remain patient
I'll throw him overboard and let him swim with killer sharks 
You either hand over the wand or he'll be ripped apart 

[Mal:] Now let's all just be smart although for you that must be hard 
You'll get your wand, no one has to come to any harm 
Don't try to intimidate, your bark is much worse than your bite 
Who's the baddest of them all? I guess we're finding out tonight 

[Pirate:] Let's go, bring it on, better give us what we want 
It's the wand for the crown, if you don't it's goin' down

[Mal and friends:] Let's go, make your move, peace or war, it's up to you
Give him up and do it now, if you don't it's goin down

[Pirate:] We want the wand, or else the king is gone 
Your time is running out, you should really watch your mouth

[Mal and friends:] Let's go, pound for pound, we're prepared to stand our ground
Put your swords up, put 'em up, it's goin' down 

[Pirate:] Yo-oh, ho-oh, oh-oh! Make the trade!
Yo-oh, ho-oh, oh-oh! Or walk the plank!
Yo-oh, ho-oh, oh-oh! Make the trade!
Yo-oh, ho-oh, oh-oh! Or walk the plank!

[Mal:] Okey, look, this is not a coversation, it's a do or die situation
If you don't give me back the king 
I'll have no hesitation
I'll serve you right here, and you don't need a reservation 
That way your whole pirate crew can have a demonstration
Release him now and we can go our separate ways
Unless you wanna deal with me and the VK's 

[Uma:] So that's your big speech, huh?
An empty ultimatum?

[Harry:] All it take is one swing and I'll humiliate him 
Matter of fact, make one wrong move and I'll debilitate him 
And if even he start to slip, I'll eliminate him 
All it take is one wrong look and I'll 

[Uma:] Harry, we get it, chill 

[Pirate:] Let's go, bring it on, better give us what we want 
It's the wand for the crown, if you don't it's goin' down

[Mal and friends:] Let's go, pound for pound, we're prepared to stand our ground
Put your swords up, put 'em up, it's goin' down 

[Pirate:] We want the wand, or else the king is gone 
Your time is running out, you should really watch your mouth

[Mal and friends:] Let's go, pound for pound, we're prepared to stand our ground
Put your swords up, put 'em up, it's goin' down 

[Ben:] Hey, we don't have to choose 
We don't have to light the fuse 
Mal, whatever you do, it's gonna be a lose-lose 
There's gotta be a better way 
Uma, I promise, I'll give you your chance
You'll have your say 

[Uma:] Silly king, you give me?
You gonna give me your chance 
Well, not a chance 

[Pirate:] Yo-oh, ho-oh, oh-oh! Make the trade!
Yo-oh, ho-oh, oh-oh! Or walk the plank!
Yo-oh, ho-oh, oh-oh! Make the trade!
Yo-oh, ho-oh, oh-oh! Or walk the plank!
