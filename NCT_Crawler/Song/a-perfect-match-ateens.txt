                        (Let the boys sing)
You spend your money on diamonds and pearls
I'd sell my car just to travel the world
I look broke baby - You got flash
But even so we're a perfect match.

You're into fashion, dinners, and art
I know the "South Park Series" by heart
You conversate baby - I talk trash
But even so we're a perfect match.

(Let the girls sing)
We're like night and day - White and black
But what we have is a perfect match
When I say this - You say that
But love comes easy 'cause opposites attract.

(Aaaatract)
You keep your clothes looking crispy and clean (So clean)
I got holes all over my jeans
You love "Grease" baby - I love "Snatch"
But even so we're a perfect match.

We're like night and day - White and black
But what we have is a perfect match
When I say this - You say that
But love comes easy 'cause opposites attraaaaact.

I know - we'll beat the odds together,
We'll keep our love intact - And prove that opposites attract.

(The Girls sing)
Ah-Oh-oh wo-woh.

(The Boys go)
Ah-Oh-oh, oh-oh.

You spend your money on diamonds and pearls
I'd sell my car to travel the world,
You love "Grease" baby - I love "Snatch"
But that would make us a perfect maaaaaaaatch.

We're like night and day - White and black
But what we have is a perfect match -
(We're like) Night and day - White and black
But what we have is a perfect match
When I say this - You say that
But what we have is a perfect match
Like night and day - White and black
([Girls:] Ah oh owh, oh owh [Boys:]Owh) 
But what we have is a perfect match
([Boys:] Ah oh owh, oh owh)
When I say this - You say that
([Girls:] Ah oh owh, oh owh [Boys:]Owh)
But what we have is a perfect match
([Boys:] Ah oh owh, oh owh)
Like night and day - White and black
But what we have is a perfect match
(What we have is a perfect match together)
When I say this - You say that
([Girls:] Ah oh owh, oh owh [Boys:]Owh.)
But love comes easy 'cause opposites attract
([All:] Comes easy 'cause opposites attract)
