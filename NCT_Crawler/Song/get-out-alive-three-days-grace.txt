                        song : Get Out Alive - Three Days Grace

No time for goodbye he said as he faded away
 Don't put your life in someone's hands
 They're bound to steal it away
 Don't hide your mistakes
 'Cause they'll find you, burn you, then he said If you want to get out alive
 Oh, run for your life
 If you want to get out alive
 Oh, run for your life This is my last time she said
 As she faded away
 It's hard to imagine
 But one day you'll end up like me
 Then she said If you want to get out alive
 Oh, run for your life
 If you want to get out alive
 Oh, run for your life If you want to get out alive
 Oh, run for your life
 If you want to get out alive
 Oh, run for your life If I stay, it won't be long
 Till I'm burning on the inside
 If I go, I can only hope
 That I make it to the other side If you want to get out alive
 Oh, run your life
 If you want to get out alive
 Oh, run for If you want to get out alive
 Oh, run for your life
 If you want to get out alive
 Oh, run for If I stay, it won't be long
 Till I'm burning on the inside
 If I go, I can only hope
 That I make it to the other side If I stay, it won't be long
 Till I'm burning on the inside
 If I go, and if I go Burning on the inside
 Burning on the inside
 Burning on the inside
                        
                    |
