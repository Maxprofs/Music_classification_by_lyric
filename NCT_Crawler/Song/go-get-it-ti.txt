                        [Hook]
I gotta grind, won’t stop
Hustle won’t quit
Shine like no other, I be on some other *
I got a high price lifestyle super bad bitch
If I want it, then I got it
If I don’t then all I gotta do is
Go, get it, stay about my bidness
Ball till I fall, floss until I finish
I can go, get it, stay about my bidness
I’m living just to kill it, stacking million to the ceiling

[Verse 1]
Eveyday I ball brown, all I wanna do is ball
Put my money over bitches, put my hustle over all
Louie down to the drawers, Luis Vuitton kicks
Got a man, how to swagger, bitch I’m stupid dumb sick
With a group of young bitches and they stupid dumb thick
I’m the marathon man, all I do is run *
A sophisticated convict, superficial, still official
Multimillion dollar *
Money is the object, hot *
Bitch I got a sawnoff on my arm
See bigger with no diamond
They just talk about they got it,
I’m the upper echelon, though
Bitch I‘m bout that action, you could go on with that convo
I have done more than you dream bout
Get your dream bitch and your dream house
On lean passing them beans out
With a bad crew, the whole team high
Go on boy, get seen by, bro you know me, you know I be
Stacking that dough, that’s all I see
I g.o.g.e.t.i.t.

[Hook]

[Verse 2]
I live life, up late night
Get * fake when I take flight
I get paid, no sick days
My outfit’s so switch blade
Don’t sniff yay, but I blow dro
Bank roll on loco
Still ride with that 44
Don’t let my P-O know
Bad white bitch super thick
I’m Ice T, she Coco
She got another bitch, other bitches
Her ass fat, face so-so, no paper triail
No phone call, no emails, no photos
Just backshot, with that fat butt
And low blow headbutts in slow-mo
Purple label polo and a crew that’s what I do
Man I strive and roll my denim in my new Margiella shoes
Man, we be cool if we just parle
On Margharita Molly and the strong?
We menagin’ for a hobby
We kick it how we kick it
Know you envy how I’m living
Just can’t resist the
Get the million bout my business
Bro you know me, you know I be
Stacking that dough that’s all I see
I g.o.g.e.t.i.t.
