                        Bài hát: My Little Prayer - David Archuleta

Heavenly Father, I am grateful
For your eternal presence
I am learning to be patient 
And that you are really there.

Sometimes I am afraid,
And I know that's lacking faith.
But I'm beginning to understand, 
That for me you have a plan.

Heavenly Father, I am grateful
For you sending your son
To die so that I live
And for never giving up.

I'm learning everyday
That I won't always have my way.
But I'm beginning to understand
That for me you have a plan.

Heavenly Father, I am grateful 
For you hearing my prayer.
I am learning to be patient,
And that you are really there.

There are answers I'm receiving.
No, they're not always immediate.
Sometimes I have felt a feeling,
That's when I kneel down in prayer.

You show me you hear my prayer.
I'm amazed by how you care,

Cause you hear
My little prayer.
                        
                    |
