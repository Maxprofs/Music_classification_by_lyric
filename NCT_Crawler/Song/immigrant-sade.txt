                        Coming from where he did
 He was turned away from
 Every door like Joseph
 To even the toughest among us
 That would be too much He didn't know what it was to be black
 'Til they gave him his change
 But didn't want to touch his hand
 To even the toughest among us
 That would be too much Isn't it just enough?
 How hard it is to live
 Isn't it hard enough?
 Just to make it through a day The secret of their fear and their suspicion
 Standing there, looking like an angel
 In his brown shoes, his short suit
 His white shirt and his cuffs a little frayed Coming from where he did
 He was such a dignified child
 To even the toughest among us
 That would be too much Isn't it just enough?
 How hard it is to live
 Isn't it hard enough?
 Just to make it through a day Coming from where he did
 He was turned away from
 Every door like Joseph
 To even the toughest among us
 That would be too much He didn't know what it was to be black
 'Til they gave him his change
 They didn't want to touch his hand
 To even the toughest among us
 That would be too much
