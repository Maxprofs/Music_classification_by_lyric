                        Tomorrow - Barbra Streisand

The sun will come out tomorrow 
Bet your bottom dollar that tomorrow 
There will be the sun just thinking about tomorrow clears away the cobwebs and the sorrow 
Till there's none 
When I'm stuck with the day that's gray and lonely 
I'll just stick out my chin and grin 
And I'll say the sun will come out tomorrow so you gotta hang on till tomorrow 
Come what may tomorrow tomorrow 
I'll love you tomorrow you're always a day away 
Just a day away 
The sun will come out tomorrow 
Bet your bottom dollar that tomorrow there will be sun just thinking about tomorrow clears away the cobwebs and the sorrow 
Till there's none when I'm stuck with the lady that's grey and lonely 
I'll just stick out my chin and grin 
And I'll say the sun will come out tomorrow so you gotta hang on till tomorrow come what may tomorrow tomorrow 
I love you tomorrow 
You're always a day away just a day away the sun will come out tomorrow so you gotta hang on till tomorrow come what may tomorrow tomorrow 
I love you tomorrow 
You always a day away just a day away you just a day away well well you are just a day away take away my sorrows just a day away 
I know the sun will come out tomorrow yeah just a day away 
It's always shinning 
Well well just a day away to all the fog and pollution
