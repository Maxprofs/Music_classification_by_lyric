                        Bài hát: Flower Dance - DJ Okawari

"They serve the purpose of changing hydrogen into breathable oxygen. 
And they're necessary here as the air is on Earth."
"But I still say they're flowers."
"If you like."
"Do you sell them?"
"I'm afraid not."
"But, maybe we could make a deal."
