Title: Surrender

No more wars to fight
White flags fly tonight
You are out of danger now
Battle field is still
Wild poppies on the hill
Peace can only come
when you surrender

Here the tracers fly
Lighting up the sky
But I'll fight unto the end
Let them send their armies
I will never bend
I won't see you now
till I surrender
I'll see you again
when I surrender

Battle field is still
Wild poppies on the hill
Peace can only come
when you surrender

Here the tracers fly
Lighting up the sky
But I'll fight unto the end
Let them send their armies
I will never bend
I won't see you now
till I surrender
I'll see you again
when I surrender
