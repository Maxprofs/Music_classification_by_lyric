                        Bài hát: Almost (Studio Ver.) - Jessica Jung, SNSD

[Verse 1] 
Can you tell me 
How can one miss what she's never had 
How could I reminisce when there is no past 
How could I have memories of being happy with you boy 
Could someone tell me how can this be 
How could my mind pull up incidents 
Recall dates and times that never happened 
How could we celebrate a love that's to late 
And how could I really mean the words I'm bout to say 

[Chorus] 
I missed the times that we almost shared 
I miss the love that was almost there 
I miss the times that we use to kiss 
At least in my dreams 
Just let me take my time and reminisce 
I miss the times that we never had 
What happened to us we were almost there 
Whoever said it's impossible to miss when you never had 
Never almost had you 

[Verse 2] 
I cannot believe I let you go 
Or what I should say I should've grabbed you up and never let you go 
I should've went out with you 
I should've made you my boo boy 
Yes that's one time I should've broke the rules 
I should've went on a date 
Should've found a way to escape 
Should've turned a almost into 
If it happened now its to late 
How could I celebrate a love that wasn't real 
And if it didn't happen why does my heart feel 

[Chorus] 
I missed the times that we almost shared 
I miss the love that was almost there 
I miss the times that we use to kiss 
At least in my dreams 
Just let me take my time and reminisce 
I miss the times that we never had 
What happened to us we were almost there 
Whoever said it's impossible to miss when you never had 
Never almost had you
