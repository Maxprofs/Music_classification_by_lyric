                        Bài hát: Christmas Day - Dido

A young gentleman came riding past on a snow blue winter's day
He asked to drink by our fire and I was pleased to let him stay
He drank there quietly for a while and then he turned and said to me

"Your eyes are green like summer grass
Your lips are red like a fresh cut rose
Your hair is soft like an Irish stream
And your voice is filled with sweet beauty"

And the last words I heard him say were
"I shall return for you my love on Christmas day"

And the night will come but I won't sleep as I watch the stars that lead him
I cannot place where he is but still my heart goes with him
I'm saving all my Sunday clothes for the day that I'll be leaving

Father knows
My sister knows
And my friends
They're happy for me
And the priest he says
"You should thank God for the blessing of such beauty"

And the last words I heard him say were
"I shall return for you my love on Christmas day"
"I shall return for you my love on Christmas day"

("On Christmas day")
("I shall return for you my love")

And the last words I heard him say were
The last words I ever heard him say
"I shall return for you my love on Christmas day"

"I swear I will return on Christmas day"

"And yes"
"I shall return on Christmas day"

"I shall return for you on Christmas day"

"My love"
"I will return on Christmas day"

"I shall return"
"My love"
"On Christmas day"

"On Christmas day"
