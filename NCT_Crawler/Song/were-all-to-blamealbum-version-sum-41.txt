                        Take everything left from me
 All
 To
 Blame

 How can we still succeed
 Taking what we don't need?
 Telling Lies,
 Alibis,
 Selling all the hate that we breed
 Super-size our tragedy
 (You can't defy me
 Or justify greed)
 Bought in the land of the free

 And we're all to blame
 We've gone too far
 From pride to shame
 We're trying so hard
 But dying in vain.
 We're hopelessly blissful and blind
 To all we are
 We want it all
 With no sacrifice

 Realize
 We spend our lives
 Living in a culture of fear
 Saying "Thanks
 We salute you, thanks"
 To the man of the year.

 How did we all come to this?
 (You can't defy me
 Or justify greed)
 This greed that we just can't just resist

 And we're all to blame
 We've gone too far
 From pride to shame
 We're trying so hard
 But dying in vain
 We're hopelessly blissful and blind
 To all we are
 We want it all
 Everyone
 Wants it all
 With no Sacrifice

 Tell me now
 What have we done
 We don't know
 Can't allow
 What is being done
 To people now
 Leave me now
 We have no choice left
 With our backs against the wall

 And now we're all to blame
 We've gone too far
 From pride to shame
 We're hopelessly blissful and blind
 When all we need
 Is something true
 To believe
 Don't we all
 Everyone?
 Everyone
 We will fall
 Cause we're all to blame
 We've gone too far
 From pride to shame
 We're trying so hard
 But dying in vain
 We want it all
 Everyone
 Don't we all?
                        
                    |
