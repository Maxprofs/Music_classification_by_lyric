                        Bài hát: This Masquerade - Karen Carpenter

Are we really happy
With this lonely game we play?
Looking for the right words to say
Searching but not finding understanding anyway
We're lost in this masquerade

Both afraid to say we're just too far away
From being close together from the start

We tried to talk it over but the words got in the way
We're lost inside this lonely game we play

Thoughts of leaving disappear
Each time I see your eyes
And no matter how hard I try
To understand the reason why we carry on this way
We're lost in this masquerade

We tried to talk it over but the words got in the way
We're lost inside this lonely game we play

Thoughts of leaving disappear
Each time I see your eyes
And no matter how hard I try
To understand the reason why we carry on this way
We're lost in a masquerade
We're lost in a masquerade

(and we're lost in a masquerade)
                        
                    |
