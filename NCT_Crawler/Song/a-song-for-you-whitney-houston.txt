A Song For You
Whitney Houston

I've been so many places
In my life and time
I've sung a lot of songs
And I made some bad rhyme

I've acted out my life in stages
With ten thousand people watching
Well , but we're alone now
And I'm singing this song to you

I know your image of me
Is what I hope to be
I've treated you unkindly
But darling can't you see

There's no one more important to me
Baby, can't you see through me
We're alone now
And I'm singing this song to you

You taught me precious secrets
Of the truth withholding nothing
You came out in front
When I was hiding

But now I'm so much better
And if my words don't come together
Listen to the melody
'Cause my love is in there hiding

I love you in a place
Where there's no space or time
I love you for my life
Then you are a friend of mine

And when my life is over
Remember when we were together (together)
We were alone
And I was singing this song for you

This song for you
This song this song
This song for you
This song this song
This song for you
This song this song
This song for you you you you......

I love you in place
My dear friend ,
where there's no space or time
I love you for my life
You are a friend of mine

And when my life is over
Remember when we were together
We were alone
And I was singing this song to you

Singing this song to you
Singing this song to you
Singing this song
I will sing this song for you
