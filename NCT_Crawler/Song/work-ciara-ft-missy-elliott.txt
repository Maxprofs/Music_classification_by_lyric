Singer: Ciara, Missy Elliott

When the song come on in the club
 Put it up, put it up, put it up
 Turn it up, turn it up, turn it up
 Turn it up, turn it up When the song come on in the club
 Put it up, put it up, put it up
 Turn it up, turn it up, turn it up
 Turn it up, turn it up, let's go The dance train is coming back again
 Extravaganza, you should run and tell a friend
 Kings and queens are posted at the bar
 Buckin' down, it's time to take it all Walk that walk
 Show me how you move it
 Can you walk that talk?
 Put some snap into it It's your chance now
 Girl, you better dance now
 It's your time to show it all
 The spotlight is on you, you better
 (Let's go!) Work, work, work, work
 Work, work, work, work
 Work, work, work, work
 Work, work, you better work Work, work, work, work
 Work, work, work, work
 Work, work, work, work
 Work, work, you better work You better shake that thang like a donkey
 And go hard for it, you better work
 You better swing from a pole like a monkey
 And go hard for it, you better work 'Cause big girls get down on the flo'
 And make it jiggle, jiggle, jiggle, you know, you know
 Ain't no shame, it's the name of game
 Now everybody down to the flo', here we go We got the rhythm of the beat
 We got the rhythm of the beat
 We got the rhythm of the hands
 Let's get the rhythm of the feet Jump in, jump out
 Jump in, jump out
 Jump in, jump out
 Jump in, jump out, here we go Walk that walk
 Show me how you move it and you
 Can you walk that talk?
 Put some snap into it It's your chance now
 Girl, you better dance now
 It's your time to show it all
 The spotlight is on you, you better
 (Let's go!) Work, work, work, work
 Work, work, work, work
 Work, work, work, work
 Work, work, you better work Work, work, work, work
 Work, work, work, work
 Work, work, work, work
 Work, work, you better work When the song come on in the club
 Put it up, put it up, put it up
 Turn it up, turn it up, turn it up
 Turn it up, turn it up When a song start to play, tell the DJ
 (Back it up)
 And if you want the dance floor, you tell the DJ
 (Back it up) This your jam, this your joy, hey, Mr. DJ
 (Back it up)
 This that new Ciara, yo, holla at the DJ
 (Back it up) Now, drop down, everybody in the club, drop down
 Jiggle it, jiggle it, drop 'til it, drop 'til it
 Drop all the way, all the way down to the ground We in the club, and the club don't stop
 When the song come on, don't stop
 Me and C, we gon' go berserk
 All the ladies on the floor, you better work There's 'bout to be a fight in this club
 A fight in this club
