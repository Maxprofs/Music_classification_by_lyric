                        Bài hát: Heart Of Gold - Birdy

I can be strong when I want to be
You think I'm weak cause' you can tear me apart
With the words you speak
You think you're in control
But you don't understand how much you were wrong
You choose to lash out at me
I've done nothing wrong
All you crave is attention and just to beloved
You need to be loved

Lyrics:

And I want to be free when my heart is made from gold
And forgiveness seems too bold
I still find it in my heart
To say "I love you"
When my heart is made from gold
And the hunt is just too bold
I still find it in my hear
To say " I love you"

Is there not enough to use your love for me
To get passed the things because you envy and hate
And the fires that they break
To say "I looked on the smalls"
Can't understand why you don't have it all
And you don't know how to fight for your "believe in your aims"
I just want to do right by you, forget what has changed
Cause' nothing has changed

Repeat lyrics

But you don't have to be so mean
You're such a drama queen
The way you play on every weakness that you see in me
To make you strong
You're all alone
So don't pretend that you can hardly breath
Likes it's down to me
Cause it's so unfair that you can't succeed
But you're so wrong
We're still so young

Repeat lyrics
