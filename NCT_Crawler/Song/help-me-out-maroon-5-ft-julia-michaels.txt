                        Bài hát: Help Me Out - Maroon 5, Julia Michaels

I'm getting kinda over this
I need a metamorphosis
Are you as weak as me?
If not, do you want to be?

I need some type of temporary saving
I need some, some uncomplicated

Help me out
'Cause I don't wanna do this on my own
Help me out, out
Help me out, 'cause I need someone to calm me down
Help me out, out

I don't mean to bother you
But there's something that I want from you
Distract me from thinking too much
Loose ends all tied up with a touch

I need some type of temporary saving
I need some, some uncomplicated

Help me out
'Cause I don't wanna do this on my own
Help me out, out
Help me out, 'cause I need someone to calm me down
Help me out, out

Hey, hey I know that there will come a day
When you, you'll need somebody to–
Hey, hey I know that there will come a day
When you, you'll need somebody to–
Help you out
Help me out
Help me out
Help me out, out

Help me out
'Cause I don't wanna do this on my own
Help me out, out
Help me out, 'cause I need someone to calm me down
Help me out, out

And, hey I know that there will come a day
When you, you'll need somebody to–
Hey, hey I know that there will come a day
When you, you'll need somebody to–
Help you out
Help me out
Help me out
Help me out, out
