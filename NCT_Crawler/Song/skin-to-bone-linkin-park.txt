                        Skin to bone, steel to rust
Ash to ashes dust to dust
Will tomorrow have it's way
with the promises we made
Skin to Bone, steel to rust. 

Ash to ashes, dust to dust
Your deception, my disgust
When your name is finally drawn, 
I'll be happy that you're gone
Ash to ashes, dust to dust.

Chorus:
(aaah ) Ash to ashes, dust to dust
(aaah) Skin to bone and steel to rust

Right to left, left to right
Night to day and day to night
As the starlight fades to gray,
I'll be watching far away
Right to left and left to right

Chorus:
(aaah ) Ash to ashes, dust to dust
(aaah) Skin to bone and steel to rust

Will tomorrow have it's way?
Will the darkness, it betray?
Skin to bone and steel to rust (x3)
                        
                    |
