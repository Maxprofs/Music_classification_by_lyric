                        Bài hát: Lights And Camera - Yuna

Lights
Camera
Struck a pose
And if someone help you
Lipstick on
Yeah

High heels higher
Six feet tall
And everybody knows
Who you are

And nobody cares
If your heart is aching
Nobody cares
If you want no more

Nobody wants to know
You cried the night before

Vaster your dreams and your hopes
Into it
Everything you used to know
Is gone
And you're slipping into in your own

Trying not to lose yourself

Cos these lights won't kill me now
Saying these clothes won't change me now
Saying these words won't scare me now
Saying I will be myself
I will be myself

Friendly people
All around
And time to put
Your best face on
Yeah

Smiling like there's
Nothing wrong
Though deep down you feel
So alone

Nobody sees who you are inside
Nobody knows you are so much more

Nobody needs to know
You're tired of putting a show

Vaster your dreams and your hopes
Into it
Everything you used to know
Is gone
And you're slipping into in your own

Trying not to lose yourself

Saying these lights won't kill me now
Saying these clothes won't change me now
Saying these words won't scare me now
Saying I will be myself

Cos these lights won't kill me now
Saying these clothes won't change me now

Saying these words won't scare me now
Saying I will be myself
I will be myself

Nobody cares
If your heart is aching
Nobody cares
If you want no more

Nobody wants to know
Nobody cares at all

Saying these lights won't kill me now
Saying these clothes won't change me now
Saying these words won't scare me now
Saying I will be myself
I want be myself [x3]
