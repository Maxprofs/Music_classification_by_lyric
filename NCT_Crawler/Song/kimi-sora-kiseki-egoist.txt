Nhạc Nhật|

                        Kimi ni fureta toki
Takanaru kodou ga kikoeta
Hajimete shitta no
Omoi wa chikara ni naru tte
Hoshikuzu chiribameta sora ni
Kimi he todoke to negau
Watashi no uta kikoemasu ka?
——————————————
When you touch
I heard a throbbing beat
First i,
The feelings I would be a force
The sky was sprinkled stardust
Delivered to you and hope:
Can you hear my song?
——————————————
I love you forever
Saigo ni iezu ni ita
Imasara dakedo tsutaetai omoi ga aru
I love you nando mo
Nando demo kiite hoshii
Kimi wo aishiteru kara
——————————————
I love you forever
Which we did not say at the end
But now there is a feeling I want to tell
I love you more than once
Want to hear again and again
Because I love you
——————————————
Mamoru mono nante nan ni mo
Nai hazu datta no ni
Kimi no sonzai ga watashi wo okubyou ni saseta
Nakushita kimochi ga sukoshizutsu
Modorihajimete kite kou iu nda
Futari nara kitto
——————————————
I shall defend anything
It was supposed to be not
You were the presence of cowardice is to me
Little by little, feeling lost
I say it has started to return
Surely if two people
——————————————
I love you forever
Saigo ni iezu ni ita
Imasara dakedo tsutaetai omoi ga aru
I love you nando mo
Nando demo kiite hoshii
Kimi wo aishiteru kara
——————————————
I love you forever
Which we did not say at the end
Have the courage to want to convey feelings
So I love you
Trying to kiss many times
Because I love you
——————————————
Sayonara ga oshiete kureta
Futari meguriaeta
Sore tte kiseki nanda ne
Kitto
——————————————
Told me goodbye
Meet two people were visiting
What a miracle I’m sure it
——————————————
I love you forever
Saigo ni kimi ni iou
Koushite futari
Katayosete irareru uchi ni
I love you nando mo
Nando demo tsutawaru made
Kimi wo aishiteru
Sayonara mata aeru
Koushite futari
Itsu no hi datte hitomi to tojireba
Omoidaseru yo
I love you dakara
Mou nido to furimukanai
Kimi ga soba ni iru kara
Kimi wo aishiteru

Thus two people
Be well within the shoulder quick guide to the top

To travel as many times

So I love you
Do not look back anymore
Because you are near
