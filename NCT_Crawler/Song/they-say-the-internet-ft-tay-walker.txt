                        They say that every day is a struggle
 and it takes time,
 but do they do they have a clue?
 How do i do i tell the truth from a lie now?
 They try to say hello it's goodbye tomorrow
 Throw a little "kush" up in the bowl
 You'll be all right
 You'll be all right Just think if things were perfect
 would it be worth it if even at all
 So don't act like you can't take it
 we were built to be greatness
 you can weather the storm I know how easy (I know how easy)
 it is to give up (it is easy give up)
 but don't let people (don't let people)
 hold you down (hold you down)
 and I know sometimes (I know sometimes)
 that it will amaze you (that it will amaze you)
 but don't let it fade you (don't let it fade you)
 hold your ground (hold your ground) hmm
 they say they say hmm
 they say they say hmm
 they say they say hmm Why do we judge does we don't know?
 There's no need to hide
 You know what's inside
 Why do we hate when there's love to spare?
 Why don't we understand
 that the only way to grow is with love Just think if things were perfect
 would it be worth it if even at all
 So don't act like you can't take it
 we were built to be greatness
 you can weather the storm I know how easy (I know how easy)
 it is to give up (it is easy give up)
 but don't let people (don't let people)
 hold you down (hold you down)
 and I know sometimes (I know sometimes)
 that it will amaze you (that it will amaze you)
 but don't let it fade you (don't let it fade you)
 hold your ground (hold your ground) hmm
 they say they say hmm
 they say they say hmm
 they say they say hmm
