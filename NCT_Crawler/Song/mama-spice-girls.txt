                        Mama lyrics

She used to be my only enemy and never let me free,Catching me in places that I know I shouldn't be,Every other day I crossed the line,I didn't mean to be so bad, I never thought you would become the friend I never had. Back then I didn't know why, why you were misunderstood, So now I see through your eyes, all that you did was love,Mama I love you, Mama I care, Mama I love you, Mama my friend, My friend I didn't want to hear it then but I'm not ashamed to say it now,Every little thing you said and did was right for me,I had a lot of time to think about,about the way I used to be,Never had a sense of my responsibility. Back then I didn't know why, why you were misunderstood,So now I see through your eyes,all that you did was love,Mama I love you, Mama I care, Mama I love you, Mama my friend, My friendBut now I'm sure I know why,why you were misunderstood,So now I see through your eyes,all I can give you is love,Mama I love you, Mama I care,Mama I love you, Mama my friend,My friendMama I love you, Mama I care,Mama I love you, Mama my friend,You're my friend
