                        Bài hát: All That Jazz (Glee Cast Version Feat. Kate Hudson) - Glee Cast

Come on babe
Why don't we paint the town?
And all that Jazz
I'm gonna rouge my knees
And roll my stockings down
And all that jazz
Start the car
I know a whoopee spot
Where the gin is cold
But the piano's hot
It's just a noisy hall
Where there's a nightly brawl
And all
That
Jazz

Skidoo!

And all that Jazz

Hotcha! Whoopee!

And all that jazz

Ha!
Ha!
Ha!

Slick your hair
And wear your buckle shoes
And all that Jazz
I hear that Father Dip
Is gonna blow the blues
And all that Jazz
Hold on, hon
We're gonna bunny hug
I bought some aspirin
Down at United Drug
In case you shake apart
And want a brand new start
To do that
...Jazz

Find a flask
We're playing fast and loose
And all that jazz

Right up here
Is where I store the juice
And all that jazz

Come on, babe
We're gonna brush the sky
I bet you luck Lindy
Never flew so high
'Cause in the stratosphere
How could he lend an ear
to all that Jazz?

Oh, you're gonna see your sheba shimmy shake

And all that jazz

Oh, she's gonna shimmy 'till her garters break

And all that jazz

Show her where to park her girdle
Oh, her mother's blood'd curdle

If she'd hear her baby's queer

For all

that

Jazz
All that Jazz

Come on, babe
Why Don't we paint
The town?
And all that Jazz (And all that Jazz)

I'm gonna
Rouge my knees
And roll my
Stockings down
And all that jazz (And all that Jazz)

Start the car
I know a whoopee spot
Where the gin is cold
But the piano's hot

It's just a noisy hall
Where there's a nightly brawl

And all that

Jazz

No, I'm no one's wife

But, Oh, I love my life

And all that Jazz!

That Jazz!
