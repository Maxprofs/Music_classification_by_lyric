                        Okay I'm Rambo I ramshack
 I'm next to that cheese like rat traps
 On top of that green like grass ass
 That's over y'all head like snapbacks
 I get it where I fit in, put up then I put in
 Tryna find an ass I can put my *** foot in
 Run this *** no I run this ***
 Don't give one *** bitch I done this ***
 I did what I say I did
 Did not fabricate one bit
 I have been the *** realest since my exit near the clit'
 That's where I was born *** what you on
 All about me bitch *** what you doin'
 Round of applause bitches happy with some garbage
 Show my whole *** ass like a fat bitch in chaps
 But I'll be running that *** like a mother***in' tracker
 Like I run on sense like a mother***in' chopper
 Like a cheetah in the jungle but I'm mother*** faster
 Like a pre-teen boy in the church with a pastor
 Hold up I'm not serious I'm just playin' psych
 *** your opinion bitch I mean it when I'm sayin' that Money and more money is the only *** I'm after
 You can cut the fake ***
 I'm not a mother***in' actor
 I'm on top of my green like a mother*** tractor
 You niggas you 'bout to be bitches you bitches 'bout to be Casper I'll be on that other *** got that from my other bitch
 She come from an island or a desert or some tundra ***
 I am multi-faceted, bitch I do a ton of ***
 Like I'm diarrhea or whatever sitting under it
 I'm nasty, I'm insane, I'm too much, I spit grains
 I came from the ***in' bottom
 I'm top now, I shift lanes,
 I kick ***, like dope ***
 Like no ***, like oh ***
 Get in my way I *** up everything
 Like ho ***, see, they said that I wouldn't
 I do whatever they said I couldn't
 I'm not the one to be ***ed with
 Or to be tough with
 I be on your head like duck, duck, duck bitch
 I be in the air like pump-pumped up fists
 Nah, I'm like up-chuck like gut fish like hands up my skirt
 Like when you gon' let me *** bitch (Hold up) Money and more money is the only *** I'm after
 You can cut the fake ***
 I'm not a mother***in' actor
 I'm on top of my green like a mother*** tractor
 You niggas you 'bout to be bitches you bitches 'bout to be Casper I'm an undefeated ***
 My tongue is the *** rapture, bitch
 I be at my peak, I am not the one to be mastered
 I'm the one to be after, I'm sweeping you while I'm dusting
 I just popped up out the blue, I'm spontaneously combusting
 Spit a little different, give me just a minute
 Beat the beat down bitch, fresh it then I kill it
 We are not the same but they don't really get it
 Tell 'em do the math, hoe, fraction, division
 Sick flow sick ho, drop me in the clinic
 Eat 'em 'til the end 'til they back at the beginning
 Cause I ki-ki-ki-kill it 'til it's flat dead
 And never pass a rock like a mother*** crackhead Money and more money is the only *** I'm after
 You can cut the fake ***
 I'm not a mother***in' actor
 I'm on top of my green like a mother*** tractor
 You niggas you 'bout to be bitches you bitches 'bout to be Casper Bitch
