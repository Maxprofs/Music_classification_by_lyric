                        Bài hát: Medusa - Kailee Morgue

There's blood in the water, and they're coming to bring me down 
What's hope with no gavious 
Yeah there's no one in this ghost town 
She looked right through me, and I turned to stone 
Medusa, Medusa, I've been here alone 

And I crumble to pieces, my body my weakness is on the floor
And the wind will blow and blow and I won't be here no more
My wishing well has run dry, stars are dying in the sky
So I'll shed my blood and tears, I'll show no fear just to survice
She looked right through me, and I turned to stone 
Oh Medusa, Medusa, I've been here alone

She says mortal one you've been chosen 
You're beautiful but you're broken
So hold on to this moment
And fight until you're hopeless
There's secrets and riddles that live in these walls 
There's ghosts of part heroes and I hear them call my name

We won't be tamed
She looked right through me, and I turned to stone 
Medusa, Medusa, I've been here alone
She looked right through me, and I turned to stone 
Oh Medusa, Medusa, I've been here alone
                        
                    |
