                        Bài hát: Keeping A Secret - Bleachers

And oh God, it's a long walk home
But I understand why I walk alone
Cause hey, we keep it a secret
And in your car it's an endless dream
Of ways we could keep this feeling clean
But hey, we're keeping a secret

[Pre-Chorus]
All my guts
Push me out
Onto your front stoop
Oh, and oh my god, I've changed myself
To what we might do (if we stop keeping a secret)

[Chorus]
One more dance, one more night
Hanging on for bitter moonlight
They can't change what we started
If we stop keeping a secret
I can't let go
All your pictures on my phone
All your clothes are in my bedroom
What if we stop keeping a secret?

[Post-Chorus]
What if we stop keeping a secret?
What if we stop keeping a secret?

[Verse 2]
Woke up to the pain I feel
When I place my bets on your winding wheel
But hey, let's keep it a secret
And what a choice to choose to be held
By somebody who slips in and out of themselves
Oh wait, hard keeping a secret

[Pre-Chorus]
All my guts
Push me out
Sat on your front stoop
Oh, and oh my god, I've changed myself
To what we might do (if we stop keeping a secret)

[Chorus]
One more dance
One more night
Hanging on for bitter moonlight
They can't change what we started
If we start keeping a secret
I can't let go
All your pictures on my phone
All your clothes are in my bedroom
What if we stop keeping a secret?


[Post-Chorus]
What if we stop keeping a secret?
What if we stop keeping a secret?

[Verse 3: Spoken]
Fade into memory
Cause I think about you
Like this piece of you that's right there but I cannot grab you
As we fade into my mind (fade into memory)
And I torture myself
Wondering if you’re doing exactly what I’m doing:
Imagining (imagining)
(I torture myself)
(wondering)
                        
                    |
