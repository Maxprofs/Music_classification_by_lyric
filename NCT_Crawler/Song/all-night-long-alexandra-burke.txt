Alexandra Burke - All Night Long

(Uh-ho) (Oooo) (Oh-noo)

I see everybody around,
But it feels like we're in private,
I know you want me so bad,
'Cause you just can't seem to hide it.

Them lights are movin' to the rhythmn of the music,
When we're together, everything just comes together baby.
So inspired by the moment we can lose it,
I hope you're ready...

As long as i see the stroke lights im dancing all night long,
When we're together baby,
I'm feeling alright you got me all night long,
So tell the dj play it.
(all night long x4)
So tell the dj play it,
(all night long x4)

So tell the dj play it,
Tonight the admission is free,
Now we're shutting the club down.
We're moving out to the streets,
All we got left is love now.

Feel my troubles pounding to the rhythmn of your heartbeat,
When we're together, everything just comes together baby.
Every motion calls your name,
Every excuse on me.

And i hope you're ready,
As long as i see the stroke lights im dancing all night long,
When we're together baby,
I'm feeling alright you got me all night long,
So tell the dj play it.
(all night long x4)
So tell the dj play it.
(all night long x4)

So tell the dj play it,
Forget all my worries now,
Need to put the past behind.
Unless this worlds in a hurry no,
We stand still in time.

Them lights are movin' to the rhythmn of the music,
When we're together, everything just comes together baby.
So inspired by the moment we can lose it,
And I hope you're ready...

As long as i see the stroke lights im dancing all night long,
When we're together baby,
I'm feeling alright you got me all night long,
So tell the dj play it.
(all night long x6)
So tell the dj play it.
(all night long x6)
So tell the dj play it.

It's only you and me together,
And this feeling's so strong.
Wish i could stay like this forever, all night long.
(all night long x6)
(all night long x6)
