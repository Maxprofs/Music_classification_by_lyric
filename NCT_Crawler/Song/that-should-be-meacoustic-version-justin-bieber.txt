                        [Verse 1]
 Everybody's laughing in my mind
 Rumors spreadin' 'bout this other guy
 Do you do what you did when you did with me, 
 Does he love you the way I can?
 Did you forget all the plans that you made with me
 Cause baby I didn't

 [Chorus]
 That should be me holding your hand
 That should be me making you laugh
 That should be me this is so sad
 That should be me that should be me
 That should be me feeling your kiss
 That should be me buying you gifts
 This is so wrong
 I can't go on
 'Til you believe that
 That should be me
 That should be me
 (Verse 2)
 You said you needed a little time for my mistakes
 It's funny how you used that time to have me replaced
 Did you think that I wouldn't see you out at the movies
 What you doin' to me
 You're taking him where we used to go
 Now if you're tryin' to break my heart
 It's working cause you know that

 [Chorus]
 That should be me holding your hand
 That should be me making you laugh
 That should be me this is so sad
 That should be me that should be me
 That should be me feeling your kiss
 That should be me buying you gifts
 This is so wrong
 I can't go on
 'Till you believe
 That should be me

 [Bridge]
 I need to know should I fight for love
 Or disarm
 It's getting harder to shield
 It's breaking my heart

 Ooooh, ohhh
 That should be me holding your hand
 That should be me making you laugh
 That should be me this is so sad
 That should be me that should be me
 That should be me feeling your kiss
 That should be me buying you gifts
 This is so wrong
 I can't go on
 'Till you believe
 That that should be me(Holding your hand)
 That should be me
 (The one making you laugh) (oh baby oh)
 That should be me
 That should be me
 (Taking you flowers)
 That should be me
 (Talking for hours oh)
 That should be me
 That should be me
 That should be me
 Never should've let you go, I never should've let you go
 That should be me, I never should've let you go
 That should be me
                        
                    |
