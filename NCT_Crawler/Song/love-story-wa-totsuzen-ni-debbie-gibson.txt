Âu Mỹ khác|

                        Before this magic night falls and fades away
I've got to find the words to steal your heart away
You're such a vision
Oh baby, listen
I may be puttin' it all on the line
I get so weak when I look into your eyes
I feel the heat baby
I must be hypnotized
But if I could
Well, we both know I would
Stop the hands of time
Here tonight

It seemed when I met you
We'd been here before
That I didn't forget you
On some other shore
Fate was my friend
'Cause she brought you again
Now here you are in my arms suddenly

My heart is blind to other eyes
It just sees you
It couldn't fool me even if I wanted it to
Your love has saved me
Your smile is sacred
I want to is be with you all my life
There is no fantasy, oh no, not anymore
You're much more real to me
Than anything before
Now that you're here
Well it all seems clear
I'm gonna take the fall
Take it all

Love is forever
As free as the wind
The nothing else matters
When it comes again
Time is my friend
'Cause she brought you again
Now here you are in my arms

It seemed when I met you
We'd been here before
That I didn't forget you
On some other shore
Fate was my friend
'Cause she brought you again
Now here you are in my arms suddenly

My love is in motion tonight
And it's time to set it free
'Cause you're the one
The only one
Who could deliver me
Your love is an ocean of fire
When you take me to my need
That I will remember
For all eternity

Love is forever
As free as the wind
The nothing else matters
When it comes again
Time is my friend
'Cause she brought you again
Now here you are in my arms

It seemed when I met you
We'd been here before
That I didn't forget you
On some other shore
Fate was my friend
'Cause she brought you again
Now here you are in my arms suddenly
                        
                    |
