「What a wonderful world」

I see trees of green, red roses too
I see them bloom for me and you
And I think to myself,
what a wonderful world

I see skies of blue and clouds of white
The bright blessed day, the dark sacred night
And I think to myself,
what a wonderful world

The colours of the rainbow,
so pretty in the sky
Are also on the faces of people going by
I see friends shakin' hands,
sayin' “How do you do?”
They're really saying “I love you”

I hear babies cryin', I watch them grow
They'll learn much more than I'll ever know
And I think to myself,
what a wonderful world

The colours of the rainbow,
so pretty in the sky
Are also on the faces of people going by
I see friends shakin' hands,
sayin' “How do you do?”
They're really saying “I love you”
I hear babies cryin', I watch them grow
They'll learn much more than I'll ever know
And I think to myself,
what a wonderful world
I think to myself,
what a wonderful world
