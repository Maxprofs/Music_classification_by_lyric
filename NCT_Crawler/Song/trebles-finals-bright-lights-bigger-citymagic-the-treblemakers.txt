                        Bài hát: Trebles Finals: Bright Lights Bigger City/Magic - The Treblemakers

I'm living for the weekend but no, not any more.
Because here that familiar feeling that friday is famous for
I'm looking for some action and its out there somewhere
You can feel the electricity all in the even air
Yeah, it may just be more of the same
But sometimes you wanna go where everyone knows your name
So i guess i have to wait and see
But I'm just gonna let something brand new happen to me
But its alright , its alright, its alright, its alright
Bright lights in the big city
Belongs to us tonight

I've got the magic in me
Every time I touch that track it turns into gold
Now everybody knows I've got the magic in me
When i hit the floor the girls come snapping at me
Now everybody wants some crystal magic
Its tricks that on a tempo will blow your mind
Pick a verse, any verse ill hypnotize you with every line
I need a volunteer
how about you with the eyes
come on down to front and sit right here and don't be shy
So come one, come all and see the show tonight
Prepare to be astounded, (no gold goes to guys?)
You know I'm no Pinocchio i never told the lie
They called me mister magic man
I'm floating on cloud nine

I've got the magic in me
Every time i touch that track it turns into gold
Now everybody knows I've got the magic
Magic magic magic
Magic magic magic
Magic magic magic
Aaaahhhooooooo oo
I've got the magic in me
