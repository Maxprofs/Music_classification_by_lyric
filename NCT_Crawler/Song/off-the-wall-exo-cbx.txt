                        Bài hát: Off The Wall - EXO-CBX

Kinou made no joushiki ja
Huka renai chou sou teigai
You already know, baby you already know
Hibi koushin shi teiku standard yeah

Ima koko we so fly
Turn it up, make it loud turn it up
Sa jiyuu ni egaki daseba ii
Mugen ni hirogasu space (higher ground)

What you feel? Afure deru mama ni
Iro tsukeru kono tede
Uh uh uh everybody
So what you waiting for? What you waiting for?

Fumi koeru boodaa ra in modoranai
Out of the box, what you waiting for ?
Doko made mo kono mama itsu datte
Off the wall (it's alright)

Off the wall (it's alright)
And the brass goes
Ari mo shinai waku ni toraware teru nonsense
You already know, baby you already know yo

Onaji you ni shitero tte? Kotae nara no
Turn it up, make it loud turn it up
Sa jiyuu ni egaki daseba ii
Mugen ni hirogasu space (higher ground)

What you feel? Afure deru mama ni
Iro tsukeru kono tede
Uh uh uh everybody
So what you waiting for? What you waiting for?

Fumi koeru boodaa ra in modoranai
Out of the box, what you waiting for ?
Doko made mo kono mama itsu datte
Off the wall (it's alright)

Off the wall (it's alright)
Dare mo fumi ireta koto nonai tochi e
Bokura no ashi ato tsuke ni ikou yo
Kimi dake ga egakeru sono keshi kiwo

Boku ni mo misete yo
Tachi kiru chain genkai naku gain
Get ready for the slaying
Tsuki nukeru made (that's right, that's right)

Kake nukeru dake
So what you waiting for? What you waiting for?
Fumi koeru boodaa ra in modoranai
Out of the box, what you waiting for?

Doko made mo kono mama itsu datte
Off the wall (it's alright)
Off the wall (it's alright)
So what you waiting for? What you waiting for?

Fumi koeru boodaa ra in modoranai
Out of the box, what you waiting for?
Doko made mo kono mama itsu datte

Off the wall (it's alright)
Off the wall (it's alright)
And the brass goes
                        
                    |
