                        Bài hát : Sing - The Carpenters

Sing, sing a song
Sing out loud
Sing out strong
Sing of good things not bad
Sing of happy not sad

sing, sing a song
Make it simple to last your whole life long
Don’t worry that it’s not good enough
For anyone else to hear
Just sing, sing a song

La la la la la
La la la la la la...

Sing, sing a song
Let the world sing along
Sing of love there could be
Sing for you and for me

sing, sing a song
Make it simple to last your whole life long
Don’t worry that it’s not good enough
For anyone else to hear
Just sing, sing a song

Just sing, sing a song
Just sing, sing a song
