                        Bài hát: You Belong To Me - Bob Dylan

See the pyramids along the Nile
Watch the sunrise from a tropic isle
Just remember, darling all the while
You belong to me

See the marketplace in old Algiers
Send me photographs and souvenirs
Just remember when a dream appears
You belong to me

I'll be so alone without you
Maybe you'll be lonesome too
And blue

Fly the ocean in a silver plane
See the jungle when it's wet with rain
Just remember 'til you're home again
You belong to me

[instrumental verse, as intro]

I'll be so alone without you
Maybe you'll be lonesome too
And blue

Fly the ocean in a silver plane
See the jungle when it's wet with rain
Just remember 'til you're home again
You belong to me

Juliette Lewis: "I just want to tell you I love you, and I miss you. Don't
forget about me. You won't forget about me?"
Woody Harrelson: "I won't forget about you. It's cool. No matter where he takes
you, Timbouktou, it don't matter, because it's fate. Know? Nobody can
stop fate. Nobody can."]
