 Song : Bye Bye Bye
Bye Bye Bye

I'm doing this tonight
You 're probably gonna start a flght
I know this can't be right
Hey Baby come on
I loved you endlessly
When you weren't there for me
So now it's time to leave and make it alone
I know that I can't take no more
It ain't no lie
I wanna see you out that door
Baby bye bye bye
Bye bye
Don't wanna be a fool for you
Just another player in your game for two

You may hate me but it ain't no lie
Babe bye bye bye
Don't really wanna make it tough
I just wanna tell you that I had enough
It might sound crazy but it ain't no lie

You just hit me with the truth
now girl you're more than welcome to
So give me one good reason
Baby come on

I live for you and me
And now I really come to see
That life would be much better
Once you're gone
I'm giving up I know for sure
Don't wanna be
The reason for your love no more
I'm checking out
I'm signing off
Don't wanna be the loser and I've had enough

I Don't wanna be a fool in this game for two
So I'm leaving you behind
(Bye bye bye)
I don't wanna make it tough
(Make it tough)
But I had enough
(Bye bye)
And it ain't no lie
Don't wanna be your fool
But it ain't no lie
Bye bye bye
