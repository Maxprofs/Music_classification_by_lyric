                        Sunrise doesn't last all morning,
a cloudburst doesn't last all day
Seems my love is up
and has left you with no warning
But it's not always going
to be this grey
All things must pass,
all things must pass away
Sunset doesn't last all evening,
a mind can blow those clouds away
after all this my love is up
and must be leaving
It has not always
been this grey
All things must pass,
all things must pass away
All things must pass
none of life's strings can last
So I must be on my way
and face another day
Now the darkness only stays at nighttime,
in the morning it will fade away
Daylight is good
at arriving at the right time
It's not always
going to be this grey
All things must pass,
all things must pass away
All things must pass,
all things must pass away
                        
                    |
