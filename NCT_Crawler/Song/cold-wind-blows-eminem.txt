                        Cause some things just don't change
It's better when they stay the same
Although the whole world knows your name
So on the biggest days they came to see you spit your game
Oh
It shouldn't be difficult to explain
Just why you came back again, you hate the fame
Love the game, cold as ice you remain
* em' all, tell 'em all eat *, here we go again

So, god damn... is it that time again already
Haha, you don't look too happy to see me
* man, don't everybody welcome me back at once
All right, * ya'll then

You can get the dick, just call me the ballsac, I'm nuts
Michael Vick in this bitch, fall back you mutts
* your worms, you never seen such a sick puppy
* it a sick duck, I want my duck sick mummy
And my nuts, lick, gobble 'em up trick, yummy
Bitch you don't *ing think I know that you suck dick dummy?
You'll get your butt kicked, * all that love * honey
Yeah I laugh when I call you a slut, it's funny!
Shawty dance while I *** you to the beat, * the words
You don't listen to 'em anyway, yeah struck a nerve sucker
Mother *er might aswell let my lips pucker
Like Elton John, cause I'm just a mean * sucker
This * is on, cause you went and pissed me off
Now I'm sitting and pissing on everybody
Give a * if it's right or wrong
So buck the buddah, light a bong
But take a look at mariah the next time I inspire you to write a song, cmon

Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh, I'm as cold as the cold wind blows
When it snows and it's twenty be-low
Ask me why man I just don't know know know know know know know
I'm as cold as the cold wind blows blo-blo-blo-blo-blo-blows
Oh oh oh oh oh

* it I'm a loose cannon, Bruce Banner's back in the booth
Ya'll are sitting ducks, I'm the only goose standing
I set the world on fire, piss on it, put it out
Stick my dick in a circle, but I'm not *ing around mother *er
I'll show you pussy footin, I'll kick a bitch in the *
Til it makes her queef and sounds like a *ing whoopy cushion
Who the * is you pushin', you musta mistook me for some sissy
Soft punk looking for some nookie or boosom
Go ahead, *ing hater push me
I told you ain't no *ing way to shush me
Call me a faggot cause I hate a pussy
Man the * up sissy, G's up
All you gardeners freeze up, put your hoes down (shady ease up!)
Man chill, nah I can't god damnit
Rap is a landfill, drop the anvil
These are shoes that you can't fill
* the day that happens the world'll stop spinning
And Michael J. Fox'll come to a stand still
During an earthquake, urine in your face
Cause you're fake, ahh what the *, that hurt wait!
Ahh what the *, I just got struck by lightening
Alright then I quit, god I give up
Call it evil that men do, lord forgive me for what my pen do
This is for your sins, I cleanse you
You can repent but I warn you, if you continue
To hell I'll send you, and just then the wind blew and I said

How long will I be this way? Shady until my dying day
Til I hang up the mic and it's time for me to say
So long, til then I drop the *ing bombs
Like I miss the pass when I went long
If you don't like it you can kiss my * in a lint thong
Now sing along, slut this, slut that, learn the words to the song
Oh bitches don't like that, homie I'll be nicer to women
When the aqua man drowns and the human torch starts swimming
Man I'm a cold soul, I roll solo so
So don't compare me to them other bums over there
It's like apples to oranges, peaches to plums yeah
I'm bananas pussy, cut off the grapes and grow a pair
But I swear, you try to *** me, I'll slaughter you
I put that on everything, like everyone does with auto-tune
That last thing you wanna do is have me spit o
