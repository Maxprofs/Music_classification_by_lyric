                        Bài hát: Up All Night - David Archuleta

[Verse 1]
I am knocking, standin at your door
Somewhere new, I've never been before
Take me in, and it feels like home
Its getting late, and I don't wanna go
Something simple in the way this feels
That love is something pure and real
Its getting late, and i have to leave
But tonight your memory, is holding me

[Chorus]
I'm wide awake with you
All these feelings inside, keepin me up all night
All these feelings inside, im wide awake
All these feelings inside, keepin' me up all night
Pictures that cross my mind, they keepin me up all night
They keepin me up all night
They keepin me up all night
They keepin me up all night

[Verse 2]
Feel my heart, and there's an answered prayer
Feel the magic in the midnight air
Breathe it in, I wanna pass it on
The strength of fighting somewhere you belong

[Chorus]
I'm wide awake with you
All these feelings inside, keeping me up all night
All these feelings inside, I'm wide awake
All these feelings inside, keeping me up all night
Pictures that cross my mind, they keeping me up all night
Keeping me up all night
Keeping me up all night
Keeping me up all night
Keeping me up all night

[Bridge]
Hands so small but i am safe and sound
Where i stand feels like solid ground
No where else hat id rather be
No greater gift than what you've given me

[Chorus]
All these feelings inside, keeping me up all night
All these feelings inside, I'm wide awake
All these feelings inside, keeping me up all night
Pictures that cross my mind, they keeping me up all night
Keeping me up all night
Keeping me up all night
Keeping me up all night
Keeping me up all night

[Outro]
Keeping me up, keeping me up at night
                        
                    |
