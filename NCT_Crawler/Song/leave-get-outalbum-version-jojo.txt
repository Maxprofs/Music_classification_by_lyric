                        I've been waiting all day for ya babe
 So wontcha come sit and talk to me
 Tell me how we are gonna be together always
 Hope you know that when it's late at night
 I hold on to my pillow tight
 And think of how you promised me forever
 (I never thought that anyone)
 Could make me feel this way
 (Now that you're here boy all I want)
 Is just a chance to say

 [Chorus:]
 Get Out (Leave) Right Now
 It's the end of you and me
 It's too late (now) and I can't wait
 For you to be gone
 'Cuz I know about her (who) and I wonder (why) how I bought all the lies
 You said that you would treat me right
 But you was just a waste of time (waste of time)

 Tell me why you're looking so confused
 When I'm the one who didn't know the truth
 How could you ever be so cold?
 To go behind my back and call my friend
 Boy you must have gone and bumped your head
 Because you left her number on your phone
 (So now after all is said and done)
 Maybe I'm the one to blame
 (to think that you could be the one)
 Well it didn't work out that way

 [Chorus:]

 I wanted you right here with me
 But I have no choice you've got to leave
 Because my heart is breakin'
 With every word I'm sayin'
 I gave up everything I had
 On something that just wouldn't last
 But I refuse to cry
 No tears will fall from these
 Eyeeee-eyeees (oooohhh-ooohh)
 Get out!

 [Chorus x2]

 Get out, (leave), you and me, it's too late, (now) it's too late! Ooh, about her, (who? Why?)
 You said that you would treat me right, but you was just a waste of time (waste of time).
                        
                    |
