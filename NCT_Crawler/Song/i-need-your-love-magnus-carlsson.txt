I need it

Every morning i wake up
I try to find my way
Carry on to be strong
Try to make it on my own - yeah
I never thought we could break up
Never had a single doubt
Now I'm all alone
The feeling's hanging on
Since you went away
I think about you every day
You know my love is here to stay
I can't believe it's true
I need your love tonight
I only want to hold you tight
I I I need your love tonight
To keep my fantasy
Baby I need your love tonight
I only want to make it right
I I I need your love tonight
Love come back to me
Baby I need your love
Every moment I wonder
If I let you slip away
Keeping track going back
To the good times that we had - oh
Since you went away ...
I need your love tonight ...

I need it

Since you went away ...
I need your love
I need your love
I need your love tonight ...
