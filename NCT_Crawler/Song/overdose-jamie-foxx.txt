                        They say, I had it bad, addicted to what we had
 Heartbreaks now fading fast, vital's low, might not last
 Strapped down while sirens ring, holding on trying to breathe
 Not like this, I can't leave, look what you've done to me I overdosed, overdosed, overdosed, on you
 They said, I've overdosed, overdosed, overdosed on you
 'Cause I want you close, need you the most
 Without you I'm just through
 So I've overdosed, overdosed, overdosed on you Rushing me, switching lanes, I.V.'s on through my veins
 Blood tests say no cocaine, they don't know you're the blame
 'Cause you're deep inside of me, so this is goodbye to me
 But for you I'll die happily, one more hit, I'll be free I overdosed, overdosed, overdosed, on you
 They said, I've overdosed, overdosed, overdosed on you
 'Cause I want you close, need you the most
 Without you I'm just through
 So I've overdosed, overdosed, I overdosed on you 'Cause I know that you would kill me
 'Cause I'm sweatin', tweakin', faintin'
 Never been so hurt
 But damn, I love this feeling
 'Cause I'm achin', breakin', shakin'
 Will I make it through the night And now my body's cold
 I'm losing it, 'cause I was abusing it, oh no
 Can't nobody help, I did it to myself
 And that's why I'll do it again and again I overdosed, overdosed, overdosed on you
 They said, I overdosed, overdosed, overdosed on you
 'Cause I want you close, need you the most
 Without you I'm just through
 'Cause I overdosed, overdosed, overdosed on you
