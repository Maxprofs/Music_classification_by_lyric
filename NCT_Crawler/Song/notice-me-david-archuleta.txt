                        [Verse 1:] 
I try to find the words when you walk by 
But words just can't explain the way I feel, inside 
My friends keep saying you're untouchable 
And I can't help feeling invisible 

[Chorus:] 
I'd give anything to catch your eye 
So you could see me in a different light 
Tell me what's it gonna take, cuz I 
Wish you would notice me 
If you'd only give me just one chance 
I could be the one, here I am 
What's it gonna take to understand 
Wish you would notice me 
Notice, notice, notice me [2x] 

[Verse 2:] 
You've got a light that never seems to fade 
I'm drawn to you and I can't look away 
We come from different places, girl I know 
But two worlds colliding could be beautiful 

[Repeat Chorus] 

I wonder if you know how amazing you are 
You leave me breathless 
You didn't even try but you stole my heart 
And I don't want it back 

[Repeat Chorus]
                        
                    |
