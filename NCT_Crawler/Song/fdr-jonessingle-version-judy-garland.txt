                        I hear tell there's a stranger in the Jones
 Household
 (yes siree, yes siree)
 That's what I'm told
 I hear tell there's a new arrival six days old
 (yes siree, yes siree)
 Worth his weight in gold
 Come right in
 And meet the son
 Christening's done
 Time to have some fun
 (yes siree, yes siree, yes siree)

 Yes siree, yes siree
 It's a big holiday everywhere
 For the Jones family has a brand new heir
 He's the joy heaven sent
 And they proudly present
 Mister Franklin D. Roosevelt Jones

 When he grows up he never will stray
 With a name like the one that he's got today
 As he walks down the street folks will say
 "Pleased to meet,
 Mister Franklin D. Roosevelt Jones"

 What a smile and how he shows it
 He'll keep happy all day long
 What a name, I bet he knows it
 With that handle how can he go wrong?

 And the folks in the town all agree
 He'll be famous, as famous as he can be
 How can he be a dud or a stick in the mud
 When he's Franklin D. Roosevelt Jones?
 (yes siree, yes siree, yes siree)
 Cause he's Franklin D. Roosevelt Jones.
