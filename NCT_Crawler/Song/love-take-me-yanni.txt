                        Come here, my heart cry
Breath in you moonlight
Take me away
Come feel my yearning
For ever burn
Love makes me alive
Dive into fire
Feel my desire
You are know and safe
(You’ll find my heart will love you)
Let passion Ignite
Lust for the night
Love Make me alive
I hear your cry
And I run to you
Come fill my soul
With love I never knew
Our love makes me fly high
Love makes me rise alive
Take me...
Come here, my heart cry
Breath in moonlight
Take me away
(You’ll find my heart will love you)
Come feel my yearning
For ever burn
Love makes me... alive!
Love will take me.
