                        How many times
 Are you going to apologize about the same thing
 And how many times can I take it back
 When I'm not the one who's doing wrong (When I'm not the ones doing wrong no)
 I thought that maybe if I started praying
 That we would get better but
 When I would pray, the answer would always come
 Back to me being done
 But we are so hard headed
 When we're in love

 So I...

 *Chorus*

 I told myself
 That I would make some changes
 But the more I change
 There's one thing that remains the same
 I can't seem to shake you (shake you)
 You seem to really have a hold on me
 And everytime that we break up
 We turn around and make up
 This can't go on and now
 I got to move on and now
 Its not the fact that I don't love you no more
 But I've got to break this bad habit
 Can't take this bad habit no more

 I'm totally out of my element
 Learning new ways to live
 While you're in a comfort zone
 Not even thinking (you couldn't think about me)
 To call me, when I get mad you're buying me gifts
 Thinking it's going to solve every issue
 From the girl calling my phone
 To the pictures that I saw (you know what I saw)
 And every time you would break up with me for
 Nothing at all
 I've taken all I can take (I've taken all I can take)
 But the way I live has got to change
 Ohhhh

 *Chorus*

 Let me break it down
 Have you ever loved somebody?
 So much that you was just too blind to see, past
 All of the pain, that they was causing you
 Ladies, do you feel me? (do you feel me?)
 Have you ever loved somebody?
 So much that you went against the right thing
 That you should do (do)
 Ohh, ohhh
 Then it's time to make a change (time to make a change)
 So I

 *Chorus*
                        
                    |
