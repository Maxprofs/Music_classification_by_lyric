                        Bài hát: Something In Common - Whitney Houston, Bobby Brown

I know I may have made mistakes before
But now I understand what those mistakes were for
Throughout my travel's girl, I realized
What you see, what you get don't always coincide

A bird in the hand beats two in the bush
But just one look was all it took
Could it be that we're the only one's thinkin' of
Harmony, ecstasy, there's somethin' about this love
(We, we have something in common)

Girl you mean so much to me
It should be plain to see that we
(We, we have something in common)
It's the way we feel about each other
When we're together

I'm the type of girl who understands my man
I'll be strong, when he's weak, I will hold his hand
Now I believe old fashioned rules and old fashioned ways
Courtesy, honesty, like in the old days

You're my man and I'm your girl
There's nothing better in this whole wide world
I'll stand by your side till the very end
All in all, best of love, we are friends
(We, we have something in common)

Boy, you mean so much to me
It should be plain to see that we
(We, we have something in common)
It's the way we feel about each other
When we're together
(We, we have something in common)

Yes we do, yes we do, yes we do
Yes we do, oh, baby
(We, we have something in common)
It's the way we feel about each other
When we're together

Girl you know it's you that I adore
And there's no one in this world
That I love more, more

Just a little bit aaha, just a little bit aaha
Just a little bit aaha, just a little bit aaha
Just a little bit aaha, just a little bit aaha
Baby, baby, baby, baby

Don't you know that we
( We have something in common)
We, have something in common
You and me, me and you
I'm sweatin' for your body
(We have something in common)
And you mean so much to me boy
When we're together

So we
(We, we have something in common)
We never have no problems, baby
(We have something in common)
You and me, me and you, you and me

Brings together, baby
(We have something in common)
(We have something in common)
(We have something in common)
I love you more and more and more and more, baby
I love you baby

We have something in common
We, we have something in common
We have something in common together
We, we have something in common
We have something in common together
Something in common

We have something in common
We have something in common
We have something in common
                        
                    |
