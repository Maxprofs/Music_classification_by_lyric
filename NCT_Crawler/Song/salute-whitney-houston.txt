Salute
Whitney Houston

Say you wanna run away
You ain't got nothing to say
But I salute you
Go on out the door,
Now, you take care
No more tears to shed
What, you expecting me to beg,
Girl i'm not undone
So when you leave just close the door behind you,

Cause, i'm feeling kind of hotter than you, mainly
I'm feeling kind of stronger than you, lately
I'm feeling kind of better than you,
And I know just what to do,
I feel like doing my head
I feel like all there's some of my friends
I feel like going to a club and partying

Cause i'm a soldier girl, in this world
Stand alone, candle strong
I walked a mile, and made home
It's good to know without you I made it
Soldier girl, in my world
Took the fall now I stand tall
All the pain and all, I made it through
And now ima vowel to say to you
Salute, ay, ay
Salute, ay, ay

You think you know everything,
See you think that your sh don't stink,
Well it do, yeah
And when it comes to me,
You don't have a clue
It took me all of these years,
To realise that you gonna be long here
I can do better,
You say ill never do better
Yeah, like whatever

I'm feeling kind of hotter than you, mainly
I'm feeling kind of stronger than you, lately
I'm feeling kind of better than you,
And I know just what to do
I feel like doing my head
I feel like all there's some of my friends
I feel like going to a club and partying

I'm a soldier girl, in this world
Stand alone, candle strong
I walked a mile, and made home
It's good to know without you I made it
Soldier, girl, in my world
Took the fall now I stand tall
All the pain and all, I made it through
And now ima vowel to say to you
Salute, ay, ay

So don't call me to come back
I did it for years,
Through all of the drama and the pain
And all of the tears
It's time to stop this rollercoaster,
So that I can get on
Let me start moving mountains, swimming seas,
And climbing over walls

I'm a soldier girl, in this world
Stand alone, candle strong
I walked a mile, and made home
It's good to know without you I made it
Soldier, girl, in my world
Took the fall now I stand tall
All the pain and all, I made it through
And now ima vowel to say to you
Salute, ay, ay
Salute, ay, ay
