She said, shut up and dance with me!

[R. Kelly - Ignition (Remix)]
Toot, Toot

Runnin' her hands through my 'fro

Hot and fresh out the kitchen
Mama rollin'

If I were a boy
Even just for a day
I’d roll outta bed in the morning
And throw on what I wanted and go

[The Cranberries - Zombie]
Another head hangs lowly
Child is slowly taken
And the violence, caused such silence
Who are we mistaken?
With their tanks, and their bombs
And their bombs, and their guns
In your head, in your head they are crying
In your head, in your head
Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie
What's in your head, in your head
Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie, oh

[Kelly Clarkson - Stronger (What Doesn't Kill You)]
What doesn't kill you makes you stronger
Stand a little taller
Doesn't mean I'm lonely when I'm alone
What doesn't kill you makes a fighter
Footsteps even lighter
Doesn't mean I'm over cause you're gone

[Bruno Mars - Grenade]
I'd catch a grenade for ya
Throw my hand on a blade for ya
I'd jump in front of a train for ya
You know I'd do anything for ya

[Christina Perri - Human]
But I'm only human
And I bleed when I fall down
I'm only human
And I crash and I break down
Your words in my head, knives in my heart
You build me up and then I fall apart
'Cause I'm only.

[Avicii - Wake Me Up (ft. Aloe Blacc)]
So wake me up when it's all over
When I'm wiser and I'm older
All this time I was finding myself
And I didn't know I was lost

What doesn't kill you makes you stronger
So wake me up when it's all over
Zombie-ie-ie
When I'm wiser and I'm older
All this time I was finding myself
You know I'd catch a grenade for ya
Didn't know I was lost
Yeah, yeah, yeah
