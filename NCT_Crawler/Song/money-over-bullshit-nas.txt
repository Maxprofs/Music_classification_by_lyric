R&B/Hip Hop/Rap|

                        My niggaz got scarred grills, skully hats and gats be fullys
 Brat, cars peel, the East Coast cartel
 Rats get their tails snapped and trapped
 The snitches in the streets and the snitches who rap Pure euphoria, a dose of death to all of ya
 Coroner choruses sung from The Bridge to Astoria
 Dreams of fallin' in the elevator, passin' floors
 Suddenly stop, the doors open up to a brick wall I can smell the haters, wishful thinkers, bad luck prayers
 Picture your tarot cards and bodyguards gettin' sprayed up
 Sabotagin' my makeup, my watches get laced up
 Even if they indicted Jacob Forensics, Paramedics carry cowards off
 Defibrillators shock to your chest, try to cough
 They die and hit Hell from an iron
 I'm flyin', wire or cell, I'm paid from this *** Got bitches high as hell, and they ***in' like AIDS don't exist
 They get sent to your hotel, a maid and a ***
 Put a barrel in a capo mouth, 'til his scalp come out
 You a kid, you don't live what you rap about King poetic, too many haters to count
 Too much paper to count, QB bitch Join me in war, many will live, many will mourn
 Money over bull***, pistols over brawn
 Afraid not of none of you cowards but of my own strength
 Afraid not of none of you cowards but of my own strength Join me in war, many will live, many will mourn
 (My own strength nigga, that's what I'm scared of)
 Money over bull***, pistols over brawn
 Afraid not of none of you cowards but of my own strength
 Afraid not of none of you cowards but of my own strength Got seven candles lit, black wallpaper, black carpet
 Thinkin' 'bout which nigga to target
 You kill a nigga today, he lives forever
 So I plotted out smarter, there'll be no Martyrs Black Tec on the table, Mag .44
 Black negligee on my bitch, she's at the door
 Black fish eggs, nigga, that's the caviar
 You niggaz fish-made, y'all niggaz is fifth grade Niggaz, it's fifty ways to dissect the General
 If I give ya the top five, you will not survive
 Rule 1, cocksucker, keep my name from your tongue
 Rule 2, thought ya knew don't *** with God's Son Rule 3, see, matter fact, I just wait
 If y'all reach top five, then I'ma eat y'all alive
 Each one of you guys that claim Hip-Hop is still alive
 Like y'all ain't in agreement wit Nas Join me in war, many will live, many will mourn
 Money over bull***, pistols over brawn
 Afraid not of none of you cowards but of my own strength
 Afraid not of none of you cowards but of my own strength Join me in war, many will live, many will mourn
 (My own strength nigga, that's what I'm scared of)
 Money over bull***, pistols over brawn
 Afraid not of none of you cowards but of my own strength
 Afraid not of none of you cowards but of my own strength From crack pushers to Lac' pushers and ambushers
 And morticians to fortresses, case-dismisses laced in riches
 Cake ridiculous from nickel and dimin' to trickin' them diamonds
 Vegas, places in Switzerland From non-blastin' to auto, I don't have to blast mine
 They blast mine, black nine, you flatline, my cash climb, buy rare art
 Antique pieces, Mona Lisa's, own no leases
 Five-star restaurant eaters Don't forget who your peeps is
 'Sposed to dine with you, sip that good wine with you
 Only if they grind with you or slang for ya
 Seen niggaz live, laugh, party and die in that very same corner Pretty girls glance at us, status unconceivable
 Private planes landed out in Teterboro, weed I twirl
 Once even gave me a phobia that I be in a spot trapped
 Like Madame Zenobia's with this kid eyein' my Rolly, y'all Join me in war, many will live, many will mourn
 Money over bull***, pistols over brawn
 Afraid not of none of you cowards but of my own strength
 Afraid not of none of you cowards but of my own strength Join me in war, many will live, many will mourn
 (My own strength nigga, that's what I'm scared of)
 Money over bull***, pistols over brawn
 Afraid not of none of you cowards but of my own strength
 Afraid not of none of you cowards but of my own strength There it is, QB bitch, yeah
 QB bitch, yeah, yeah
 QB bitch
