                        [Verse 1]
 Those fingers in my hair
 That sly come-hither stare
 That strips my conscience bare
 It's witchcraft

 And I've got no defense for it
 The heat is too intense for it
 What good would common sense for it do?

 [Chorus]
 'cause it's witchcraft, wicked witchcraft
 And although I know it's strictly taboo
 When you arouse the need in me
 My heart says "Yes, indeed" in me
 "Proceed with what you're leadin' me to"

 It's such an ancient pitch
 But one I wouldn't switch
 'cause there's no nicer witch than you

 [Chorus]
 'cause it's witchcraft, that crazy witchcraft
 And although I know it's strictly taboo
 When you arouse the need in me
 My heart says "Yes, indeed" in me
 "Proceed with what you're leadin' me to"

 It's such an ancient pitch
 But one I'd never switch
 'cause there's no nicer witch than you
                        
                    |
