Keeps gettin' better - Christina Aguilera

Step back gonna come at ya fast
I'm driving out of control
And getting ready to crash
Won't stop shaking up what I can
I serve it up with a shot
So suck it down like a man
So baby yes I know what I am
And no I don't give a damn
You'll be loving it
Some days I'm a super bitch
Up to my own tricks
But it won't last forever
Next day I'm your super girl
Out to save the world
And it keeps getting better
Kiss kiss gonna tell you right now
I'll make it sweet on the lips as it'll knock you out
Shut up I don't care what you say
Cuz when we both on the way you're gonna like it my way
Yeah baby there's a feeling in me so sexy sour and sweet
And you'll be loving it
Some days I'm a super bitch
Up to my own tricks
But it won't last forever
Next day I'm your super girl
Out to save the world
And it keeps getting better
Hold on
Keeps getting better
Hold on
Keeps getting better
In the blink of an eye
In the speed of the light
All the universal will make the planets collide
I must travel my ? With the sips?
See the vixen in me
Becomes the angel for you
Some days I'm a super bitch
Up to my own tricks
But it won't last forever
Next day I'm your super girl
Out to save the world
And it keeps getting better
Some days I'm a super bitch
Up to my own tricks
But it won't last forever
Next day I'm your super girl
Out to save the world
And it keeps getting better
Hold on
It keeps getting better
Hold on
It keeps getting better
