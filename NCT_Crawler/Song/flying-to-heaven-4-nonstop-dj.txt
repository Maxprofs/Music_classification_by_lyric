Right in the night 
Right in the night 
Right in the night you'll find 
That if you want to fall in love you'll fall in love 

Right in the night 
Right in the night sweet thing is what you'll get 
When you fall in love, you fall in love 

Fall in love with music, fall in love with dance 
Fall in love with anything that makes you want romance 
Make a little softer on the way that you go 
Just think that everything you touch could turn to gold 

Fall in love with everything that you would love to love 
You know that laughter is a kind form to wake you up 
So don't make me feel unpleasant like you do 
You know that everything will fall right back on you 

So fall in love with everything, fall in love with life 
Forget about your troubles and be a little nice 
You will not see me if you don't want to look 
Just come and get me in my big big bed of love 
Big big bed of love 

Right in the night 
Right in the night 
Right in the night you'll find 
That if you want to fall in love you'll fall in love 

Right in the night 
Right in the night sweet thing is what you'll get 
When you fall in love, you fall in love 

So fall in love with stories if fairy tales are true 
Innocence is part of what you're losin' with your youth 
Show a little confidence, show a little class 
Don't kiss the past, the past ain't gonna last 

Just fall in love with passion, fall in love with lust 
Fall in love with all the things you're always dreaming of 
Fall in love with music and you will get by 

Right in the night 
Right in the night 
Right in the night you'll find 
That if you want to fall in love you'll fall in love 

Right in the night 
Right in the night sweet thing is what you'll get 
When you fall in love, you'll fall in love

2 I gotta realize what I adore 
Now I know what I was searching for 
Neither was I meant to be insane 
Nor was meant to live in pain 

I’m the one that sets me free 
Cuz no one could ever take this away from me 
Oh... 

Yesterday has gone, it disappeared 
I can see purely now, not weir 
Infinity is on the line, I’m cleared 
Insanity is gone, but I’m still here 
Oh... 

Vision you 
Vision me 
We are all about to be 

Vision life 
Vision glee 
Though this turning just appears (?) 

Breaking mind 
Take the chance 
Exhale the spirit of the glance 

Vision peace 
And vision love 
Cuz you are the only one above 

*Need help with this one!* 
*Thanks K* 
*Thanks Wispa!*

3 Counting out the hours
Like the beat of a song
I feel like a stranger
Wondering where I belong

I wanna start all over
But I know that I can’t
I’m helpless without you
I don’t know who I am

I’m under your spell
Bound and blind and only you can save me
I’m tangled up inside
Caught in your web
I’m hypnotized and only you can wake me
Only you can bring this heart to life

Colors feel so faded
And I can’t hear a sound
I’m walking in circles
Watching my world burn down

There’s nothing else to fight for
Cuz you’re all that I know
I’m stuck in your shadow
Letting you take control

I’m under your spell
Bound and blind and only you can save me
I’m tangled up inside
Caught in your web
I’m hypnotized and only you can wake me
Only you can bring this heart to life

So pull me in and don’t let go
I wanna fall forever
I wanna overflow
If there’s some way out, don’t let me know
I don’t wanna come to
It’s too big to undo
I need to be near you
I can’t keep away...
Under your spell
I’m under your spell

I’m under your spell
Bound and blind and only you can save me
I’m tangled up inside
Caught in your web
I’m hypnotized and only you can wake me
Only you can bring this heart to life
                        
                    |
