                        Once again I'm longing 
For your hungry touch 
Picturing you on me 
I am missing you so much 
You turn on my imagination 
Though you're far away 
And in my fantasy you crave my body 
I need you back to stay 

I've got my inside out and my headache won't stop 
I fail to not look back as I'm bouncing down the wrong track 
Half way up feels like going down 
But I am getting stronger and stronger 
Uh oh uh oh uh oh 
Uh oh uh oh uh oh 
But I am getting stronger and stronger... 

Midnight turns to morning 
And I don't get no sleep 
I know that you are out there somewhere being 
Someone else's treat 
Your fingers know just how to please me 
And chills run down my spine 
And when you lick and spill your kisses 
I am shivering inside 

I've got my inside out and my headache won't stop 
I fail to not look back as I'm bouncing down the wrong track 
Half way up feels like going down 
But I am getting stronger and stronger 
Uh oh uh oh uh oh 
Uh oh uh oh uh oh 
But I am getting stronger and stronger... 

I've got my inside out and my headache won't stop 
I fail to not look back as I'm bouncing down the wrong track 
Half way up feels like going down 
But I am getting stronger and stronger
                        
                    |
