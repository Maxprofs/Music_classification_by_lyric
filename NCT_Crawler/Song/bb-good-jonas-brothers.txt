Jonas Brothers - Bb Good

I'll pick you up at 7
We can drive around
And see a movie
Every scene will have a meaning
But you'll be the one that moves me

I've been hurt before
So, baby, promise
That you're gonna be true
I'm gonna be be good
So tell me that you're
Gonna be good too, yeah

You gotta be be good to me
I'm gonna be be good to you
We'll be happy as can be
Just gotta be be good to me, baby

I'm gonna treat you right
We'll never fight
Now, baby, you can trust me
When I hold you tight
I feel all right
I guess that I'm just lucky

I've been hurt before
So, baby, promise
That you're gonna be true, oh
I'm gonna be be good
So tell me that you're
Gonna be good too

You gotta be be good to me
I'm gonna be be good to you
We'll be happy as can be
You gotta be be good to me, baby

Listen, girl
You gotta be good
I don't wanna hurt you
I wanna kiss you
Yeah!
Come on, come on
Come over here

You gotta be be good to me
I'm gonna be be good to you
We'll be happy as can be
You gotta be be good to me
Come on, come on

You gotta be be good to me
I'm gonna be be good to you
We'll be happy as can be
Just gotta be be good to me

Listen, girl
You're outta control
I think you and me
Would be a great couple
Yeah
