                        (Christina)
Another shot of whiskey please bartender
Keep it coming till I don't remember at all
How bad it hurts when you're gone (na na na)

Turn the music up a little bit louder
Just gotta get past the midnight hour (uh huh)
Maybe tomorrow it won't
Be
This
Hard
Who am I kidding
I know what I'm missing

You
I had my heart set on you
But nothing else hurts like you do
Who knew that love was so cruel (Yeah yeah yeah)
And I
Waited and waited so long
For someone who'll never come home
It's my fault to think you'll be true (Yeah yeah)
I'm just a fool (Yeah)

(Blake Shelton)
I said that I don't care
I'd walk away whatever
And I tell myself we were bad together (Uh huh)
But that's just me trying to move on
With
Out
You

(Together)
But who am I kidding
I know what I'm missing
Hey
I had my heart set on you
But nothing else hurts like you do
Who knew that love was so cruel(Yeah yeah yeah)
And I
Waited and waited so long
For someone who'll never come home
It's my fault to think you'll be true (Yeah yeah)
I'm just a fool

(Blake Shelton)
For holding on to something that
Is never ever gonna come back
I can't accept that it's lost

(Christina)
I should have let it go
Held my tongue
Kept my big mouth shut
'Cause now everything is just wrong, wrong, wrong...

(Together)
I'm just a fool
A fool for you
I'm just a fool

I had my heart set on you
And nothing else hurts like you do
Who knew that love was so cruel (Yeah yeah yeah)
And I
Waited and waited so long
For someone who'll never come home
It's my fault to think you'll be true (Yeah yeah)
I'm just a fool
I'm just a fool
I'm just a fool

It's my fault to think you'll be true (Yeah yeah yeah)
I'm just a fool
