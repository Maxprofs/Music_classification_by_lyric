                        Bài hát: Joanne (Where Do You Think You're Goin'?) (Piano Version) - Lady Gaga

Take my hand, stay Joanne
Heaven's not ready for you
Every part of my aching heart
Needs you more than the angels do

[Chorus]
Girl, where do you think you're goin'?
Where do you think you're goin', goin', girl?
Girl, where do you think you're goin'?
Where do you think you're goin', goin', girl?

[Verse 2]
If you could, I know that you'd stay
We both know things don't work that way
I promised I wouldn't say goodbye
So I grin and my voice gets thin

[Chorus]
Girl, where do you think you're goin'?
Where do you think you're goin', goin', girl?
Girl, where do you think you're goin'?
Where do you think you're goin', goin', girl?

[Bridge]
Honestly, I know where you're goin'
And baby, you're just movin' on
And I'll still love you even if I can't see you anymore
Can't wait to see you soar


[Chorus]
Girl, where do you think you're goin'?
Where do you think you're goin', goin', girl?
Girl, where do you think you're goin'?
Where do you think you're goin', goin', girl?

[Outro]
Call me Joanne
XO, Joanne
XOXO, Joanne
