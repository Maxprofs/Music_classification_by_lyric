I'm feeling giddy
So full of Cheer
This always happens
This magic time of year
We're lighting candles
We're trimming trees
We're spinning Dreidels
Spin one for me
I'm training Reindeer
I'm drinking Nog (Nog)
I'll make a snowman (Frosty)
In my backyard
I'm standing under the mistletoe
My lips are puckered
Hey... Where'd you go?

Santa Santa
We'll behave
Quit those silly evil ways
I can't wait to celebrate
Let's celebrate

We're jolly to the core
Jolly to the core
Sleigh bells in the sky
Carolers on my door
I'm feeling so much joy
It's time for love not war
I'm jolly to the
Too jolly to the... core

It's time for giving
So what you got (What you got)
Oh I'm just kidding
Or maybe not
I've got my eye on
That wicked dress
I've got a wishlist too
I must confess
Let's not forget
To tell the Elves
We think of others 
Not just ourselves (Oh no)
And the greatest gift (What's that?)
To every boy and girl (Hey hey)
Peace on earth
Around the world!

Santa Santa
We'll behave
Quit those silly evil ways
I can't wait to celebrate
Let's celebrate

We're jolly to the core
Jolly to the core
Sleigh bells in the sky
Carolers on my door
I'm feeling so much joy
It's time for love not war
I'm jolly to the
Too jolly to the... core

Let's celebrate
We'll behave
Feeling so much joy
Cause we will always be
Jolly to the core
Jolly to the core
Sleigh bells in the sky
Carolers at my door
I'm feeling so much joy
It's time for love not war
I'm jolly to the
Too Jolly to the...

We're jolly to the core
Jolly to the core
Sleigh bells in the sky
Carolers on my door
I'm feeling so much joy
It's time for love not war
I'm jolly to the
Too Jolly to the...
To the core

Jolly to the core
