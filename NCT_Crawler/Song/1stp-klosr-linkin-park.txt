.. Break!

I’m about to break
This room to breathe 
This room to breathe
This room to breathe

I cannot take this anymore
Saying everything I said before
All these words they make no sense
I've found bliss in ignorance
Less I hear, the less you say
You'll find that out anyway


I find the answers aren't so clear
Wish I could find a way to disappear
All these thoughts they make no sense
I've found bliss in ignorance
Nothing seems to go away
Over and over again
Over and over again
Over and over again
Over and over again
Over and over again..

Just like before..

Everything you say to me
(And I'm about to break)
I need a little room to breathe
(I'm about to break)
Everything you say to me
(And I'm about to break)
I need a little room to breathe
(And I'm about to.. Break)

These are places where i can feel
Torn from my body, my flesh it peels
During this ride we can cut up what we like
Waiting alone i cannot resist
Feeling this hate i have never missed
Please someone give me a reason to peel off my face
Blood is pouring, pouring, pouring
and pouring
and pouring
and pouring
and pouring
and pouring
and pouring
and pouring..

Shut up when I’m talking to you
Shut up
(Blood is pouring)
Shut up
(Blood is pouring)
Shut up
(Blood is pouring)
Shut up when I’m talking to you
Shut up
(Blood is pouring)
Shut up
(Blood is pouring)
Shut up
(Blood is pouring)
Shut up
I’m about to break

Everything you say to me
(I'm about to break)
I need a little room to breathe
(I'm about to break)
Everything you say to me
(And I'm about to break)
I need a little room to breathe
(I'm about to..)


Everything you say to me
(Takes me one step closer to the edge
And I'm about to break)
I need a little room to breathe
(Cause i'm one step closer to the edge
I'm about to break)
Everything you say to me
(Take me one step closer to the edge
And I'm about to break)
I need a little room to breathe
(Cause i'm one step closer to the edge
I'm about to..)
