                        On a wagon bound for market
There's a calf with a mournful eye.
High above him, there's a swallow
Winging swiftly through the sky.

[Chorus:]
How the winds are laughing.
They laugh with all their might.
Laugh and laugh the whole day through.
And half the summer's night.
Dona, dona, dona
Dona, dona, dona, di
Dona, dona, dona
Dona, dona, dona, di


"Stop complaing," said the farmer.
"Who told you what a calf to be.
"Why don't you have wings to fly with
"Like the swallow so proud and free."

[Chorus]

Calves are easily bound and slaughtered
Never knowing the reason why.
But whoever treasures freedom
Like the swallow has learned to fly.

[Chorus]
Dona, dona, dona, di
                        
                    |
