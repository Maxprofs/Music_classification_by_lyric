                        (Woo hoo, woo hoo)
 (Woo hoo, woo hoo) Well my heart knows me better than I know myself
 So I'm gonna let it do all the talking
 (Woo hoo, woo hoo) I came across a place in the middle of nowhere
 With a big black horse and a cherry tree
 (Woo hoo, woo hoo) I felt a little fear upon my back
 I said don't look back, just keep on walking
 (Woo hoo, woo hoo) Well the big black horse said, "Look this way"
 He said, "Hey lil' lady, will you marry me?"
 (Woo hoo, woo hoo) But I said, No no, no, no no no
 I said, No no, you're not the one for me
 No no, no, no no no
 I said, No no, you're not the one for me
 (Ooo, woo hoo) And my heart had a problem in the early hours
 So I stopped it dead for a beat or two
 (Woo hoo, woo hoo) But I cut some cord and I shouldn't have done it
 And it won't forgive me after all these years
 (Woo hoo, woo hoo) So I sent her to a place in the middle of nowhere
 With a big black horse and a cherry tree
 (Woo hoo, woo hoo) Now it won't come back 'cause it's oh so happy
 And now I've got a hole for the world to see, yeah
 (Woo hoo, woo hoo) And it said, No no, no, no no no
 Said, No no, you're not the one for me
 No no, no, no no no
 Said, No no, you're not the one for me
 (Ooo, woo hoo)
 Not the one for me, yeah
 (Ooo, woo hoo) Said, No, no, no, no
 No, no, no, no no
 You're not the one for me
 (Woo hoo)
 No, no, no, no
 (Woo hoo, woo hoo)
 No, no, no, no no
 You're not the one for me Big black horse and a cherry tree
 (No no, no, no no no)
 I can't quite get there cause my heart's forsaken me, yeah, yeah, yeah
 (No no)
 Big black horse and a cherry tree
 (No no, no, no no no)
 I can't quite get there cause my heart's forsaken me
 (No no)
