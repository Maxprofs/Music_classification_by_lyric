                        Bài hát: Dress - Taylor Swift

Out secret moments
In your crowded room
They've got no idea
About me and you
There is an invitation
In the shape of you
Made your mark on me
A golden tattoo
All of this silence and patience, panic, and anticipation
My hands are shaking from holding back from you (ah, ah, ah)
All of this silence and patience, panic, and desperately waiting
My hands are shaking from all this (ha, ha, ha, ha)

Say my name and everything just stops
I don't want you like a best friend
Only bought this dress on you could take it off, take it off (ha, ha, ha)
Carve your name into my bedpost
Cause I don't like you like a best friend
Only bought this dress on you could take it off, take it off (ha, ha, ha)

You're just incapable
I'm not even going to try
And if I get burned, at least we were electrified
I'm spilling wine in the bathtub
You kiss my face when we're both drunk
Anyone thinks that they know us
But they know nothing about
All of this silence and patience, panic, and anticipation
My hands are shaking from holding back from you (ah, ah, ah)
All of this silence and patience, panic, and desperately waiting
My hands are shaking from all this (ha, ha, ha, ha)

Say my name and everything just stops
I don't want you like a best friend
Only bought this dress on you could take it off, take it off (ha, ha, ha)
Carve your name into my bedpost
Cause I don't want you like a best friend
Only bought this dress on you could take it off, take it off (ha, ha, ha)...
Only bought this dress on you could take it off, take it off...
Only bought this dress on you could take it off, take it off...

Nights back when you met me
Your buzzcut, and my hair bleed
Even in my worst times
You could see the best of me
Flash back to my mid-six
My rebounds, my earthquakes
Even in my worst nights
You saw the truth of me
Now I woke up just in time
Now I wake up by your side
My one and only, my lifeline
Now I woke up just in time
Now I wake up by your side
My hands are shaking, and I can't explain this (ha, ha, ha, ha)

Say my name and everything just stops
I don't want you like a best friend
Only bought this dress on you could take it off, take it off (ha, ha, ha)
Carve your name into my bedpost
Cause I don't want you like a best friend
Only bought this dress on you could take it off, take it off (ha, ha, ha)

There is an invitation
In the shape of you
Only bought this dress on you could take it off
Make your mark on me, golden tattoo
Only bought this dress on you could take it off
