                        Bài hát: Mascara - G.E.M (Đặng Tử Kỳ)

So what if I’ve been lied to
I’ve gotten used to being sad
Empty eyes, red with tears
But remember don’t be too stubborn
The lonely, silent me
What else can I say
My weakness and weariness
Cover it up with mascara

The rose is bleeding
Polluting the white snow
Who wants to know
How it feels to be stabbed in the heart
You wait for me
To explain why
There are tears when I smile
Remove the makeup
But forgot who I am

I used all my strength
To keep you here
You didn’t notice
You were so determined I had to let go in the end
Look into my eyes
The black tears continue to fall

You say you don’t believe
Never paid attention to it
Pretending to be angry
I hate that this is the only way I can get your attention
Girl’s tears
Are often thought to be calculated
Sorry
You actually don’t know me
I promise you
I’ll give you freedom

Hiding in your life
Wanting to have just a corner
But the smaller the strange country
The easier it is to get locked in

The rose is bleeding
Polluting the white snow
Who wants to know
How it feels to be stabbed in the heart
You wait for me
To explain why
There are tears when I smile
Remove the makeup
But forgot who I am

I used all my strength
To keep you here
You didn’t notice
You were so determined I had to let go in the end
Look into my eyes
The black tears continue to fall

You say you don’t believe
Never paid attention to it
Pretending to be angry
I hate that this is the only way I can get your attention
Girl’s tears
Are often thought to be calculated
Sorry
You actually don’t know me
I promise you
I’ll give you freedom
                        
                    |
