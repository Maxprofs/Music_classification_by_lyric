Original / Romaji Lyrics

Shizuka no umi ni hitori 
Hirotta kaigara mimi ni ateta 
Jitto mimi wo sumaseba 
Hora 
Kikoete kuru 
Kimi no MESSEEJI

In a quiet sea, alone, 
I put my ear against a seashell I found. 
When I listen closely, 
aha, 
I can begin to hear 
your message.

Ienakatta omoi wo 
Suna ni kaite wa 
Nami ga saratte yuku

I write onto the sand 
my feelings that I kept from you, 
and let them be carried away by the sand.

Hello Hello 
Koko ni iru yo 
Kono monogatari no hajimari no basho de 
Yakusoku dake ga kurikaeshite mo 
Anata no kioku ni watashi wa zutto ikiteru

Hello Hello 
I'm right here. 
In this place where our story began, 
even if there are nothing but our promises, 
I will always be alive in your memories.

Kioku no umi ni shizumi 
Kuon no toki wo watashi wa yukou 
Koko kara mieru chiisana hoshi to 
Mihatenu sora ni kimi wo omotte



English Translation

Sinking into the sea of memories, 
I'll transcend the eternal time. 
Looking at the miniature planet Earth 
in this boundless universe, I think about you.

Kumo no kirema kagayaku aoi furusato 
Chiheisen ni kieru

My blue hometown, shining through the clouds' crevice, 
disappears into the horizon.

Hello Hello 
Koko ni iru yo 
Kono monogatari no hajimari no basho de 
Doredake toki ga sugiyou tomo 
Anata no kioku ni watashi wa zutto ikiteru

Hello Hello 
I'm right here. 
In this place where our story began, 
no matter how much time should pass, 
I will always be alive in your memories.

Wakusei ga ochiru koro 
Anata to watashi hikareatte 
Kanarazu mata aeru 
Ano yakusoku no basho de

When the planets begin to fall into ruins, 
you and I, pulled by each other's attraction, 
will definitely be able to meet again 
in that place of our promise.

Hello Hello 
Koko ni iru yo 
Denshi wo tadotte hajimari no basho e 
Yakusoku dake ga kurikaeshiteru 
Anata ni au tame tabi wo tsuzukeyou

Hello Hello 
I'm right here. 
Following the electrons, I'm on my way to the place of our beginning. 
I have nothing but our promises, 
but in order to meet you, I'll continue my journey.

Watashi wa sora kara nagare 
Kono monogatari no hajimari no basho e 
Sono toki futatabi aeru darou 
Ano aoi hoshi de anata ni tadoritsuku kara

I flow down from the sky 
towards the place where our story began. 
When I reach there, I should be able to meet you again, 
for I will find my way to you on that blue planet.
                        
                    |
