                        Bài hát: Proud Of You Beat (Giảm Tone) - Fiona Fung

Love in your eyes 
Sitting silence by my side 
Gong in holding hands 
Walking throuth the night 

Hold my up hold me tight 
Lift me up to touch the sky 
Teaching me to love with heart 
Helping me open my mind 

I can fly 
I'm proud that I can fly 
To give the best of mind 
Till the end of the time 
Belive my I can fly 
I'm proud that I can fly 
To give the best of mind 
The heaven in the sky 

Star in the sky 
Wishing once upon the time 
Give me love, Make me smile 
Till the end of life 

Hold my up hold me tight 
Lift me up to touch the sky 
Teaching me to love with heart 
Helping me open my mind 

I can fly 
I'm proud that I can fly 
To give the best of mind 
Till the end of the time 
Belive my I can fly 
I'm proud that I can fly 
To give the best of mind 
The heaven in the sky 

Can't you belive that you light up my way 
No matter that ease my path 
I'll never lose my faith 

See me fly 
I'm proud that I can fly 
Show you the best of mine 
Till the end of the time 

Belive me I can fly 
I'm singing in the sky 
Show you the best of mine 
The heaven of the sky 

Nothing can stop my 
Spread my wings so wide.
                        
                    |
