                        Bài hát: Time For Love - Chris Brown

A material girl
In her own world
Can't even see the things she's missing
Body in the curve
A little girl
Wanting to grow up
And be a star

Take a look around
Without looking down
All these things
Have blurred your vision
Material Things don't amount to nothing

But I know how you feel
It's hard to see whats real

It takes time
Living in a world
when you don't know who to trust
next time
Slow it down and
You'll feel you don't have to rush
It'll be fine
It takes time
It takes time
To love

And Ima tell the truth
When it comes to you
My lady
And its a miracle
You have found a conscience baby

I had plan on leaving
you came and gave a reason
now I know the reason why

But I know how you feel
(You feel)
It's hard to see whats real
(What's real yeah yeah)

It takes time
Living in a world when you don't know who to trust
next time
(next time)
Slow it down and you'll feel you don't have to rush
It'll be fine
(It'll be fine)
It takes time
(Takes time)
It takes time
(Takes time)
To love
