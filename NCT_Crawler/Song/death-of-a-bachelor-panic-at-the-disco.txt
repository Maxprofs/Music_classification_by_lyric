                        Bài hát: Death Of A Bachelor - Panic! at the Disco

Do I look lonely?
I see the shadows on my face
People have told me I don't look the same
Maybe I lost weight
I'm playing hooky, with the best of the best
Put my heart on my chest, so that you can see it too

I'm walking the long road, watching the sky fall
The lace in your dress tingles my neck, how do I live?

The death of a bachelor
Oh Oh Oh
Letting the water fall
The death of a bachelor
Oh Oh Oh
Seems so fitting for
Happily ever after
Oooooh
How could I ask for more?
A lifetime of laughter
At the expense of the death of a bachelor

I'm cutting my mind off
It feels like my heart is going to burst
Alone at a table for two and I just wanna be served
And when you think of me am I the best you've ever had?
Share one more drink with me, smile even though you're sad

I'm walking the long road, watching the sky fall
The lace in your dress tingles my neck, how do I live?

The death of a bachelor
Oh Oh Oh
Letting the water fall
The death of a bachelor
Oh Oh Oh
Seems so fitting for
Happily ever after
Oooooh
How could I ask for more?
A lifetime of laughter
At the expense of the death of a bachelor
