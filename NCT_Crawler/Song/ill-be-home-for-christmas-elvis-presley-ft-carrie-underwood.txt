                        Song: I'll Be Home For Christmas - Elvis Presley, Carrie Underwood

I'll be home for Christmas
You can plan on me
Please have snow and mistletoe
And presents for the tree

Christmas Eve will find me
Where the love light leads
I'll be home for Christmas
If only in my dreams

Christmas Eve will find me
Where the love light leads
I'll be home for Christmas
If only in my dreams

I'll be home for Christmas
                        
                    |
