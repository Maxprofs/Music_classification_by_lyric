                        Battlefield - Jordin Sparks

Don't try to explain your mind 
I know what's happening here 
One minute it's love 
And suddenly it's like a battlefield 

One word turns into a war 
Why is it the smallest things that tear us down? 
My world's nothing when you don't 
I'm not here without a shield 
Can't go back now 

Both hands, tied behind my back for nothing 
Oh no, these times when we climb so fast to fall again 
Why we gotta fall for it now 

I never meant to start a war 
You know I never wanna hurt you 
Don't even know what we're fighting for 

Why does love always feel like a battlefield 
A battlefield, a battlefield? 
Why does love always feel like a battlefield 
A battlefield, a battlefield? 
Why does love always feel like 

Can't swallow our pride 
Neither of us wanna raise that flag 
If we can't surrender then we both gonna lose 
What we had, oh no 

Both hands tied behind my back for nothing 
Oh no, these times when we climb so fast to fall again 
I don't wanna fall for it now 

I never meant to start a war 
You know I never wanna hurt you 
Don't even know what we're fighting for 

Why does love always feel like a battlefield 
A battlefield, a battlefield? 
Why does love always feel like a battlefield 
A battlefield, a battlefield? 

I guess you better go and get your armor 
(Get your armor) 
Get your armor 
I guess you better go and get your armor 
(Get your armor) 
Get your armor 
I guess you better go and get your 

We could pretend that we are friends tonight 
(Oh, oh, oh) 
And in the morning we'll wake up and we'll be alright 
'Cause baby, we don't have to fight 
And I don't want this love to feel like 

A battlefield, a battlefield, a battlefield 
Why does love always feel like a battlefield 
A battlefield, a battlefield 

I guess you better go and get your armor 

I never meant to start a war 
You know I never wanna hurt you 
Don't even know what we're fighting for 
(Fighting, fighting for) 

Why does love always feel like a battlefield 
A battlefield, a battlefield? 
Why does love always feel like a battlefield 
A battlefield, a battlefield? 

I guess you better go and get your armor 
(Get your armor) 
Get your armor 
I guess you better go and get your armor 
(Get your armor) 
Get your armor 

Why does love always feel like? 
Why does love always feel like? 
A battlefield, a battlefield 

I never meant to start a war 
Don't even know what we're fighting for 
I never meant to start a war 
Don't even know what we're fighting for
