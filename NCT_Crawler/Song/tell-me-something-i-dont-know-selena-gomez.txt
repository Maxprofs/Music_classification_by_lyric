                        Tell me something I don’t know! 

Everybody tells me that it’s so hard to make it 
Yet so hard to break it 
And there’s no way to fake it 
Everybody tells me that it’s wrong what I’m feeling 
I shouldn’t believe it 
The dreams that I’m dreaming 
I hear it everyday 
I hear it all the time 
I’m never gonna amount to much 
But they’re never gonna change my mind 
OH! 

Tell me, Tell me, Tell Me 
Something I don’t know x3 
Tell me, tell me, tell me 
Something I don’t know x3 

How many inches in a mile 
What it takes to make you smile 
Getcha not to treat me like a child, baby 

Tell me, tell me, Tell me 
Something I don’t know something x3 
Tell me, Tell me 
Something I don’t know 
Tell me, Tell me 
Something I don’t know 

Everybody tells me 
I Don’t know what I’m doing 
This life I’m pursuing 
The odds of me loosing 
Everybody tells me that it’s one in a million 
More like one in a billion 
Or one in a zillion 
I hear it everyday 
I hear it all the time 
I’m never gonna amount to anything 
But they’re never gonna change my mind 
OH! 

Tell me, tell me, Tell me 
Something I don’t know x3 
Tell me, tell me, Tell me 
Something I don’t know x3 

How many inches in a mile 
What it takes to make you smile 
Getcha not to treat me like a child, baby 
Tell me, Tell me, Tell me 
Something I don’t know x3 

I’m on my way I know 
I’m gonna get there someday 
It doesn’t help when you say 
It won’t be easy 

Tell me, tell me, Tell me 
Something I don’t know x3 
Tell me, tell me, Tell me 
Something I don’t know x3 

How many inches in a mile 
What it takes to make you smile 
Getcha not to treat me like a child, baby 

Tell me, Tell me, Tell me 
Something I don’t know x3
