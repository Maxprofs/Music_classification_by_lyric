                        Hello?
 Remember me?
 Who's there?
 I've got your number
 Oh no, no
 I'm back to haunt you
 No, stay away It's Friday night so creepy outside
 It's thundering and lightning
 There's nobody home 'cause I'm all alone
 It's scary and it's frightening The sound of shoes a shadow that moves
 Something odd is tic tac ticking
 Someone's in here I'm so full of fear
 The telephone is ringing Now I can see you
 Oh no, please no
 Now I can touch you
 Oh God, please go
 I am right here now
 Oh please, tell me where
 I'm in a nightmare
 You better run
 I'm back to haunt you down Halloween, in the death of the night, hear me scream
 I'm coming, I'm coming
 Halloween, is the fear that I fight, in my dream
 Keep running, keep running Just keep running
 Oh, keep on running, yeah
 Just keep running
 Just keep running
 Oh, keep on running, yeah
 Just keep running Hell broke out this Friday night
 Zombies passing deadly
 My Candyman, from Bountyland
 Is coming here to get me Now I can see you
 Oh no, please no
 Now I can touch you
 Oh God, please go
 I am right here now
 Oh please tell me where
 I'm in a nightmare
 You better run
 I'm back to haunt you down Halloween, in the death of the night, hear me scream
 I'm coming, I'm coming
 Halloween, is the fear that I fight, in my dream
 Keep running, keep running Just keep running
 Oh keep on running, yeah
 Just keep running
 Just keep running
 Oh keep on running, yeah
 Just keep running It's squeaking and creaking
 I move silent in the night
 Could be the boy from next-door
 You'll never guess my disguise Kids and children fight
 Pumpkins and candlelight
 You might be the, the chosen one
 At Junior High tonight Halloween, in the death of the night, hear me scream
 I'm coming, I'm coming
 Halloween, is the fear that I fight, in my dream
 Keep running, keep running
 Halloween Just keep running
 Oh, keep on running, yeah
 Just keep running
 Just keep running
 Oh, keep on running, yeah
 Just keep running
