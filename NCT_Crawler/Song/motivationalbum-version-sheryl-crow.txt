                        Little white girl
 In a shiny black car
 Hanging out
 With her friends
 And doing black tar
 Daddy pays
 For the wedding
 With a fist
 Full of dollars
 Cost as much
 As the state
 Of Guatemala

 Oh, why
 Even try?

 Well I got a big car
 And a flat screen tv
 All my loser friends
 And my boyfriend's family
 Bring bags of food
 And watch
 Reality freakshows
 Everybody's faking it
 But nobody thinks so

 Oh, why
 Even try?

 Got no grease on my hands
 Got no serious plans
 Whole world's
 Waiting for me
 'Cause all I gotta do
 Is get it for free

 Chorus:
 Got no reason to bitch
 Ain't no parties
 I've missed
 Got to have it that way
 'Cause baby I got
 Motivation

 Skinny young dude
 In a hundred dollar
 Tee shirt
 In King James kicks
 And a brand new manicure
 Hotties doing pilates
 With the snotties
 And the pleasers
 Sneaking
 In the back door
 At Coconut Teasers

 Why
 Even try?

 Well, I dropped
 Out of school
 When I was seventeen
 'Cause I didn't have time
 To study my magazines
 'Cause there's
 A lot to learn
 From the privileged few
 Like how to build a brand
 Wearing high heeled shoes

 Oh, why
 Even try?

 (Repete 3 verse)

 [Chorus:]

 I'm gonna own this town (3x)
 Yeah, it's all mine

 Oh, why
 Even try?

 (Repete 3 verse)

 [Chorus:]

 (Repete 3 verse)
                        
                    |
