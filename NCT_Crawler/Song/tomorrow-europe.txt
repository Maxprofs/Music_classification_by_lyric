                        Bài hát: Tomorrow - Europe

Will you be there beside me 
if the world falls apart 
and will all of our moments 
remain in your heart 
will you be there to guide me 
all the way through, 
I wonder will you 

Walk by my side, 
and follow my dreams 
and bear with my pride, 
as strong as it seems 
will you be there tomorrow 

Will you be there beside me 
as time goes on by 
and be there to hold me 
whenever I cry 
will you be there to guide me 
all the way through, 
I wonder will you 

Walk by my side, 
and follow my dreams 
and bear with my pride, 
as strong as it seems 
will you be there 
tomorrow
                        
                    |
