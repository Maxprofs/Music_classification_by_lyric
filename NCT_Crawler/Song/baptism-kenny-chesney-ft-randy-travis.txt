                        Song: Baptism - Kenny Chesney, Randy Travis

The summer breeze made ripples on the pond
 It rattled through the reeds, and the willow trees beyond
 Daddy in his good hat and mama in her Sunday dress
 Watched with pride as I stood there, in the water up to my chest And the preacher spoke about the cleansing blood
 As I sank my toes into that cool East Texas mud And it was down with the old man, up with the new
 Raised to walk in the ways of light and truth
 I didn't see no angels, just a few saints on the shore
 But, I felt like a newborn baby, cradled up in the arms of the Lord Amazing grace, oh how sweet the sound
 There was glory in the air, there was dinner on the ground
 And my sins, which were many were washed away and gone
 Along with the Buffalo Nickel, I forgot to leave at home That seemed like such a small, small price to pay
 For the blessed peace of mind that came to me that day It was down with the old man, up with the new
 Raised to walk in the ways of light and truth
 I didn't see no angels, just a few saints on the shore
 But, I felt like a newborn baby, cradled up in the arms of the Lord This road is long and dusty, sometimes the soul, it must be cleansed
 And I long to feel that water rushing over me again I didn't see no angels, just a few saints on the shore
 I felt like a newborn baby, cradled up in the arms of the Lord
 I felt like a newborn baby, cradled up in the arms of the Lord
