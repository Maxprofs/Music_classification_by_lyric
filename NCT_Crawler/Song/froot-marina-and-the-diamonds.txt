                        Bài hát: Froot - Marina and the Diamonds

Froo-oo-oo-oot
La la la la la la la
Ju-u-u-uice
La la la la la la la

I've seen seasons come and go
From winter sun to summer snow
This ain't my first time at the rodeo

Nature ain't a fruit machine
She's got to keep her credits clean
Good things come to those who wait
But I ain't in a patient phase

It's summertime and I hang on the vine
They're gonna make me into sweet red wine
Hanging around like a fruit on a tree
Waiting to be picked
Come on cut me free

Come and fill your cup up
Looking for some good luck
Good luck, good luck to you
Hanging like a fro-oot
Ready to be ju-uiced
Ju-uiced, ju-u-u-uiced

Living la dolce vita
Life couldn't get much sweeter
Don't you give me a reason
That it's not the right season
Babe I love you a lot
I'll give you all I've got
Yeah you know that it's true
I've been saving all my summers for you
I've been saving all my summers for you
Like froo-o-o-oot
Like froo-o-o-oot

Baby I am plump and ripe
I'm pinker than shepherd's delight
Sweet like honeysuckle late at night

Leave it too long I'll go rot
Like an apple you forgot
Birds and worms will come for me
The cycle of life is complete

I'm your carnal flower
I'm your bloody rose
Pick my petals off
And make my heart explode
I'm your deadly nightshade
I'm your cherry tree
You're my one true love
I'm your destiny

Come and fill your cup up
Looking for some good luck
Good luck, good luck to you
Autumn I'll be gone
Birds will sing their mourning song
So-o-o-ong

Living la dolce vita
Life couldn't get much swee-eter
Don't you give me a reason
That it's not the right season
Babe I love you a lot
I'll give you all I've got
Yeah you know that it's true
I've been saving all my summers for you
I've been saving all my summers for you
Like froo-o-o-oot
Like froo-o-o-oot

Oh my body is ready
Yeah it's ready-y
Yeah it's ready-y-yy
For your loo-o-o-o-ove
Oh my branches are heavy-y
Yeah they're heavy-y
Yeah they're heavy-y

Living la dolce vita
Life couldn't get much swee-eter
Don't you give me a reason
That it's not the right season
Babe I love you a lot
I'll give you all I've got
Yeah you know that it's true
I've been saving all my summers for you
I've been saving all my summers for you
Like froo-o-o-oot
Like froo-o-o-oot

Living la dolce vita
I'm in lo-o-o-o-ove
Living la dolce vita
I'm in lo-o-o-o-ove
I'm in lo-o-o-o-ove
