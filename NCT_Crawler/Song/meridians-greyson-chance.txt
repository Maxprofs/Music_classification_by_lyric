                        Bài hát: Meridians - Greyson Chance

Let's go take a drive and think about our lives
Passing through meridians of greater times
I was on a different road
But now I've found my home
Within you
We can kill some time and watch movies all night
Later we'll be talking as the sky turns light
Every morning I spend with you
Cause every night I love the truth

Oh Woah Oh Woah Woah
Oh Woah Oh Woah Woah
Oh Woah Oh Woah Woah
Oh Woah Oh Woah Woah

The timing's never felt so right this feeling's unknown
My love as a Meridian continues to grow
Though the lights that you used to say
Would tie the laugh we make
And now we're creating them

Oh Woah Oh Woah Woah
Oh Woah Oh Woah Woah
Oh Woah Oh Woah Woah
Oh Woah Oh Woah Woah

We're flying to another touch
A life's they've been circled been in us
Kiss my lips and take me there
To hearts I've heard of thoughts unreal
You're so unreal

Let's go take a drive and think about our lives
Passing through meridians of greater times
Greater Times
Greater Times
