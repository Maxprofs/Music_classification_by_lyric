Âu Mỹ khác|

                        I wanna call the stars down from the sky
I wanna live a day that never dies
I wanna change the world only for you
All the impossible I wanna do



I wanna hold you close under the rain
I wanna kiss your smile
And feel the pain.
I know what's beautiful
Looking at you
In a world of lies you are the truth



And baby
Everytime you touch me I become a hero
I'll make you safe no matter where you are and bring you
Everything you ask for nothing is above me
I'm shining like a candle in the dark
When you tell me that you love me


I wanna make you see just what I was
Show you the loneliness
And what it does you walked into my life
To stop my tears everything's easy now
I have you here


And baby
Everytime you touch me
I become a hero I'll make you safe
No matter where you are
And bring you everything you ask for
Nothing is above me
I'm shining like a candle in the dark
When you tell me that you love me
............

In a world without you I would always hunger
All I need is your love to make me stronger
                        
                    |
