I said tell me whats really goin' on
Drizzy back up in this thing I'm ready, what's happenin''
Gone for surgery but now I'm back again,
I'm 'bout my paper like a mutha***in' scratch and win,
World Series attitude, champagne bottle life,
nothing ever changes so tonight is like tomorrow night,
I will have a model wife, your bitch is as hot as ice,
Every time you see me I look like I hit the lotto twice,
(Drake you got 'em, right')
Yeah, I got 'em Bun.
I love myself because I swear their life is just not as fun,
Neks got the weed, Hush got a gun,
CJ's got my credit cards and a lot of ones,
Yeah, I'm in the city of the purple sprite,
Someone tell Maliah I'm on fire, she should work tonight,
Call her King of Diamonds and tell China it'd be worth the flight,
I'll be at my table stacking dollar's to the perfect height,
Work somethin', twirk somethin' basis,
She just tryna make it so she right here gettin' naked
I don't judge her, I don't judge her,
But I could never love her 'cause to her I'm just a rapper
And soon she'll have met another.
That's why me and Lil Jazz 'bout to spaz can you keep up'
I'm just feeling sorry for whoever got to sweep up,
Yeah bills everywhere, trill everything,
And Drake just stand for Do Right And Kill Everything.
I love Nicki Minaj,
I told her I'd admit it,
I hope one day we get married just to say we ***in' did it
And girl I'm ***in' serious, I'm with it if you with it,
'Cause your verses turn me on and your pants are mighty fitted...
Uh, damn.
I think you caught me in a moment,
Like I catch 'em stealing flows, 'cause I swear I never loaned it...
And life ain't a rehearsal, the camera's always rollin',
So come and get a portion of this money that we be blowin',
'Cause it's on'

Yeah girl it's on,

You know what it is when I finally make it home,

I just hope you miss me a little when I'm gone,

Yeah I just hope you miss me a little when I'm gone...

And you just tell me what you down for,

Anything you down for,

I know things have changed,

Know I used to be around more,

But you should miss a little when I'm gone,

I just hope you miss me a little when your gone...
Oooh ***! Mutha***a', ***!
Kickin' bitches out the condo like PAM.
Gettin' money every day, I'm a groundhog,
'Bout to scoop your girl up like a ground ball,
I walk light so I don't piss the ground off,
Man, I swear my bitches do it till they suck the brown off...
Ugh........that's nasty......
Yes, I am Weezy, but I ain't asthmatic.
James Bond cologne, honey I put on,
Make 'em run and tell their friends like a marathon,
Voice baritone, haters carry on,
Beat the pussy up, call me Larry Holmes,
Young Money's Jerry Sloan,
I turn every stone,
She masturbate to me, that's how she learn every song,
To women I condone: better write me when I'm gone,
No I'm not that thuggish, not that ruggish but I do pack bone,
Uhh, I'm a love machine,
And I wont work for nobody but you
It's only me and her 'cause the Bugatti a coupe,
It's Blood Gang slam, but I party with Snoop,
I ain't lyin', I shoot,
You don't need signs for proof,
Turn you to a vegetable like you lining soup,
And when I'm in the booth, ***, the lion is loose,
Man I got so many styles I am a group,
Damn, I'll be gone till November,
*** it I ain't trippin', I know Drizzy gon' kill em',
I'm sticking to the script like lint on denim,
I'mma say it, if the rules ain't bent don't bend em',
Real nigga talkin', shut the *** up ho,
Gotta do it one time for Haiti, what up, Zoe'
Weezy F. Baby and the F is for front door,
'Cause that's where I bring it,
So if you bang it, mutha***a'.
