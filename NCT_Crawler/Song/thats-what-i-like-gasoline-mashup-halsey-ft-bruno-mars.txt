                        Bài hát: That's What I Like - Gasoline (Mashup) - Halsey, Bruno Mars

[Halsey]
Are you insane like me? Been in pain like me? 
Bought a hundred dollar bottle of champagne like me? 
Just to pour that motherfucker down the drain like me? 
Would you use your water bill to dry the stain like me? 

Are you high enough without the Mary Jane like me? 
Do you tear yourself apart to entertain like me? 
Do the people whisper 'bout you on the train like me? 
Saying that you shouldn't waste your pretty face like me? 

[Mars]
Jump in the Cadillac, girl, let's put some miles on it 
Anything you want, just to put a smile on it 
You deserve it baby, you deserve it all 
And I'm gonna give it to you 

[Halsey]
And all the people say

"You can't wake up, this is not a dream
You're part of a machine, you are not a human being
With your face all made up, living on a screen
Low on self esteem, so you run on gasoline." 

[Mars]
That's what I like, that's what I like 
Sex by the fire at night 
Silk sheets and diamonds all white 
Lucky for you, that's what I like, that's what I like 
Lucky for you, that's what I like, that's what I like 

I'm talkin' trips to Puerto Rico 
Say the word and we go 
You can be my freaka 
Girl, I'll be a fleeko, mamacita 
I will never make a promise that I can't keep 
I promise that your smile ain't gon' never leave 

[Halsey]
Are you deranged like me? Are you strange like me? 
Lighting matches just to swallow up the flame like me? 
Do you call yourself a *** hurricane like me? 
Pointing fingers cause you'll never take the blame like me? 

[Mars]
Jump in the Cadillac, girl, let's put some miles on it 
Anything you want, just to put a smile on it 
You deserve it baby, you deserve it all 
And I'm gonna give it to you 

[Halsey]
And all the people say

"You can't wake up, this is not a dream
You're part of a machine, you are not a human being
With your face all made up, living on a screen 
Low on self esteem, so you run on gasoline." 

Oh, oh, oh, oh
I think there's a fault in my code
Oh, oh, oh, oh
These voices won't leave me alone 

If you say you want a good time 
Well here I am baby, here I am baby 
Talk to me, talk to me, talk to me 
Tell me what's on your mind (what's on your mind) 
If you want it, girl come and get it 
All this is here for you 
Tell me baby, tell me, tell me baby 
What you tryna do 

[Halsey ft Mars]
Gold jewelry shining so bright 
Strawberry champagne on ice 
Lucky for you, that's what I like, that's what I like 
Lucky for you, that's what I like, that's what I like 
(And all the people say
"You can't wake up, this is not a dream
You're part of a machine, you are not a human being
With your face all made up, living on a screen, 
Low on self esteem, so you run on gasoline." ) 

[Halsey]
Oh, oh, oh, oh
I think there's a fault in my code
Oh, oh, oh, oh
These voices won't leave me alone
Well my heart is gold, and my hands are cold.
