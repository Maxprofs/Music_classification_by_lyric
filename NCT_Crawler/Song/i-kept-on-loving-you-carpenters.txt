                        Song: I Kept On Loving You - Carpenters

I ran away from you and left you crying
And though I'm back to stay, you think I'm lying
But I've changed my ways, my wandering days are through
Through it all, I kept on loving you

Don't worry baby, please don't cry
I'm home for good and I will never leave you

Don't worry baby, please don't cry
You must believe me and I will never leave you
Never leave you

You've heard this song before, I can't deny it
The road is long and wide, I had to try it
Though I love you girl, these were things I had to do
Through it all, I kept on loving you

Don't worry baby, please don't cry
I'm home for good and I will never leave you

Don't worry baby, please don't cry
You must believe me and I will never leave you
Never leave you

Don't worry baby, please don't cry
I'm home for good and I will never leave you

Don't worry baby please don't cry
You must believe me and I will never leave you
Never leave you

Don't worry baby, please don't cry
I'm home for good and I will never leave you.
