                        Bài hát: I Love U, I Hate U - Conor Maynard

Feeling used but i’m
Still missing you
And i can’t see the end of this
Just wanna feel your kiss
Against my lips
And now all this time is passing by
But i still can’t seem to tell you why
It hurts me every time i see you
Realize how much i need you
I hate you i love you
I hate that i love you
Dont want to,but i cant put
Nobody else above you
I hate you i love you
I hate that i want you
You want her,you need her
And i’ll never her
I miss you when i cant sleep
Or right after coffee
Or right when i cant eat
I miss you in front seat
Still got sand in my sweaters
From night we dont remember
Do you miss me like i miss you?
Messed around and got attached to you
Friends can break your heart too,
I’m always tired but never of you
If i treated you like a you wouldnt like that
Held out my hand for you
But you didnt touch that
I wrote a text but then
I deleted that
I got these feelings but
You didnt realize that
Oh,oh
Keep it on the low
Youre still in love with me
But your friends dont know
If you want me you would just say so
And if i were you,
I would never let me go
I hate you i love you
I hate that i love you
Dont want to,but i cant put
Nobody else above you
I hate you i love you
I hate that i want you
You want her,you need her
And i’ll never her
So forget that new girl
That you love so bad
I khow you still think
About the times we had
I said forget that new girl
That you think you found
And since you picked up
I know he's not around
Im just sayin
You could do better
Tell me have heard that lately
Im just sayin
You could do better
And i’ll start hating on me
If you make me
