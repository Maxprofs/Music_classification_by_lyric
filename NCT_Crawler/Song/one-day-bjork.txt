                        One day
 It will happen
 One day, one day
 It will all come true One day
 When you're ready
 One day, one day
 When you're up to it The atmosphere
 Will get lighter
 And two suns ready
 To shine just for you I can feel it
 I can feel it One day
 It will happen
 One day, one day
 It will all make sense One day
 It will blossom
 One day, one day
 When you're ready An aeroplane
 Will curve gracefully
 Around the volcano
 With the eruption
 That never lets you down I can feel it
 I can feel it And the beautifulness
 Fireworks will burn in
 In the sky
 Oh just for you I can feel it
 I can feel it One day
 One day
 One day
 One day
                        
                    |
