                        Bài hát: Honey, Honey - V.A

Honey honey, how he thrills me, ah hah, honey honey
Honey honey, nearly kills me, ah hah, honey honey
I'd heard about him before, I wanted to know some more
And now I know what they mean, he's a love machine
Oh, he makes me dizzy

Honey honey, let me feel it, ah hah, honey honey
Honey honey, don't conceal it, ah hah, honey honey
The way that you kiss goodnight
(The way that you kiss me goodnight)
The way that you hold me tight
(The way that you're holding me tight)
I feel like I wanna sing when you do your thing

{I want my Dad to give me away at my wedding
But according to Mom's diary I've got three possible Dads
Sam, Bill or Harry
[Incomprehensible] Do they know?
What you write to total strangers?
'Come to my wedding, you might be my Dad'
No, they think Mom's sent the invitations
And after reading this diary, I'm not surprised they all said yes!}

Honey honey, how he thrilled me, ah hah, honey honey
Honey honey, nearly killed me, ah hah, honey honey
I'd heard about him before, I wanted to know some more
And now I'm about to see what he mean to me
                        
                    |
