Westlife--Queen Of My Heart

So here we stand
In our secret place
With the sound of the crowd
So far away
And you take my hand
And it feels like home
We both understand
Its where we belong
So how do I say
Do I say goodbye
We both have our dream
We both wanna fly
So lets take tonight
To carry us through
The lonely times
Ill always look back
As I walk away
This memory will last
For eternity
And all of our tears
Will be lost in the rain
When I find my way back
To your arms again
But until that day
You know you are
The queen of my heart
The queen of my heart
So lets take tonight
And never let go
While dancing we'll kiss
Like theres no tomorrow
As the stars sparkle down
Like a diamond ring
Ill treasure this moment
Till we meet again
But no matter how far
Away you may be
I just close my eyes
And your in my dreams
And there you will be
Until we meet
Ill always look back
As I walk away
This memory will last
For eternity
And all of our tears
Will be lost in the rain
When I find my way back
To your arms again
But until that day
You know you are
The queen of my heart
Ill always look back
As I walk away [I walk away]
This memory will last
For eternity [eternity]
And all of our tears [our tears]
Will be lost in the rain [will be lost in the rain]
When I find my way back
To your arms again
But until that day
You know you are
The queen of my heart
Oh, yeah
Your the queen of my heart [queen of my heart]
No matter, amazing tale
I'd give it all to you
Oh yeah [queen of my heart]
Oh yes you are
The queen of my heart......
