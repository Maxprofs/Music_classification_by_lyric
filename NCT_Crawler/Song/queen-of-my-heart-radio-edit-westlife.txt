                        So here we stand 
In our secret place 
Where the sound of the crowd 
Is so far away 
You take my hand 
And it feels like home 
We both understand 
It's where we belong 

So how do I say 
Do I say goodbye 
We both have our dreams 
We both wanna fly 
So let's take tonight 
To carry us through 
The lonely times 

I'll always look back 
As I walk away 
This memory will last for eternity 
And all of our tears 
Will be lost in the rain 
When I find my way back 
To your arms again 
But until that day 
You know you are 
The queen of my heart 

So let's take tonight 
And never let go 
While dancing we'll kiss 
Like there's no tomorrow 
As the stars sparkle down 
Like a diamond ring 
I'll treasure this moment 
Till we meet again 

But no matter how far (no matter how far) 
Or where you may be (where you may be) 
I just close my eyes (just close my eyes) 
And you're in my dreams 
And there you will be 
Until we meet 

I'll always look back 
As I walk away 
This memory will last for eternity 
And all off our tears 
Will be lost in the rain 
When I find my way back 
To your arms again 
But until that day 
You know you are 
The queen of my heart 

I'll always look back 
As I walk away 
This memory will last for eternity 
And all off our tears 
Will be lost in the rain 
When I find my way back 
To your arms again 
But until that day 
You know you are 
The queen of my heart 

Oh yeah 
You're the queen of my heart (queen of my heart) 
No matter how many years it takes (queen of my heart) 
i'm coming home to you 
Oh yeah (queen of my heart) 
Oh yes you are 
The queen of my heart
                        
                    |
