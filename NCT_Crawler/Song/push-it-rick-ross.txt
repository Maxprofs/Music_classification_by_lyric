                        Ross Port of Miami
 Port of my candy
 Ain't got nothing to lose (nah)
 We suppotin' the family
 Never traffic for fun (fun)
 Only traffic for funds (funds)
 All I seen was the struggle (struggle)
 Its like I'm trapped in this slum
 Niggas were badly paid
 No water we barely bathed
 Better be better days on the way
 That's on my damn grave
 I'm pushing it hard (hard)
 I'm pushing it south (south)
 If he pushing a line (line)
 He pushin for Ross (Ross)
 I waited and waited (waited)
 I done ran outta patience (patience)
 They hated and hated
 Left 'em slow dancing with Satan
 Fresh in my white tee
 Mac eleven swear to god
 I bought my first block
 Broke it down and tore the block apart [Chorus]
 I push and I push (Push)
 I ride and I ride (ride)
 Trying' to survive on 95
 Put it all on the line (line)
 At the drop of a dime (dime)
 I be pushing them whips (whips)
 Yes, three at a time
 I'm pushing it (Push)
 I'm pushing it (Push)
 I'm pushing it (Push)
 I gotta
 I'm pushing it (Push)
 I'm pushing it (Push)
 I'm pushing it (Push)
 I gotta I handle dope like a Vandal off the banana boat
 Bananas and the rifles
 No cyphers I'm just the man to know
 I paid dues my moves done made moves
 I'm smooth my suede shoes
 They new like ?
 Nobody used to speak (speak)
 Now everybody wave (wave)
 You dunk your mama house (house)
 You set your sister straight (straight)
 I'm building a dream (dream)
 With elevators in it
 Tell who made the linen
 No gators got on my hater vision
 I see ya, I see ya suckers (suckers)
 I see ya clear (clear)
 I know you see me in that phantom
 Whiter then veneers
 Allergic to broke (broke)
 Determined to blow (blow)
 On the boat we hit the working detergent and soap
 We ship it from Haiti
 Baby I'm whipping them baby's
 Let it dry later try to whip a Mercedes
 Arrange my Range (Range)
 Y'all can't arrange a parade (parade)
 You gotta push it to the limit
 If you wanna be paid [Chorus] We started minute
 The money matured
 My money secured
 I got bunnies in Europe
 My bubbles be pure
 Cost like a hundred a pour
 The world is yours
 Hundred million and more
 Now I run the streets (Ross)
 They all mine (Ross)
 Twelve years over due
 Call it two time
 I told you never roll on the soul of a soldier
 You never know that dishwasher may be a beholder
 Who ever thought that fat girl would grow into Oprah
 Or that boy Rick Ross would be moldin' the culture
 I push and I push (Push)
 We breaking the mold (mold)
 We push and we push (Push)
 We breaking the hold [Chorus]
                        
                    |
