                        Bài hát: Freedom! '90 - The Bellas

[Verse 1]
Heaven knows I was just a young boy
Didn't know what I wanted to be
I was every little hungry schoolgirl's pride and joy
And I guess it was enough for me
To win the race, a prettier face
Brand new clothes and a big fat place
On your rock and roll TV
But today the way I play the game is not the same, no way
Think I'm gonna get me some happy

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I think there's something you should know
(I think it's time I told you so)
There's something deep inside of me
(There's someone else I've got to be)
Take back your picture in a frame
(Take back your singing in the rain)
I just hope you understand
Sometimes the clothes do not make the man

[Chorus]
All we have to do now
Is take these lies and make them true, somehow
All we have to see
Is that I don't belong to you
And you don't belong to me, yeah

Freedom, I won't let you down
Freedom, I will not give you up
Freedom, gotta have some faith
Gotta have some faith in the sound

[Verse 2]
Heaven knows we sure had some fun, boy
What a kick, just a buddy and me
We had every big-shot good-time band on the run, boy
We were living in a fantasy
We won the race, got out of the place
Went back home, got a brand new face for the boys on MTV
But today the way I play the game has got to change, oh yeah
Now I'm gonna get me some happy

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I think there's something you should know
(I think it's time I stopped the show)
There's something deep inside of me
(There's someone I forgot to be)
Take back your picture in a frame
(Don’t think that I’ll be back again)
I just hope you understand
Sometimes the clothes do not make the man

[Chorus]
All we have to do now
Is take these lies and make them true, somehow
All we have to see
Is that I don't belong to you
And you don't belong to me

Freedom, I won't let you down
Freedom, I will not give you up
Freedom, gotta have some faith
Gotta have some faith in the sound

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I think there's something you should know
(I think it's time I told you so)
There's something deep inside of me
(There's someone else I've got to be)
Take back your picture in a frame
(Take back your singing in the rain)
I just hope you understand
Sometimes the clothes do not make the man

[Break]
Eh eh eh eh eh (Oh)
Eh eh eh eh eh (I will not let you down)
Eh eh eh eh eh
Eh~

[Chorus (abridged)]
Freedom
Freedom
Freedom (Freedom, freedom)
Gotta have some faith in the sound

Have some freedom (Have some freedom, oh)
Freedom
Freedom (Freedom)

[Chorus]
All we have to do now (All we can do)
Is take these lies and make them true somehow
All we have to see (Oh~)
Is that I don't belong to you
And you don't belong to me (Freedom)

[Outro]
I won't let you down
I will not give you up
Gotta have some faith in the sound
It's the one good thing that I've got

I won't let you down
I will not give you up
It's the one good thing that I've got
                        
                    |
