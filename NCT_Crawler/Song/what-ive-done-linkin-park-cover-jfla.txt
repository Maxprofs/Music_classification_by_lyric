                        Bài hát: What I've Done (Linkin Park Cover) - J.Fla

In this farewell 
There’s no blood 
There’s no alibi 
‘cause i’ve drawn regret 
From the truth 
Of a thousand lies 

[Pre-chorus:] 
So let mercy come 
And wash away 
What i’ve done 

[Chorus:] 
I'll face myself 
To cross out what i’ve become 
Erase myself 
And let go of what i’ve done 

Put to rest 
What you thought of me 
While i clean this slate 
With the hands of uncertainty 

[Pre-chorus] 

[Chorus] 

For what i’ve done 
I start again 
And whatever pain may come 
Today this ends 
I’m forgiving what i’ve done!!! 

[Chorus] 

What i’ve done 
Forgiving what i’ve done
                        
                    |
