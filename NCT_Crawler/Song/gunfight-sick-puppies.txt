                        Here's a little story how the west was won
 They wound up killing every little engine
 They used dirty blankets and they used machine guns
 And they didn't think twice about what they'd done Here's a little story about Kevin Bacon
 He had a bunch of money but it got taken
 He got a bunch of lawyers and he tried to sue
 But Bernie looked him and said "HEY, *** YOU!" Don't bring a knife to a gun fight, you'll lose.
 Don't bring a knife to a gun fight, you'll lose. Here's a little story about the congressmen
 They bailed out all of their billionaire friends
 You can blame Bush, or you can try to blame Obama
 But you should've freakin' learned from your daddy or your momma Don't bring a knife to a gun fight, you'll lose. Some fights just ain't fair
 Some fights just ain't fair
 Some fights just ain't fair
 You don't bring a knife to a gun fight, you'll lose! Here's a little story about Tienanmen Square
 The people rose up and said "Life ain't fair."
 Now they're sweating in a shop making iPhones and
 You stand in front of tanks, the tanks are gonna win! Don't bring a knife to a gun fight, you'll lose.
 Don't bring a knife to a gun fight, you'll lose. Don't bring a knife to a gun fight, you'll lose.
 Don't bring a knife
 Don't bring a knife, you'll lose.
