                        Bài hát: I See Fire - Jasmine Thompson

Oh Misty eye of the mountain below, 
Keep careful watch of my brothers souls, 
And should the sky be filled with fire and smoke 
Keep watching over Durin's sons. 

If this is to end in fire 
Then we should all burn together 
Watch the flames climb high into the night. 
Calling out Father Oh 
Stand by and we will 
Watch the flames burn on, 
burn on the mountainside 


And if we should die tonight 
Then we should all die together 
Raise a glass of wine 
For the last time 
Calling out Father Oh 
Prepare as we will 
Watch the flames burn on burn on the mountainside 
Desolat ion comes upon the sky 

Now I see fire 
Inside the mountain 
I see fire 
Burning the trees 
And I see fire 
Hollow in soul 
I see fire 
Blood in the breeze 
And I hope that you remember me 


I'll Cover my eyes 
For if the dark returns 
Then my brothers will die 
And as the sky is falling down 
It crashed into this lonely town 
And with that shadow upon the ground 
I hear my people screaming out 

I see fire 
Inside the mountain 
I see fire 
Burning the trees 
And I see fire 
Hollow in soul 
And I see fire burn on, 
burn on the mountainside
                        
                    |
