                        Bài hát: Dontcha - The Internet

[Verse 1:]
I can be your fantasy, while you're dancing alone tonight (yea)
Or you can be my majesty, got me running for you
Said we ain't got to take it slow
Here's what you do to me (yea)
I think it's time to take control
Girl I just want to love you

[Bridge:]
Bad as you want to give it I want to give it to you
I know you won't admit it and at least I know the truth
The way you move around me is something seductive too
Got a place we can go if you're down
Let's go all the way (yea)

[Hook: x2]
Cause basically I, I just wanna ride with you
I gotta get ya, cause I just wanna vibe with you
Let's find some place to go, cause I just gotta to know if you want me too
Don't you want me?

[Verse 2:]
Swimming through your galaxy, starstruck on all of you (Yea)
Perfect love analogy, that's how I describe you

[Bridge:]
Bad as you want to give it I want to give it to you
I know you won't admit it and at least I know the truth
The way you move around me is something seductive too
Got a place we can go if you're down
Let's go all the way (yea)

[Hook: x2]
Cause basically I, I just wanna ride with you
I gotta get ya, cause I just wanna vibe with you
Let's find some place to go, cause I just gotta to know if you want me too
Don't you want me?

(Yea)

[Outro:]
Dontcha dontcha dontcha dontcha want me?
Dontcha dontcha dontcha want me?
Dontcha dontcha dontcha want me?
Dontcha dontchaaa...
Dontcha dontcha dontcha dontcha want me?
Dontcha dontcha dontcha want me?
Dontcha dontcha dontcha want me?
Dontcha dontchaaa...
