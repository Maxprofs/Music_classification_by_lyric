Mother, you had me but I never had you
I wanted you but you didn't want me

[Chorus]
So I got i just got to tell you
Goodbye, goodbye
[Verse 2]
Father, you left me but I never left you
I needed you you didn't need me

[Chorus]
So I got i just got to tell you
Goodbye, goodbye

Children, don't do what I have done
I couldn't walk so I tried to run

[Chorus]
So I got i just got to tell you
Goodbye goodbye
