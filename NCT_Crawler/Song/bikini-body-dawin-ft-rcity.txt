                        Bài hát: Bikini Body - Dawin, R.City

[Verse 1]
Baby, all I'm saying, simple is better
And the size don't matter, you could wear whatever
(wear that you want)
If the sun ain't shining, let's light it up together
(light it up)
Don't care what kind of shape you in
Spin around, show it off, I'm ok with it
Can't nobody touch you 'cause you hotter than a sauna
(you hotter than a sauna)
Don't be hiding that body, it's a gift from your mama
(gift from your mama)
Baby, it's your party, you can do what you wanna
You got it, girl, have faith in it
The moves they got, we breakin' 'em

[Chorus: Dawin]
First things first, you got it goin' on
The smile on your face really gets me lost
The world ain't a prison, girl, be free
I'm just saying you should show off that bikini body

[Post-Chorus: Dawin]
Show it off, girl, show it off
Get loose with it
That-that-that bikini body
Show it off, girl, show it off
Get loose with it
That-that-that bikini body

[Verse 2]
Polka dot or stripe, girl, it really don't matter
Cause if you sweet like candy, I ain't lookin' at the wrapper
The way you carry yourself, girl, got 'em all comin' at ya
No time to feel uncomfortable
Don't change 'cause you're untouchable, yeah
I remember, you was summertime fine in December
You were hot like a real bad temper
Superbad, girl, I wonder who sent ya
I remember, had a playa fallin' down like timber
How you twist and you bend, so limber
Every time you come around, I gotta tell ya

[Chorus: Dawin]
First things first, you got it goin' on
The smile on your face really gets me lost
The world ain't a prison, girl, be free
I'm just saying you should show off that bikini body

[Post-Chorus: Dawin]
Show it off, girl, show it off
Get loose with it
That-that-that bikini body
Show it off, girl, show it off
Get loose with it
That-that-that bikini body

[Verse 3: R. City]
Go ahead and get loose
Shake it, shake it, big bruce, bruce
And you can bring your homegirl, too
Every single one of y'all, come through
In your polka dot bikini, [?] teeny weeny
Oh oh oh, shawty, let me see it
In your polka dot bikini, [?] teeny weeny
Oh oh oh, shawty, let me see it
Dawin, tell 'em

[Chorus: Dawin]
First things first, you got it goin' on
The smile on your face really gets me lost
The world ain't a prison, girl, be free
I'm just saying you should show off that bikini body

[Post-Chorus: Dawin]
Show it off, girl, show it off
Get loose with it
That-that-that bikini body
Show it off, girl, show it off
Get loose with it
That-that-that bikini body
