                        I walk a lonely road
The only one that I have ever known
Don?t know where it goes
But it's home to me and I walk alone

Today is gonna be the day
That they're gonna throw it back to you

I walk this empty street
On the Boulevard of Broken Dreams
Where the city sleeps
And I'm the only one and I walk alone

By now you should've somehow
Realized what you gotta do (I walk alone, I walk alone)
I don't believe that anybody
Feels the way I do about you now (I walk alone, I walk alone)

My shadow's the only one that walks beside me
My shallow heart's the only thing that's beating
Sometimes I wish someone out there will find me
'Til then I walk alone

Every day I wake up and it's Sunday
Whatever's in my head won't go away
The radio is playing all the usual
And what's a wonderwall anyway

Backbeat the word is on the street
That the fire in your heart is out
I'm sure you've heard it all before
But you never really had a doubt
I don't believe that anybody feels
The way I do about you now

I'm walking down the line
That divides me somewhere in my mind
On the border line
Of the edge and where I walk alone

Today is gonna be the day
That they're gonna throw it back to you

Read between the lines
What's *ed up and everything's alright
Check my vital signs
To know I'm still alive and I walk alone

Today is gonna be the day
That they're gonna throw it back to you (I walk alone, I walk alone)
By now you should've somehow
Realized what you gotta do (I walk alone, I walk alone)

And all the roads we have to walk are winding
And all the lights that lead us there are blinding
There are many things that I would
Like to say to you
But I don't know how

I walk this empty street
On the Boulevard of Broken Dreams

Today is gonna be the day
That they're gonna throw it back to you

I walk this empty street
On the Boulevard of Broken Dreams

By now you should've somehow
Realized what you gotta do

Where the city sleeps
and I'm the only one and I walk alone

Because maybe
My shadow's the only one that walks beside me (You're gonna be the one that saves me)
My shallow heart's the only thing that's beating (You're gonna be the one that saves me)
Sometimes I wish someone out there will find me (You're gonna be the one that saves me)
'Til then I walk alone

Sing with me (sing)
Sing for the year (sing)
Sing for the laughter, sing for the tear
Sing with me, if it?s just for today
Maybe tomorrow the good lord will take you away
                        
                    |
