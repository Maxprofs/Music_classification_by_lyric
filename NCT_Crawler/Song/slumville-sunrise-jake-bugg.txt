Rock|

                        The wind keeps beating on my window
 I haven't slept all night
 That drum just keeps on bangin'
 They must be buzzin' out their minds
 Like bees in a hive, tell me when the morning arrives This place is just not for me
 I say it all the time
 My friends they just ignore me tell me never mind
 Waiting all your life on a slumville sunrise Slumville sunrise
 Nobody cares or looks twice
 Shine away in the morning across this place I was born in
 Every bruise every flower illuminated by the dawnin' My face upon the concrete
 The dirt is in my mouth
 I clench my fists and feet
 I'm trying to cry out loud
 Make a sound, but something is keeping me down This place is just not for me I say it a thousand times
 My friends they just ignore me tell me never mind
 Waiting all your life on a slumville sunrise Slumville sunrise
 Nobody cares or looks twice
 Shine away in the morning across this place I was born in
 Every bruise every flower illuminated by the dawnin' This place is just not for me I say it all the time
 My friends they just ignore me tell me never mind
 Waiting all your life on a slumville sunrise Slumville sunrise
 Nobody cares or looks twice
 Shine away in the morning across this place I was born in
 Every bruise every flower illuminated by the dawnin'
                        
                    |
