Blues/Jazz|

                        There is no greater love
 Than what I feel for you
 No greater love
 No heart so true

 There is no greater thrill
 Than what you bring to me
 No sweeter song than
 What you sing to me

 You're the sweetest thing
 I have ever known
 And to think
 That you are mine alone

 There is no greater
 Love in all the world
 It's true
 No greater love than
 What I feel for you
                        
                    |
