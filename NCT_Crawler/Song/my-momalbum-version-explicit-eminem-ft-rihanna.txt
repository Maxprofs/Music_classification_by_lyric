                        Here we go now...

 Chorus 1:
 My mom loved Valium and lots of drugs
 That's why I am like I am 'cause I'm like her
 Because my mom loved Valium and lots of drugs
 That's why I'm on what I'm on 'cause I'm my mom

 Verse 1:
 My mom, my mom,
 I know you're probably tired of hearing 'bout my mom
 Oho whoa-ho,
 But this is just a story of when I was just a shorty
 And how I became hooked on val-i-um.
 Valium was in everything, food that I ate
 The water that I drank
 *** peas in my plate
 She sprinkled just enough of it to season my steak
 So everyday I have at least 3 stomach aches
 Now tell me what kind of mother would want to see her
 Son grow up to be an under-a-***-chiever
 My teacher didn't think I was going to be nothing either
 What the *** you stickin' gum up under the ***in' seat for?
 Misses Mathers your son has been huffin' ether
 Either that or the mother ***er's been puffin' reefer
 But all this huffin' and puffin' wasn't what it was either
 It was neither,
 I was buzzin' but it wasn't what she thought
 Pee in a tea-cup? Bitch you ain't my keeper
 I'm sleepin'
 What the *** you keep on ***in' with me for?
 S*** you need to leave me the *** alone
 I ain't playin'go find you a white crayon
 And color a ***in' zebra

 Chorus 2:
 My mom loved Valium and lots of drugs
 That's why I am like I am 'cause I'm like her
 Because my mom loved Valium and lots of drugs
 That's why I'm on what I'm on 'cause I'm my mom

 Verse 2:
 Wait a minute, this ain't dinner, this is paint thinner
 You ate it yesterday I ain't hear no complaints did I?
 Now here's a plate full of painkillers
 Now just wait til I crush the Valium and put it in your potatoes
 Ya little mother ***er,
 I'll make ya sit there and make that retarded ***in' face without even tastin' it
 You better lick the ***in' plate, you ain't wastin' it
 Put ya face in it before I throw you in the basement again
 And I aint givin in you're gonna just sit there in one ***in place spinnin in
 Until next thanksgivin and if you still aint finished it I'll use the same *** again
 Then when I make spinach dip it'll be placed in the ***
 You little *** you want to sit there and play innocent
 A rack fell and hit me at K-Mart and they witnessed it
 Child support, your father he ain't sent the ***
 And so what if he did? It's none of your dang business kid.

 Chorus 3:
 My mom, there's no one else quite like my mom
 I know I should let bygones be bygones
 But she's the reason why I am high on what I'm high on
 My mom loved Valium and lots of drugs
 That's why I am like I am 'cause I'm like her
 Because my mom loved Valium and lots of drugs
 That's why I'm on what I'm on 'cause I'm my mom

 Verse 3:
 My mom loved valium now all I am is a poly-animal
 I am what I am but I'm strong to be finished with me valium spinach
 But my buzz only lasts about two minutes
 But I don't want to swallow it without chewing it
 I can't even write a rhyme without doin' it
 My valium, my valium
 Man I never thought that I could ever be a drug addict
 Nah *** that, I can't have it happen to me
 But that's actually what has ended up happenin'
 A tragedy from *** passin it up got to me
 And it's probably were I got acquainted with the taste aint it
 Pharmaceuticals are the bomb mom beautiful
 She killed the *** dog with the medicine she done fed it
 Feed it a *** aspirin and say that it has a headache
 Here, want a snack?
 You hungry you *** brat?
 Look at that, it's a Xanax.
 Take it and take a nap, eat it,
 But I don't need it.
 Then *** it then break it up
 Take a little piece and beat it before you wake Nathan up
 Alright ma, you win I don't feel like arguin'
 I'll do it, pop it gobble it and start wobblin'
 Stumble hobble tumble slip drip
 Then I fall in bed with a bottle of meds
 And a Heath Ledger bobblehead

 Chorus 4:
 My mom loved Valium and lots of drugs
 That's why I am like I am 'cause I'm like her
 Because my mom loved Valium and lots of drugs
 That's why I'm on what I'm on 'cause I'm my mom
