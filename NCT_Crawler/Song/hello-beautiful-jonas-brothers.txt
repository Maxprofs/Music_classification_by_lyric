                        Hello Beautiful
How's it going?
I hear it's wonderful in California
I've been missing you it's true
But tonight I'm gonna fly
Yea tonight I'm gonna fly
'cause I could go across the world
See everything and never be satisfied
If I couldn't see those eyes
Hello Beautiful
It's been a long time
Since my phone's rung
And you've been on that line
I've been missing you it's true
But tonight I'm gonna fly
Yea tonight I'm gonna fly
'cause I could go across the world
See everything and never be satisfied
If I couldn't see those eyes
