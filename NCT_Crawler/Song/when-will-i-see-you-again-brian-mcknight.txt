                        Can't believe the daily news
 It's mostly bad it's sad but true
 I realize how close the end is near
 The world is sinking down so low
 More wicked than the days of Noah
 Lord, we need You now that much is true Lord, You said that you would come
 And wipe away all tears, oh Lord
 It's been two thousand years since You were here Lord, since You've been gone, every thing's gone wrong
 Just like You said that it would do
 But Lord, I still believe You're comin' back for me
 To take me home to live with You
 Waitin' day and night, for You to crack the sky
 We're comin' to the end
 Tell me when will I see You again, my Lord?
 Tell me when will I see You again? So many have no place to stay
 Our children have no place to play
 It's against the law to pray in school
 I'm waiting for the day to come when
 Every eye shall see the sun
 Till then I'm gonna do what I gotta do Lord, You said that you would come
 And wipe away all tears, oh Lord
 It's been two thousand years since You were here Lord, since You've been gone, every thing's gone wrong
 Just like You said that it would do
 But Lord, I still believe You're comin' back for me
 To take me home to live with You
 Waitin' day and night, for You to crack the sky
 We're comin' to the end
 Tell me when will I see You again, my Lord?
 Tell me when will I see You again? You died for us once before
 Sacrificed Your life upon the cross, yeah
 Oh Lord, will You be comin' in the noon day sky
 Or will You arrive like a thief in the night? Lord, since You've been gone, every thing's gone wrong
 Just like You said that it would do
 But Lord, I still believe You're comin' back for me
 To take me home to live with You
 Waitin' day and night, for You to crack the sky
 I know we're comin' to the end
 Tell me when will I see You again, my Lord?
 Tell me when will I see You again? Lord, since You've been gone, every thing's gone wrong
 Just like You said that it would do
 But Lord, I still believe You're comin' back for me
 To take me home to live with You
 Waitin' day and night, for You to crack the sky
 I know we're comin' to the end
 Tell me when will I see You again, my Lord?
 Tell me when will I see You again?
 When will I see you again?
