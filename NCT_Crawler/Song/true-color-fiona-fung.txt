                        In a world full of people
you can lose sight of it and, darkness inside you
makes you fell so small

but i see your true colors
shinning through
i see your true colors
and that's why ilove you
so don't be afraid to let them show
your true colors
true colors are beautiful
like a rainbow

if this world makes you crazy
and you've taken all you can bear
just call me up
because you know i be there

and i'll see your true colors 
shinning through
i see your true colors 
and that's why i love you
so don't be afraid to let them show
your true colors
true colors are beautiful
like a rainbow.
