                        Been sittin', thinkin' 'bout you
 And I am wonderin' why we're not gettin' along
 So frustrated 'cause what we had was a happy home I don't know what the situation is
 But I can tell in the way we kiss
 We don't talk no more, it feels better when Im alone Sometimes I feel like there's no gettin' through to you
 Like you don't appreciate all that I do
 You gotta show me that you want me to stay
 Don't turn and walk away Baby, Im slowly fallin' out of love with you
 I don't know what to do
 How did we end up here this way?
 What are we gonna do? Im slowly falling out
 Baby, were trippin' on silly things
 Boy, I need you to meet me half way
 If you want me to be with you I remember when I be with my friends
 You checked on me and made time to call
 But how things have changed
 Now I don't hear from you at all, yeah, yeah Sometimes I feel like there's no gettin' through to you
 Like you don't appreciate all that I do
 You gotta show me that you want me to stay
 Don't turn and walk away Baby, Im slowly fallin' out of love with you
 I don't know what to do
 How did we end up here this way?
 What are we gonna do? Im slowly falling out
 Baby, we're trippin' on silly things
 Boy, I need you to meet me half way
 If you want me to be with you Don't let your pride get in the way
 On somethin' we worked so hard, don't throw it away
 Ive been tryin' to make you see
 Everything you need is right here with me Sometimes I feel like there's no gettin' through to you
 Like you don't appreciate all that I do
 You gotta show me that you want me to stay
 Don't turn and walk away
 (Baby, I'm slowly)
 Don't turn and walk away Baby, Im slowly fallin' out of love with you
 I don't know what to do
 How did we end up here this way?
 What are we gonna do? Im slowly falling out
 Baby, we're trippin' on silly things
 Boy, I need you to meet me half way
 If you want me to be with you Im tired of givin' my all
 (Slowly fallin', slowly fallin')
 How did we end up here this way?
 I just wanna know what are we gonna do? Slowly fallin', slowly fallin', slowly fallin'
 How did we end up here this way?
 What are we gonna do? Slowly fallin', slowly fallin'
 How did we end up here this way?
 What are we gonna do? Yeah Slowly fallin', slowly fallin'
 How did we end up here this way?
 I just wanna know what are we gonna do?
