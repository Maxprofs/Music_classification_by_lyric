                        Bài hát: Wiser - Madilyn Bailey

I thought that it was safe to die inside your arms 
I let you in I let you see this naked heart 
Lesson learned sometimes love goes behind your back 
I guess that's just the way we find out who we are 
Was it all worth it?

I'm wiser from the mess you made I feel no pain 
Wiser from the storms I braved yeah I want to say 
Thank you thank you 
For breaking my heart showing me who you are 
I'm wiser from the waves you made 
Wiser 

It melts away the price I pay to taste your love 
No more shame those embers they just burn to dust 
Turning pages bruises fade and I made it through the deep
I earned my stripes from battle cries this skin is thick 
Was it all worth it?

I'm wiser from the mess you made I feel no pain 
Wiser from the storms I braved yeah I want to say 
Thank you thank you 
For breaking my heart showing me who you are 
I'm wiser from the waves you made 
Wiser 

Thank you for making it harder 
I learned to keep my head above the water 
Because of you I will always be a survivor 
Boy it was worth it 

I'm wiser from the mess you made I feel no pain 
Wiser from the storms I braved yeah I want to say 
Thank you thank you 
For breaking my heart showing me who you are 
I'm wiser from the waves you made 

Thank you

I'm wiser from the mess you made I feel no pain 
Wiser from the storms I braved yeah I want to say 
Thank you thank you 
For breaking my heart showing me who you are 
I'm wiser from the waves you made 
Wiser
