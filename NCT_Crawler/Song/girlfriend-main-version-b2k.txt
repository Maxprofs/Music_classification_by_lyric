                        I got everything I want in my life except a girlfriend
 Woo
 Ah, B2k

 Just copped a Bentley and it's parked in my garage
 At 2: 00 appointment for my massage
 And everywhere we go they know just who we are
 There they go, it's them ghetto superstars

 The latest throwback and them ones on my feet
 Get out the Benz and then I'm off up in the jeep
 Take your friend with chicks that look like Alicia
 Keys
 All of that I'm still missin' one thing (Whoa)

 A girlfriend (Hey), girlfriend (Everything I wanted)
 I need a girlfriend (Yeah), girlfriend (And everything
 That I)
 Girlfriend (Oh), girlfriend (Would you be my)
 Would you be my girlfriend (Hey), girlfriend

 We hit the mall, I buy you Prada, Nike suits
 Ib apparel while I'm chillin' by the pool
 From the show to the limo, to the club
 Hand in the air, showin' nothin' but some love

 Got plenty clothes, plenty ice, plenty cash
 I'm pretty swoll, pretty abs, plenty (Shh...)
 I got every single thing that I need
 Except for a main squeeze (Whoa)

 I need a girlfriend (Oh, oh), girlfriend (Girlfriend)
 I need a girlfriend (Oh), girlfriend (I need, I need)
 {I need, I need}
 Girlfriend (A girlfriend), girlfriend (Would you be
 My)
 Would you be my girlfriend (Girlfriend), girlfriend
 (Yeah, yeah)

 Alright Alright
 We got B2k up in this peice
 (Tell me who's gonna be my girlfriend)
 And we need all the ladies out there lookin' for a nice fella to get up out yo seat c'mon!
 (And who I bet needs a real man)
 Put yall hand up Put yall hands up
 (And who's gonna ride or die with me)
 Yeah who's gonna be that ride or die chick for me tonight
 (Who's gonna give B2k what they need)

 I need a number one
 I need a thick with big hips, that's just my
 Motivation
 No more game preparation, this is pimparation
 She must be ready and steady for a romance session
 I'm talkin' willin to learn a Lil' Fizz lesson
 Now she plannin' it again and now where arguin'
 Talkin' girls, talk mess and tellin' all there friends
 But I seen this new chick tonight
 And I'mma make her my girlfriend, my girlfriend

 I need a girlfriend, girlfriend (Someone for me)
 I need a girlfriend (Yeah...), girlfriend (That is all
 I need, yeah)
 Girlfriend, girlfriend (In my life)
 Would you be my girlfriend (Oh), girlfriend (I need a)

 A girlfriend (Woo), girlfriend (Someone to call my
 Own)
 I need a girlfriend (Spend some money on), girlfriend
 (And I'm gonna take her out)
 A girlfriend (To show her what I'm all about),
 Girlfriend (Ey, hey, oh, ho...)
 Would you be my girlfriend, girlfriend (No, no, no,
 No)
