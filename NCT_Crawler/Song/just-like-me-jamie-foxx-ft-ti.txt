                        Say Foxx? (Yeah) I had I had a chick man (Yeah)
 She went and did me real wrong, I mean (Yeah)
 I did the same thing to her but she ain't have no right to do
 Me like that though dog, for real (Yeah) You, been seeing him, and I know
 And I was with her, and you knew about it
 But I was too blind to see it baby
 And you was out here doing the same thing as me
 I wanna ask, has he been by the crib?
 Has he been in our, car? And did you let him, drive?
 Cause she's been by the house, she's been in the car
 I've even let her push the Porsche around a couple times Oh, we were so the same
 I don't know why I can't see it baby
 And it ain't a point to feeling blue
 You're just like me and I'm just like you You're just like me
 Shorty all up in the club popping bottles of that Bud
 Giving all them dudes hugs and you just like me
 She don't know how to act on the floor backing it back
 Man I can't be mad she just like me,
 She just like me, she just like me, she just like me Now it ain't so easy for me to imagining what you been doing baby
 So I don't even have to ask (No)
 Cause you ain't the only one that keeping secrets baby
 So really, no sense in me playing back
 And I, can't stay up though 'cause I did you wrong
 And I was on some bullshit when I let that nigga bring her home
 She's out from us just like me and she played the game like one of my homies Oh, we were so the same
 I don't know why I can't see it baby
 And it ain't a point to feeling blue
 You're just like me and I'm just like you You're just like me
 Shorty all up in the club popping bottles of that Bud
 Giving all them dudes hugs and you just like me
 She don't know how to act on the floor backing it back
 Man I can't be mad she just like me,
 Gettin' money having fun man, she just like me,
 In the club throwin' ones she just like me,
 Twenty fours on the Range she just like me, go on shawty do ya thang Hey! Shawty who you fooling? You
 Know I'm way too cool for you
 To run that game when we play me
 Trying to do me like I be doing you
 Say you heard I was screwing her
 Just like I hear he doing you
 Why you worry about me doing me I see you doing you
 I can make her better though
 You goin' let him ruin you
 Just for the record know, I wouldn't have her
 Unless I could have the two of you
 I know why he pursuing you that booty do be moving boo
 Late night, straight pipe that ain't nothing new to you
 Wait a minute can't tell me wanna tell me something tell me this
 If I would of never would of hit that chick
 Would you even ever know that dude existed? No
 Got me twisted yo ass goodbye I've kissed it
 Now you all on his dick, shawty look at this dick You're just like me
 Shorty all up in the club popping bottles of that Bud
 Giving all them dudes hugs and you just like me
 She don't know how to act on the floor backing it back
 Man I can't be mad she just like me,
 She just like me, she just like me, she just like me
