                        That I haven’t seen your face
Try to be strong
But the stress I have is washing with
Wont belong before I get you by my side
And just hold you, tease you, squeeze you till
I was fill all my mind

I wanna make up right now now now
I wanna make up right now now now
Wish we never broke up right now now now
We need to lay up right now now now

I wanna make up right now now now
I wanna make up right now now now
Wish we never broke up right now now now
We need to lay up right now now now

Girl I know mistake will lay between us to
And we show our eyes that now even says somethings were true
I can’t go and haven’t seen my girl this thing
Why can it be the way it was
Your are my homie lover friend

I wanna make up right now now now
I wanna make up right now now now
Wish we never broke up right now now now
We need to lay up right now now now

I wanna make up right now now now

Wish we never broke up right now now now crime
