                        How does it feel to be on you own
 While the night slips away
 You toss and turn like a ship in the storm
 Have you lost your way I can see by the look in your eyes
 You've been hurt before
 Hold me close like the very first time
 Cause that's what love is for Theres no reason to cry cause Ill be there beside you
 When you need someone, I'd never leave you
 I swear that you will be the only one
 Through the sorrow and pain, just call out my name
 When you need someone, I'd sleep forever
 I swear that you would never be the only one
 When you need someone Sometimes the world can be so cold
 And you dont know why
 You're reaching out but theres no one to hold
 In times rushing by I can see by the look in your eyes
 You just can't let go
 Hold me close and together we'll find
 Just what love is for Theres no reason to cry cause Ill be there beside you
 When you need someone, I'd never leave you
 I swear that you would be the only one
 Through the sorrow and pain, just call out my name
 When you need someone, I'd sleep forever
 I swear that you would never be the lonely one
 When you need someone When you need someone, its a long, long day
 When you need someone, it's a crawl and change
 When you need someone, you can call out my name Theres no reason to cry cause I'll be there beside you
 When you need someone, I'd never leave you
 I swear that you would be the only one
 Through the sorrow and pain, just call out my name
 When you need someone, I'd sleep forever
 I swear that you would never be the lonely one
 When you need someone
