                        Bài hát: Serenade - Travis Scott

[Intro]
Red cups
My party hat on, you my party favor
Your trophy case filled with them accolades
When you leave, I just be hard as ***
Hard as ***, I'm tryna tell you somethin'

[Hook]
Before you go and have your parade
Before your sun turn black and grey
Come home, let me serenade ya
Serenade ya
Before you go and have your parade
Before your sun turn black and grey
Come home, let me serenade ya
Serenade ya
Before you go and have your parade
Before your sun turn black and grey
Come home, let me serenade ya
Serenade ya

[Hook 2]
Before you go and disobey
Before you let our love fade away
Let's go back to our younger days

[Verse]
You back to strippin, I'ma go back straight to tippin
My windows tinted they can't see me if I'm in it
Long distance I might use up all my minutes
My minutes, sippin on somethin prescription
So pop a livin, I'm just tryna feed the children
Feed all my sisters nigga, forget' all my bitches
And I, [?] in it
That girl all in it
That girl off Henny I ain't go unless you skinny
I need her thick, I can't do her if she skinny
I need her rich, I can't hand her that new henny
I need some niggas who be down when I ain't busy
Hard work, hard work and dedication
                        
                    |
