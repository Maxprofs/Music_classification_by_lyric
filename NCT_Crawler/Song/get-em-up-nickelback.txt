                        His driver's license said James he went by Jim
 A gangster wanna be and baby that was him
 He stole his uncle's 44 last Friday night
 Said if I wanted in we'd have to plan this thing just right
 We'll need the gloves, we'll need the bags a couple masks
 We'll need to steal a car with windows tinted black
 He picked the nearest bank on main and 17th
 We wrote down every line from every movie that we'd seen
 Screamin' This is a robbery now get down on the floor
 We're here for all the *** that you don't need no more (yeah)
 We want your cash open the safe get off the phone
 Don't be a hero and you might just make it home
 Get 'em up
 Then get down
 Reach for the sky
 Then go ahead and kiss the ground
 Get 'em up
 Then get down
 Reach for the sky
 Then go ahead and kiss the ground
 Get 'em up
 Get 'em get 'em up The fresh restored mustang small block 302
 Drove by the bank a dozen times this afternoon
 The only parking spot was half a bock away
 Gave us time to practice just exactly what to say
 Screamin' This is a robbery now get down on the floor
 We're here for all the *** that you don't need no more (yeah)
 We want your cash open the safe get off the phone
 Don't be a hero and you might just make it home
 Get 'em up
 Then get down
 Reach for the sky
 Then go ahead and kiss the ground
 Get 'em up
 Then get down
 Reach for the sky
 Then go ahead and kiss the ground
 Get 'em up
 Get 'em get 'em up
 Get 'em get 'em up The only thing I wish that one of us had known
 That it was Sunday and the god damn bank was closed
 Too bad we didn't see the cops across the street
 We dropped our guns and tried
 to run and there went all our dreams
 Screamin' This is a robbery now get down on the floor
 We're here for all the *** that you don't need no more (yeah)
 We wanted easy, straight and now we'll never know
 Somebody call my mom and tell her I ain't coming home
 Get 'em up
 Then get down
 Reach for the sky
 Then go ahead and kiss the ground
 Get 'em up
 Then get down
 Reach for the sky
 Then go ahead and kiss the ground
 Get 'em up
