                        Well, looks like I'm going again
 I can't seem to believe myself
 Here I go again, here I go again, here I go again
 Listen to me now It's five o'clock a.m.
 But the party is still going strong
 There's a conversation over in the corner
 Big Ed is all on the lawn And the FM music is groovin'
 Folks getting down, getting down in their stocking feet
 Sleepy eyes are peeping
 From the window across the street And it looks like daylight gonna catch me up again
 Gonna catch me up again
 Most people like getting up when I'm just getting in
 Oh, it's the only, only time
 It seems to be the only time that I can unwind Swore to myself
 Time and time and time again
 That I would give up the night life and start layin' in
 But it ain't easy, no no Sayin' no to my friends
 'Cause the real, 'cause the real
 Set don't get started
 Till everyone else is in And it looks like daylight gonna catch me up again
 Gonna catch me up again
 Most people like getting up when I'm just getting in
 It's the only, only, only, only time
 When I can unwind Daylight gonna catch me up
 Gonna catch me up
 Daylight gonna catch me up again Daylight gonna catch me up
 Gonna catch me up
 Daylight gonna catch me up again Daylight gonna catch me up
 Gonna catch me up
 Daylight gonna catch me up again
