                        Bài hát: The Greatest *** - Damien Rice

I made you laugh, I made you cry
I made you open up your eyes, didn't I?
I helped you open up your wings,
Your legs, and many other things, didn't I?

Am I the greatest *** that you know?
The only one who let you go?
Or the one you hurt so much you cannot bear?
We were good when we were good
When we were not misunderstood

You helped me love, you helped me live,
You helped me learn how to forgive, didn't you?
I wish that I could say the same,
But when you left, you left the blame, didn't you?

Am I the greatest *** that you met?
The only one you can't forget?
Am I the one your truth's been waiting for?
Or am I just dreaming once again?
Some dreams are better when they end...

Some make it, mistake it
Some force and some will fake it
I never meant to let you down...
Some ret it, forget it
Some ruin and some regret it
I never meant to let you down

We learned to wag and tuck our tails,
We learned to win and then to fail, didn't we?
We learned that lovers love to sing
And that losers love to cling, didn't we?

Am I the greatest *** that you know?
When will we learn to let this go?
We fought so much we've broken all the charm
But letting go is not the same as pushing someone else away

So please don't let on you don't know me,
Please don't let on I'm not here...
Please don't let on you don't love me, cause I know you do...
I know...

That some make it, mistake it
Some force and some will fake it
But I never meant to let you down...
Some fret it, forget it
Some ruin and some regret it
But I never meant to let you down
I never meant to let you
I never meant to let you down
I never meant...
