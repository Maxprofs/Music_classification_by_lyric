                        Round one, swear to God I do it for fun
 Just a dead man walking with a double barrel shotgun
 Ain't a single fucker left to fear
 See their lips moving but I don't wanna hear Showdown, I ain't backing down from anybody
 Throw down, if I don't get some space
 Lay down, not in this life or another
 Deny me, if it's not your way All I wanted was your honesty
 Something more than this, something more than me
 Death can take me if I can't be free
 I'm not like you, I'm a dying breed Round two, something you just don't wanna do
 You're dancing with the devil if you wearing my shoes
 You've got nerve and I'll give you that
 Watch the world crumble while you sit on your ass Wake up, get your head together motherfucker
 Straight up before it's too late
 Stand up, nothing ever lasts forever
 Don't cry and that's how it's gonna stay All I wanted was your honesty
 Something more than this, something more than me
 Death can take me if I can't be free
 I'm not like you, I'm a dying breed All I wanted was your honesty
 Something more than this, more than me
 Death can take me if I can't be free
 I'm not like you, I'm a dying breed
