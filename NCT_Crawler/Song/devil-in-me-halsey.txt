                        Bài hát: Devil In Me - Halsey

You said I
Would've hit the ceiling
You said I
You said I
Should eat my feelings
Head held high

I won't take anyone down if I cry tonight
But I still let everyone down when I change in size
And I went tumbling down trying to reach your high
But I scream too loud if I speak my mind

I don't wanna wake it up
I don't wanna wake it up
I don't wanna wake it up
The devil in me
I don't wanna wake it up
I don't wanna wake it up
I don't wanna wake it up
The devil in me

Gotta wake up, gotta wake up
Gotta wake up, gotta wake up
Gotta wake up, come back to life
Gotta wake up, gotta wake up
Gotta wake up, gotta wake up
Gotta wake up, come back to life

You said I'm
Too much to handle
You said I
Shine too bright
I burnt the candle
Flew too high

I won't take anyone down if I cry tonight
But I still let everyone down when I change in size
And I went tumbling down trying to reach your high
But I scream too loud when I speak my mind

I don't wanna wake it up
I don't wanna wake it up
I don't wanna wake it up
The devil in me
I don't wanna wake it up
I don't wanna wake it up
I don't wanna wake it up
The devil in me

Gotta wake up, gotta wake up
Gotta wake up, gotta wake up
Gotta wake up, come back to life
Gotta wake up, gotta wake up
Gotta wake up, gotta wake up
Gotta wake up, come back to life

Now I gotta wake it up
Now I gotta wake it up
Now I gotta wake it up
The devil in me
Now I gotta wake it up
Now I gotta wake it up
Now I gotta wake it up
The devil in me

Gotta wake up, gotta wake up
Gotta wake up, gotta wake up
Gotta wake up, come back to life
Gotta wake up, gotta wake up
Gotta wake up, gotta wake up
Gotta wake up, come back to life
