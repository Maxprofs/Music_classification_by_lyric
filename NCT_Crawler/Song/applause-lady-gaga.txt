                        Song: Applause - Lady Gaga

I stand here waiting for you to bang the gong
To crash the critic saying is it right, or is it wrong?
If only Fame had an IV baby could I bear
Being away from you, I found the vein put it in here
I live for the applause, applause, applause
I live for the applause-plause, live for the applause-plause
I live for the way that you cheer and scream for me
The applause, applause, applause
Give me the thing that I love
(I’ll turn the lights on)
Put your hands up make ‘em touch
(Make it real loud)
x2
A-P-P-L-A-U -S-E
Make it real loud
Put your hands up make ‘em touch
x2
I’ve overheard your theory
Nostalgia’s for geeks
I guess sir, if you say so
Some of us just like to read
One second I’m a Kunst then
Suddenly the Kunst is me
Pop culture was in ART now
Art’s in pop culture in me
I live for the applause, applause, applause
I live for the applause-plause, live for the applause-plause
I live for the way that you cheer and scream for me
The applause, applause, applause
Give me the thing that I love
(I’ll turn the lights on)
Put your hands up make ‘em touch
(Make it real loud)
x2
A-P-P-L-A-U -S-E
Make it real loud
Put your hands up make ‘em touch
x2
Touch, touch
Touch, touch now
Ooooooooh
I live for the applause, applause, applause
I live for the applause-plause, live for the applause-plause
I live for the way that you cheer and scream for me
The applause, applause, applause
Give me the thing that I love
(I’ll turn the lights on)
Put your hands up make ‘em touch
(Make it real loud)
