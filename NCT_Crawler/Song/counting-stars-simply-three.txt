                        Bài hát: Counting Stars - Simply Three

Lately, I've been, I've been losing sleep
Dreaming about the things that we could be
But baby, I've been, I've been praying hard,
Said, no more counting dollars
We'll be counting stars, yeah we'll be counting stars
sô
I see this life like a swinging vine
Swing my heart across the line
And my face is flashing signs
Seek it out and you shall find
Old, but I'm not that old
Young, but I'm not that bold
I don't think the world is sold
I'm just doing what we're told
I feel something so right doing the wrong thing
I feel something so wrong doing the right thing
I could lie, coudn't I, could lie
Everything that kills me makes me feel alive

Lately, I've been, I've been losing sleep
Dreaming about the things that we could be
But baby, I've been, I've been praying hard,
Said, no more counting dollars
We'll be counting stars (x2)

I feel the love and I feel it burn
Down this river, every turn
Hope is a four-letter word
Make that money, watch it burn
Old, but I'm not that old
Young, but I'm not that bold
I don't think the world is sold
I'm just doing what we're told
I feel something so wrong doing the right thing
I could lie, could lie, could lie
Everything that drowns me makes me wanna fly

Lately, I've been, I've been losing sleep
Dreaming about the things that we could be
But baby, I've been, I've been playing hard,
Sitting, no more counting dollars
We'll be counting stars (x2)

Take that money
Watch it burn
Sing in the river
The lessons are learnt (x4)
Everything that kills me makes feel alive

Lately, I've been, I've been losing sleep
Dreaming about the things that we could be
But baby, I've been, I've been playing hard,
Sitting, no more counting dollars
We'll be counting stars (x2)


Take that money
Watch it burn
Sing in the river
The lessons are learnt (x4)
