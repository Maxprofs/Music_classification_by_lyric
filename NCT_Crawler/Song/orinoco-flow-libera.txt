                        Orinoco Flow( contact: sonofgod_95)


Let me sail, let me sail, let the Orinoco flow
Let me reach, let me beach on the shores of Tripoli
Let me sail, let me sail, let me crash upon your shore
Let me reach, let me beach far beyond the yellow sea

Sail away 

From Bissau to Palau in the shade of Avalon
From Fiji to Tiree and the Isles of Ebony
From Peru to Cebu, feel the power of Babylon
From Bali to Cali far beneath the Coral Sea

Turn it up, turn it up, turn it up, up - Adieu

From the North to the South, Ebudae unto Khartoum
From the deep Sea of Clouds to the Island of the Moon
Carry me on the waves to the lands I've never been
Carry me on the waves to the lands I've never seen
                        
                    |
