                        You tried to hide yourself in a shell
 You wanted heaven but you got hell
 And then the darkness gained control over you
 When everything turned into bitter blue
 You went into the land of no return I cry over you
 Baby Blue
 I cry over you
 Baby Blue They never ever gave you a chance
 No dreams, no hopes, no helping hand
 Someone took all the colors out of your life
 That's when one night you left it all behind
 You went into the land of return I cry over you
 Baby Blue
 I cry over you
 Baby Blue I cry over you
 Baby Blue
 I cry over you
 Baby Blue I cry over you
 Baby Blue
 I cry over you
 Baby Blue
