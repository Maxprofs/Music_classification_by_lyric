                        Bài hát: Don't Fall In Love With A Dreamer - Kenny Rogers

Just look at you,sitting there.
Never looked better than tonight
And it'd be so easy to tell you i'd stay
Like i've done so many times
I was so sure this would be the night
You'd close the door and wanna stay with me
And i'd be so easy to tell you i'd stay
Like i've done so many times
Don't fall in love with a dreamer
Cause he'll always take you in
Just when you think you've really change him
He'll leave you again
Dont you fall in love with a dreamer
Cause he'll break you every time
Put out the light( just hold on)
Before you say goodbye
Now it's morning ( and the phone ring)
And you say you've gotta get your things together
You just gotta leave before you change your mind
And if you knew what i was thinking girl
I'd turned around id you'd just ask me one more time
Dont fall in love with a dreamer
Cause he'll always take you in
Just when you think you've really change him
He leave you again
Dont fall in love with a dreamer
Cause he'll break you every time
Put out the light ( just hold on )
Before we say goodbye
Before we say goodbye
