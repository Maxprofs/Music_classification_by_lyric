                        Bài hát: My Long Forgotten Cloistered Sleep - Kajiura Yuki

In my long forgotten cloistered sleep,
You and I were resting close in peace.
Was it just the dreaming of my heart?
Now I'm crying, don't know why.

Where do all the tears come from? (to my eyes)
Could no one ever dry up this spring?
If you find me crying in the dark,
Please call my name from the heart.

Sing with me a tiny autumn song,
with the melodies of the days gone by.
Dress my body all in flowers white,
So no mortal eye can see.

Where have all my memories gone? (and lost)
Should I roam again up yonder hill?
I can never rest my soul until
You call my name, you call my name from the heart.

(la la la...)

In my long forgotten cloistered sleep,
Someone kissed me whispering words of love.
Is it just a longing of my heart?
Such a moment of such peace.

Where do all the years come from? (to my eyes)
With no memories why should I cry?
I can never rest my soul until you call my name,
You call my name, you call my name.
Call my soul from the heart.
                        
                    |
