                        Bài hát: If I Lose Myself - OneRepublic, Alesso

I stared up at the sun
Thought of all of the people and places
And things I've loved

I stared up just to see
that all of the faces
you were the one next to me

You can feel the light start to tremble
Washing what you know out to sea
You can see your life out the window, tonight...

If I lose myself tonight
It'll be by your side
I lose myself tonight...
Woah, woah , woah

If I lose myself tonight
It'll be you and I...
Lose myself tonight

*Instrumental*

I woke up with the sun
Thought of all of the people, places and things I've loved
I woke up just to see
With all the faces
you were the one next to me

You can feel the light start to tremble
Washing what you know out to sea
You can see your life out the window, tonight...

If I lose myself tonight
It'll be by your side
I lose myself tonight...
Woah, woah, woah

If I lose myself tonight
It'll be you and I...
Lose myself tonight
Whooooooo...Whooo ,Awhooo

*Instrumental*

Take us down and we keep trying
40 000 feet keep flying...
Take us down and we keep trying
40 000 feet keep flying...

Take us down and we keep trying
40 000 feet keep flying...
Take us down and we keep trying
40 000 feet keep flying...

Lose myself
If I lose myself tonight..
Whoooooooooo
whoooooo,whooooooo
