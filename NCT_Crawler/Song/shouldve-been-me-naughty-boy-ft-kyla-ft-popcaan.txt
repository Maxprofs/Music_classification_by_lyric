                        Bài hát: Should've Been Me - Naughty Boy, Kyla, Popcaan

[Intro: Kyla + Popcaan]
I need you bad, I need you bad
I need you, I need you, I need you bad
I need you bad, I need you bad
I need you, I need you, I need you bad
It should've been you

[Verse 1: Kyla]
I needed a little space
Honest, I thought you'd stay waiting
I made my last mistake
You're happy and I hate it

[Pre-Chorus: Kyla + (Popcaan)]
And now I know that I spoke too soon
Seeing how fast you made moves
I want you so bad (Now I know)
I know you do, know you do, know you do...
I want you back but you're gone
All on my own I miss you
I know it's too late can't handle that truth
I want you so bad (Now I know)
I want you back but you're gone
I know you do, know you do, know you do...

[Chorus: Kyla + Popcaan]
It should've been me all along
It should've been you
It should've been me every time I closed my eyes
Yeah I can see, those times where I used to be
Well oh God, it should've been me all along
It should've been you

[Verse 2: Kyla]
Well how is that it seems
'Cause you don't think of me that often
How could I let you leave me?
Yeah, well it's too late now to stop ya

[Pre-Chorus: Kyla + (Popcaan)]
And now I know that I spoke too soon
Seeing how fast you made moves
I want you so bad (Now I know)
I know you do, know you do, know you do...
I want you back but you're gone
All on my own I miss you
I know it's too late can't handle that truth
I want you so bad (Now I know)
I want you back but you're gone
I know you do, know you do, know you do...

[Chorus: Kyla + Popcaan]
It should've been me all along
It should've been you
It should've been me every time I closed my eyes
Yeah I can see, those times where I used to be
Well oh God, it should've been me all along
It should've been you

[Refrain: Kyla]
It should've been, should've been me
It should've been me, should've been me all along
It should've been me all along
It should've been, should've been me
It should've been me, should've been me all along
It should've been me all along

[Verse 3: Popcaan]
Hey!

Werk hard and give yuh everyting boo
Mi take yuh to mi first ting too
Take ya, take ya like indo'

Mi guess that's a the ting though

Different man, yuh gon' swing to

Oh, shouldn't the day be for granted?
'Cause it should've been you all along
Now I know you feel like you're unwanted

Like you know you shouldn't leave all of 'em
Pretend like you're happy, you'll a grieve all of 'em
We were supposed to get married
The next girl I'll watch [?]

[Chorus: Kyla + Popcaan]
It should've been you
It should've been me all along
It should've been me every time I closed my eyes
Yeah I can see, those times where I used to be
Well oh God, it should've been me all along

[Post-Chorus: Kyla]
It should've been, should've been me
It should've been me, should've been me all along
It should've been me all along
It should've been, should've been me
It should've been me, should've been me all along
It should've been me all along
It should've been, should've been me
It should've been me, should've been me all along
It should've been me all along
