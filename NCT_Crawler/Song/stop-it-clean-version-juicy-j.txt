                        Bài hát: Stop It (Clean Version) - Juicy J

 Ima tell you broke n-ggas something
 Listen

 [Verse 1:]
 Make money, no vacation
 Pay cash don't make payments
 Getting high like I'm eighteen
 But I've been rich since the late eighties
 Backstage, naked ladies
 Poppin pills and swallowing babies
 Bad bitches ain't come to play
 She gon' give me head before I go on stage
 New car, a couple, a hundred
 Ain't nothin' I call it play money
 Bugatti, Ferrari, the Benz, the Bentley
 Juicy stay stuntin
 Street n-ggas, we packin them 2's
 Play with it, make action news
 Put some money on your head, you worth a stack or two
 Real n-gga I'm 100, I stay leanin, I chase money
 N-ggas out here savin hoes, n-ggas need to be savin money
 Made mine, can't take it from me
 Hit the club, I take your woman
 Take her home, get some head, wake up breakfast in bed
 Yeah n-gga that's grits and eggs
 Rich bitch don't forget the bread
 Up and down that interstate
 I move weight, that's Jenny Craig
 Ima f-ck me a model, ima f-ck me a model
 You only get to live one time, so ima f-ck me a model

 [Hook:]
 I make money all day then I ball with the profits
 N-ggas hate on me, I tell em hatin' n-ggas stop it
 Go f-ck with a bitch, get that becky then I'm gone
 Catch me on that loud pack, blowin on this strong (x2)

 [Interlude:]
 Straight out of north Memphis n-gga
 20 years in
 Still rich and ain’t gon stop getting rich
 Told you n-ggas I ain’t never gonna stop getting money
 Let’s get it

 [Verse 2:]
 Bitch you ain’t no killa
 And real n-ggas don’t talk
 Start *** in this club
 It’s going down in the parking lot
 N-ggas get killed and then we ain’t shedding no tears
 N-ggas can’t keep they mouth closed, judge give you them years
 Yo homie f-ckin yo bitch
 And she ain't acceptin' your calls
 Them n-ggas ain't holding you down
 And you call them n-ggas yo dogs
 They really out here hatin so stay strapped up like a tank
 They got guns they got in movies
 Except they not shootin' blanks
 Pass straight them, broad daylight
 They don’t care who lookin
 Young n-ggas got something to prove, n-ggas think he pushin
 Playin' round in my hood and I’ll smoke you like a swisha
 We don’t play bout money and we don’t play with them pistols

 [Hook:]
 I make money all day then I ball with the profits
 N-ggas hate on me, I tell em hatin' n-ggas stop it
 Go f-ck with a bitch, get that becky then I'm gone
 Catch me on that loud pack, blowin on this strong (x2)
