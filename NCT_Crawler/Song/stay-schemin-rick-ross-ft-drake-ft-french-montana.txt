I ride for my niggas dawg, I ride for my niggas
I slide for my niggas dawg, I ride for my niggas dawg

Stay schemin’
Niggas tryna get at me (dawg)
I ride for my niggas
Stay schemin’
Niggas tryna get at me (dawg)
I ride for my niggas

[Rick Ross - Verse 1]
Damn, life so short, * it, I dont wanna go to court
 * it, got a budget for the lawyer though
 * it, I’m on the run for the month
I’m in the bucket, paid 200 for it
My lil niggas thuggin’, even got me paranoid
I’m gettin money, thats in any nigga category
Double M I got G’s out in California

It bothers me when the guards get to acting like the broads
Guess every team doesn’t come complete with niggas like ours
Thats why I see no need to compete with niggas like y’all
I just ask them when you see me you speak up nigga thats all
Don’t be ducking like you never wanted nothing
Its feeling like rap changed, there was a time it was rugged
Back when if a nigga reached it was for the weapon
Nowadays niggas reach just to sell they record
Spaguetti bolognese and apollo lounge
Me and my G from DC thats how I roll around
Might look light, but we heavy though
You think Drake will pull some * like that you never know
Million dollar meetings in a polo lounge
Me and my man all Oliver North thats how I roll around
Shawty wanna tell me secrets ’bout a rap nigga
I tell a bitch its more attractive when you hold it down
Kobe ’bout to lose a hundred fifty M’s
Kobe my nigga I hate it, had to be him
Bitch you wasn’t with me shooting in the gym
(Bitch you wasn’t with me shooting in the gym)
Tell Lucien I said f-ck it I’m tearing holes in my budget
Bag her like we in public and take her ass out in public
Ordered it a filet tell her butterfly she’ll love it
She used to soda and nuggets she r
