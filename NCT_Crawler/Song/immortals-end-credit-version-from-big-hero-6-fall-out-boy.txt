                        Bài hát: Immortals (End Credit Version) (From Big Hero 6) - Fall Out Boy

They say we are what we are
But we don’t have to be
I’m glad to hate you but I do it in the best way
I’ll be the watcher of the eternal flame
I’ll be the guard dog of all your fever dreams

I am the sand, bottom half of the hourglass. (glass, glass)
I’ll try to picture me without you but I can’t
'Cause we could be immortals, immortals
Just not for long, for long

If we meet forever now, pull the blackout curtains down
Just not for long, for long
We could be immortals, immortals, immortals, immortals
Immortals

Sometimes the only payoff for having any faith
Is when it’s tested again and again everyday
I’m still comparing your past to my future
It might be over, but they’re not sutures

I am the sand, bottom half of the hourglass. (glass, glass)
I’ll try to picture me without you but I can’t
'Cause we could be immortals, immortals
Just not for long, for long

If we meet forever now, pull the blackout curtains down
Just not for long, for long
We could be immortals, immortals
Immortals

And if we meet forever now, pull the blackout curtains down
We could be immortals, immortals
Just not for long, for long
We could be immortals, immortals, immortals, immortals
                        
                    |
