                        Song: When The Lights Go Out (Radio Edit) - Five

Yeah, I like that, You know what I mean,
You're looking kinda fly tonight girl, What's up, Check it!

Baby when the lights go out, I'll show you what it's all about
Coming at you girl, You know you I like this girl, Here we go!

I ain't sorry for the way I feel,
I know you think I'm being insincere, 
From the way I'm treating you,
I never wanted to be so unkind, 
The only one thing on my mind, 
Is just kicking it with you girl!

Baby it's not the way I feel, you know you must believe me,
Baby it's not part of the deal, Oh, No, No!

[Chorus]
Baby when the lights go out, Every single word cannot express, 
The love and tenderness, I'll show you what it's all about,
Babe I swear you will succumb to me, So baby come to me, 
When the lights go out!

I know you think it may be just a lie,
Ain't no use in putting up a fight,
Cos my heart is set on you, 
I see the truth its in your eyes, 
I ain't fooled by your thin disguise,
I can see I'm getting through babe!

Girl don't deny the way you feel, You know you've gotta trust me, 
Give a chance to prove I'm real, Oh, Yeah, Yeah!

[Chorus]
Baby when the lights go out, Every single word cannot express, 
The love and tenderness, I'll show you what it's all about,
Babe I swear you will succumb to me, So baby come to me, 
When the lights go out! Every single word cannot express, 
The love and tenderness, I'll show you what it's all about,
Babe I swear you will succumb to me, So baby come to me, 
When the lights go out!

When I flick da switch, Make ya hips wanna dip now,
I can get you off, Cos I'm ready and equipped now, 
Swing for me baby give me all that you got, 
Never wanna stop cos ya make me feel hot,
I know what you wanna do, And that I feel the same way too, 
Give me what ya want through, The days and the nights, 
Yeah its about time, That we turned out the lights!
                        
                    |
