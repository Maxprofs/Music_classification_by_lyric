Thank God I found you

I will give up everything,
before I'd seperate
myself from you.
After so much suffering,
I finally found
unvarnished truth.
I was all by myself for the longest time,
so cold inside.
 And I heard from my heart
it would not subside,
I felt mine dying.
 Untill you saved my life....
Thank God I found you,
I was lost without you.
My every wish and every dream,
some how became reality.
You brought the sunlight
complete in my whole life.
I'm overwhelmed with gratitude,
cause baby
 I'm so thankful I found you...
I will give you everything,
there's nothing in this world
I wouldn't do.
To insure your happiness,
I cherrish every part of you.
 Cause without you
beside me I can't survive,
 I don't wanna try.
 If you're keep'in me warm each
and every night,
I'll be alright.
Cause I need you in my life....
Thank God I found you,
I was lost without you.
My every wish and every dream,
some how became reality.
You brought the sunlight,
complete in my whole life.
 I'm overwhelmed with gratitude,
cause baby
 I'm so thankful I found you...
See, I was so destitude
before you came to me.
 Looking back,
I guess it shows that we were destined.
To shine after the rain,
to appreciate,
 be careful what we have.
And I'll go threw it all over again,
To be able to feel this way...
Thank God I found you,
I was lost without you.
My every wish and every dream,
some how became reality.
You brought the sunlight,
complete in my whole life.
I'm overwhelmed with gratitude,
to my baby
I'm so thankful I found you..
you...
