                        Bài hát: Sober - Bazzi

I don't smoke cigarettes
But I know you like to
So I face an entire pack
Just to be there with you

And I never fall for girls
But you got me tripping
Running your hand through my curls
All my worries missin'

Don't know if it's the Hennessy
That's got you in your honesty
Oh, I just hope you still mean what you say
When the sun comes up

Oh, I hope it's not the alcohol
That makes me think I want it all
Oh, I just hope I still mean what I say
When the night is up

Will I want you when I'm sober? Sober, sober
Will I want you when it's over? Over, over
Will you want me when you're sober? Sober, sober
Will you want me when it's over? Over, over, yeah

Late night up in the hills
Wish this would last forever
Thinking I want this real
Feelings can't be misjudged

Don't know if it's the Hennessy
That's got you in your honesty
Oh, I just hope you still mean what you say
When the sun comes up

Oh, I hope it's not the alcohol
That makes me think I want it all
Oh, I just hope I still mean what I say
When the night is up

Will I want you when I'm sober? Sober, sober
Will I want you when it's over? Over, over
Will you want me when you're sober? Sober, sober
Will you want me when it's over? Over, over, yeah

Morning comes
Will you still want me to stay?
To stay, to stay

Will I want you when I'm sober? Sober, sober
Will I want you when it's over? Over, over
Will you want me when you're sober? Sober, sober
Will you want me when it's over? Over, over, yeah

Sober
