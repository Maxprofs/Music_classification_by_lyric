[Verse 1: Adam Levine]
Say say say, hey hey now baby
Oh my my, don't play now baby
Say say say, hey hey now baby
So let's get one thing straight now baby
Tell me tell me if you love me or not, love me or not, love me or not
I bet the house on you, am I lucky or not, lucky or not, lucky or not?
You gotta tell me if you love me or not, love me or not, love me or not
Been wishin' for you, am I lucky or not, lucky or not, lucky or not?

[Hook: Adam Levine]

[Chorus: Adam Levine]
Tell me, tell me if you love me or not, love me or not, love me or not
I bet the house on you, am I lucky or not, lucky or not, lucky or not?
You gotta tell me if you love me or not, love me or not, love me or not
Been wishin' for you am I lucky or not, lucky or not, lucky or not?

[Bridge: Adam Levine & SZA]
Are we too grown for games?
Are we too grown to play around?
Young enough to chase
But old enough to know better
Are we too grown for changin'?
Are we too grown to mess around?
Oh and I can't wait forever baby
Both of us should know better

{Hook: Adam Levine & SZA]
Ooooh, oooh
Been wishin' for you
Ooh, ooh
Try to do what lovers do (ooh)
Ooooh, oooh
Been wishin' for you
Ooh, ooh
Try to do what lovers do (ooh)
Ooooh, oooh
Been wishin' for you
Ooh, ooh
Try to do what lovers do (ooh)
Ooooh, oooh
Been wishin' for you
Ooh, ooh
Try to do what lovers do (ooh)
