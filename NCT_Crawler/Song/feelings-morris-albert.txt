                        Feelings, nothing more than feelings,
Trying to forget my... feelings of love.
Tear drops... rolling down on my face,
Trying to forget my... feelings of love.

 Feelings, for all my life I'll feel it.
 I wish I've never met you, girl ... You'll never come again.

 Feelings... wo-o-o, feelings,
 wo-o-o, feelIngs... again in my arms.

Feelings, feelings like I've never lost you
And feelings like I've never have you... again in my heart.

 Feelings, for all my life I'll feel it.
 I wish I've never met you, girl... you'll never come again.

Feelings, feelings like I've never lost you
And feelings like I've never have you... again in my life.

 Feelings... wo-o-o, feelings,
 wo-o-o, feelings... again in my arms.
 Feelings...wo-o-o,feelings ......
