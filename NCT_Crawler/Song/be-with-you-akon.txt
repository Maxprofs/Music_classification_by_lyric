Be With You

eh eh eh eh eh
eh eh eh eh eh
ohhhhhh...

I know they wanna come and separate us but they can't do us nothin
Your the one I want and I’m a continue lovin
Cause your considered wify and I’m considered husband
And I’m a always be there for you
And either way you look at it I ain’t goin no where for my muffin
Cause she gonna hold it down, cant no body tell her nothin
You got the kind of love that always make a fussin
And that’s what gets me closer to you

And no one knows
Why I’m into you
Cause you'll never know what its like to walk in our shoes
And no one know, the things we've been through
Can never measure up to half of what I put you through
That’s why we'll break through

And I don’t care what they say
I’m gonna be with you
I’m gonna be with you
I wanna be with you
And I don’t care what they do
I’m gonna be with you
I’m gonna be with you
I’m gonna be with you

Seems like every day that go by things are gettin harder
Want to be the one that give you the whole enchilada
Cause I know what my baby like, I lean you on that Prada
You ain’t got to match with the shoes
All about knowing you I’m into doing things to keep her longer
Stickin together forever, watch you grow stronger
That’s the way it has to be, everything problem
Keepin it always true

And no one knows
What I’m into you
Cause you'll never know what its like to walk in our shoes
And no one know, the things we've been through
Can never measure up to half of what I put you through
That’s why we'll break through

And I don’t care what they say
I’m gonna be with you
I’m gonna be with you
I wanna be with you
And I don’t care what they do
I’m gonna be with you
I’m gonna be with you
I’m gonna be with you

You are everything in my life see the joy you bring
And ain’t no one I compare you to
And I know that you will never walk away from me no matter what
And that’s why I plan to do the same thing for you
And I want you to know

And I don’t care what they say
I’m gonna be with you
I’m gonna be with you
I wanna be with you
And I don’t care what they do
I’m gonna be with you
I’m gonna be with you
I’m gonna be with you

And I don’t care what they say
I’m gonna be with you
I’m gonna be with you
I wanna be with you
And I don’t care what they do
I’m gonna be with you
I’m gonna be with you
I’m gonna be with you
