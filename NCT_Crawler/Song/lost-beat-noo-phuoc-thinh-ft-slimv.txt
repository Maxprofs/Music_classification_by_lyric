                        Bài hát: Lost - Noo Phước Thịnh, DJ SlimV

Everything is lost
Everything is gone
Even all the pictures of you
No more slamming door
No more shatter glass
No more shouting at each other

Tell me what's right
Tell me what's wrong
Tell me how you want me to move on
I don't know why I don't know how
Now you're just someone I don't know
Out of my life, out of my sight
And don't you come and question me
Now that you're gone
Now that I'm strong
It's time to change and set me free

Tears on your face
No more hopes or faith
Empty words filled with disgrace
Chains on the floor
What are you waiting for
Scars are too deep to re-heal

Tell me what's right
Tell me what's wrong
Tell me how you want me to move on
I don't know why I don't know how
Now you're just someone I don't know
Out of my life, out of my sight
And don't you come and question me
Now that you're gone
Now that I'm strong
It's time to change and set me free
                        
                    |
