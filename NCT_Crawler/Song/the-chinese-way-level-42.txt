                        Take a journey back in time
 Leave the western world behind
 Cross the mountains to Peking
 Where the paper lanterns gently swing The Chinese way
 Who knows what they know?
 The Chinese legend grows
 The Chinese way
 Who knows what they know?
 The Chinese legend grows My eyes wide open
 I feel a breeze
 Words softly spoken
 In Cantonese Standing at the master's side
 There with patience he confides
 Secret knowledge, sacred ways
 Pearls of wisdom from the dragon days I could never lie
 For honor I would die
 Following the Chinese way
 So many years ago hero's ruled the world
 (Some died for love)
 They were the only ones in a cruel world
 (In a cruel world) I could never lie
 For honor I would die
 Following the Chinese way From the mountains to Peking
 Where the paper lanterns gently swing The Chinese way
 Who knows what they know?
 The Chinese legend grows
 The Chinese way
 Who knows what they know?
 The Chinese legend grows The Chinese way
 Who knows what they know?
 The Chinese legend grows
 The Chinese way
 Who knows what they know?
