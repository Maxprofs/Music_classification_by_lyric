                        Bài hát: Your Love - Rihanna

City lights don't shine as bright when we're apart.
Baby you have got the key to my heart.
Promise that you never leave me in the dark.
And if I need your light be my star.

[Chorus]:
---- You say you love me, love me, love me.
 But that don't do nothing for me.
 You've gotta do more than tell me what you're felling.
 Cause if you want me, want me, want me
 I better become your only
 That's the only way that i'll be waiting.

 Cause I would just die without it, and there aint know doubt about it
 Your love, your love, your love~~veve
 Cause I would never make it without it, and there aint know doubt it
 Your love, your love, your love~ve~veve. ----

Like a flame that flickers in come on light my fire
Love me like there is no end till the end of time
[Chorus]:
 .........
 Cause I would just die without it, and there aint know doubt about it
 Your love, your love, your love~~veve
 Cause I would never make it without it, and there aint know doubt it
 Your love, your love, your love~ve~veve.
