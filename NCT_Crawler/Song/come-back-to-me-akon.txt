                        [Verse 1:]
Going crazy
Heart is breaking
I, can't, sleep at all
Tryna get through this
Dont know how
I'll do this
I, know
That I only
Got myself to blame
(Only got myself to blame)
But that doesn't help
To ease the pain
(Doesn't help to ease the pain)
I'll just die
If I cant see her face

[Chorus:]
Until ya come back
I cant breath
Until ya come back
I got no reason
Got my heart
My heart down
On it's feet
I still need you
Beside me

[Verse 2:]
Now it's morning
Your still gone and
I, still
Reach for you
(Still reach for you)
Don't know how to
Live with out you
I, wish
I can take back
All da hurt I cause
If I can take back
All the love I lost
My pain is just took
Higher because yeah

[Chorus]

Pleaseeee
Forgive me
Let me have
One more chance
In your life
Till your with me
I'll be
Half alive
Until ya come back

[Chorus]

Cause I need you
Beside me
