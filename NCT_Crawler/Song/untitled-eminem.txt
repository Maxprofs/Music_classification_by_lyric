Girl I think you just might of tried to pull a mother***in' fast one, when I'm mad
you just hurt my god damn feeling, and that was the last one I had
Does this look like an arcade, tryina play games, see the saw blade?
see the silhouette, of a stalker, in your walk way, better cooperate,
or get saute and rotisserie while you're hogtied?
MC's get so quiet you can hear a muh***in' dog whistle when I walk by
???
I don't gas my mercedes after midnight, I treat it like I ??
cause it will turn into a grimlin and run over kids when ??
VRIN VRIN, motor so big you could fit a midget in the engine
bitch gimme them digits while you cringing
Not by the hair of my chiny chin chin
will I spend spend, even ten cents on you, since when
do you think it's gonna cost me a pretty penny, SHIIT
If I think a penny's pretty
Just imagine how beautiful a quarter is to me
Ini mini miny moe, catch an Eskimo by his toe
while he's trying to roll a snowball
but, don't make him lose his cool, if he hollers let him GO YALL!

Yep, baby get a move on like a uhual,
you could rack your brain like pool balls
you would never think of this ***, yeah honey you called?
well here I come, havoc on the beat, I reak it
Evil I see here and speak it
lady put your money on shady *** that other weak ***
put your eggs in the same basket
you could count every muh***ing chicken before it hatches
cause' you could bet your ass that,
we gon get it crackin
Like the crack in of the titans when they clashing
get your brains bashing so bad you gonna have kurt kobain askin' to autograph a bloodstained napkin
unfashionable, about as rational as a rational fag's ***
Now lets take that line, run it up the flag pole with elton
see if he's cool with it
don't stand there and look stupid at me, bitch, I'm aint in the mood for this ***
get my dick, GOOGLE IT, till it pops up
double some mother***ing foolish *** you could stock up
me, I'm always ***ting diarrhea of the mouth till the speakers *** out

Girl you got a hot butt, like a lit cigarette
-chick cigarette- cause you gon get a hott butt from me some day
so do not strut my way slut because

And now that I got your panties in a bunch, and your bowels in an uproar
I'mma show you why I came so you can stop asking what the *** for
Now look you little slut, ***, ***, know you want more
bitch is time to put the mat back in the mathers cause I'm a ***in' (problem) Run boy
Every flow, got it mastered, so every last word that you ***ing fags heard
comes straight from the bitches ass, yeah, in other words I'm a bas-turd
looking at me like I killed Kenny, gas in the tank, yeah still plenty
no morals are instilled in me, so remorse I really don't feel any
eat your heart out, Hannibal, understandable, why you jealous
*** an animal, I got cannibal ??? and ??? now can you hoe
(shady I don't understand your flow), understand my flow?
bitch I flow like troy polomanu's hair boy, don't you dare try to follow or compare boy,
I'm raw, you aint even medium rare, stay the *** outta my hair boy
You can look, you can stare, point, but you can't touch, I'm too ? boy
I don't get it man, is there a void, all this weak ***, what am I steroids?
my vision backwards, I'm *** for that ass and your trunk, elephant ??
and remember boys!
