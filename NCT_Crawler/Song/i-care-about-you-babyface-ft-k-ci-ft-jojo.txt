                        Sometimes I feel so alone, baby
 I call your heart but there's no one at home
 And takin' a toll on my pride, pride
 I'm reachin' out but there's no one inside You know it doesn't feel right when I look in your eyes
 I know love is blind but the heart doesn't lie
 I'll ask one more time, maybe, this time you'll try
 So tell me, girl, what's deep in your heart Girl, I care about you, I'm there for you
 So why don't you care for me like I care about you
 Girl, I care a'bout you, I'm there for you
 So why don't you care for me like I care about you I spend like all of my days, baby
 Tryin' to cess out just how things got this way
 I thought that we were in love
 But I swear right now, I don't know what you want, babe I'll make sure that I give you quality time
 But lately I feel you're not home by design
 But still I'm gonna try to give you the love of my life
 In hopes that you, that you would open the door, delay Girl, I care about you, I'm there for you
 Why don't you care for me like I care about you
 Girl, I care about you, I'm there for you
 So why don't you care for me like I care about you Sometimes I'm not sure that, that I'm all you've got
 Sometimes I'm not sure you love me or not, baby
 There's one that I'm certain of, girl, I care for you
 And the one thing that I want is that you care for me too, yeah Girl, I care about you, I'm there for you
 So why don't you care for me like I care about you
 Girl, I care about you, I'm there for you
 So, so why don't you care for me like I care about you Oh baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
 Oh yeah, I care for you, baby, baby, baby
