                        I've travelled the whole wide world
Still I haven't found you
Call out your name almost every day
Hope to hear from you soon
Still believe that you will come to me
And I'll be waiting right here
I keep on looking for you patiently (patiently)
Fighting out all doubts and fears

Bridge:
Just a vision of you is enough for the prove
And I'm willing to do what it takes
I am ready for pain and the joy that you bring
Holding on even if my heart breakes

Chorus:
Love, love don't come easy
For the one who wants to be loved
Love, love don't come easy
Seems there is none but I won't give up
Love don't come easy
Feelings grow slowly, slowly
Love is taking its time
Love don't come easy
Don't wanna be lonely, lonely
One day you will be mine, you will be mine (you will be mine)

I lived so many lives
I've touched a millions of hearts
I spread my wings but I couldn't fly
Though I wished on so many stars
No,no,no,no
Painted different pictures in my mind
But I can't build a frame
And what ́s the use of painting if I seem to be blind
Please show me your face

Bridge:
Just a vision of you is enough for the prove
and I'm willing to do what it takes
I am ready for pain and the joy that you bring
holding on even if my heart breakes

Chorus:
Love, love don't come easy
For the one who wants to be loved (to be loved)
Love, love don't come easy
Seems there is none but I won't give up
Love don't come easy
Feelings grow slowly, slowly
Love is taking its time
Love don't come easy
Don't wanna be lonely, lonely
One day you will be mine, you will be mine

What did I do?
Did I scare you away?
What can I do to make you stay?
Why can't you see I'm on my knees?
I need you here with me, oohh!

Chorus:
Love, love don't come easy
for the one that wants to be loved
Love, love don't come easy
Seems there is none but I won't give up
Love don't come easy
feelings grow slowly, slowly
love is taking it's time
love dont come easy
don't wanna be lonely, lonely
one day you will be mine,you will be mine
