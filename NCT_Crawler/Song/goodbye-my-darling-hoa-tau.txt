                        Bài hát: Goodbye my darling - Hòa Tấu

And I swear,
It was perfect
Now we're racing with time again
I'll bet, that I'm more then you've ever wanted

 I swear to god, I swear
That it's all you ever want
Take my hand and guide the way
Thats what you said to me
I won't, I won't be there
With open arms, It's far too late

 Just take this broken heart for right now
Just promise to get up or get out
Just take this broken heart for right now

 And I swear, it was perfect
Now we're racing with time again
I'll bet, that I'm more then you've ever wanted
(x2)

 Now, stay still while I say,
Goodbye my darling
Oh no you can't, you won't
I'd rather be alone
Time has passed us by
I guess that this is how I do
Now why do you, 
Why do you have to do this to me

 There I was with open arms
with open arms cralwing out
                        
                    |
