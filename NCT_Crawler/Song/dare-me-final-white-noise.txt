                        Bài hát: Dare Me Final - White Noise

I won’t stop cause today I’m gonna be whatever I wanna be
I was born to be the only one, the very only one
And I’m dare to be myself, to different from all of you
I know that you wanna kill me, but you’ll never have the chance *
Do I have to be, do I have to be someone I don’t know **
Do you think that it’s really boring, to see your face sinking in the crowd
That’s the reason why you never like me, you never wanna see my face ***
So common and let your life fading away, slipping away
I’m flying over the stare, follow the blood, never give up being me
I go to school today with this ring hanging out loosely on my nose
I know that I’m just little unsual but I’m not ugly
And it’s called to be the only one, the very special one
I know that you wanna kill me but you’ll never have the chance
*Do I have to care, do I have to know the bullshit you spit out **
Do you think that it’s really boring, to see your face sinking in the crowd
That’s the reason why you never like me, you never wanna see my face ***
So common and let your life fading away, slipping away
I’m flying over the stare, follow the blood, never give up being me
(You will never have the chance to kill me )* 4times ***
Common and let your life fading away, slipping away
I’m flying over the stare, follow the blood, never give up being me ***
So common and let your life fading away, slipping away
I’m flying over the stare, follow the blood, never give up being me
