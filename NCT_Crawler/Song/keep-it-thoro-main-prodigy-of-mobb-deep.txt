                        [sinister laughter]

 Oh y'all niggas killers now, oh word?
 Catch you comin out your ***in crib nigga
 Yeah, catch a ***in bullet nigga

 [Prodigy]
 Ayo, I break bread, ribs, hundred dollar bills
 Peel on the Ducatis and other four wheels
 Write a book full of medicine and generate mills
 Tour the album, only for more sales
 We used to catch those on the block with crills
 Now it's paid shows, promoters post up bills
 Sign deals only if the math is real
 If you can't match numbers then you can't have the Head Nigga In Charge
 Of ***, live nigga rhymes artist
 Pardon, P dub shines regardless
 Remorseless, haunt niggas like poltergeists
 My advice, 'fore you get like that, is think twice
 'fore you move on it, put jewels on it, who want it
 Loose niggas make the news when we start formin'
 Snatch stripes off a nigga's uniform often
 Doin it past yo' delf you way out your jurisdiction
 Why niggas bull*** on the grill
 I don't *** around dunny, this move's real
 I Keep It Thoro nigga

 Yo let me back up for 'em, lemme back up, yo, yo
 Why niggas bull*** on the grill
 I don't *** around dunny, this move's real
 I gave birth to your whole style and feel
 How do it feel, to hold my dick in public
 Cock blower, duplicate rap cloner
 It's me and you do it live on stage for dolo
 I smack niggas like you, smash niggas by the tools
 Grab niggas by the throat, show 'n' prove
 Rhymes cocky, crazy ill, mad rowdy
 Did a buck off of my *** and wrapped your outtie
 Tempermental, I snap quick, very touchy
 Ayo my attitude is all ***ed up and real ***ty
 I rap like no one out there can *** wit me
 You feel different, niggas see me
 I throw a TV at you crazy, bitches say P you crazy
 A +Pain in Da Ass+, nah but +*** you, Pay me+
 I'm no shorty, nigga I stop your glory
 I'm a thorough street nigga for real, you just applaud me
 Avoid P, man take your baby mom's advice
 I'm nothing sweet, I'll with the guns, you pay the price
 When you see me in the streets soldier, salute me
 You just a groupie, oh you gangsta, then shoot me
 Who gives a *** really, I miss my nigga Twin, kill me
 So I can join the rest of my falls, up in the heavens
 You rap niggas make me laugh, y'all crazy ass
 And I don't give a *** what you sold, that *** is trash
 Bang this, 'cause I gurantee that you bought it
 Heavy airplay all day wit no chorus
 I Keep It Thoro nigga...
