                        Telling the truth, telling me lies,
I can't handle it, you gotta decide.
Give me a hug, give me a kiss,
there's no way back one time you started like this.


Take me away, take me away,
we leave this planet, no more need to stay.
Take me away, don't wait for the day,
so in the night light we will shine and play (x2)

Let yourself go, and enjoy the bass fly

Here comes the bass!

Take me awa -a -a -a -ay (x4)

When you touch my skin, a beautiful sin,
this magic eyes, I can only give in.
Now this is the truth, just me and you,
there're so many things that I wanna do (x2)

Take me awa -a -a -a -ay (x4)

Take me away, take me away,
we leave this planet, no more need to stay.
Take me away, don't wait for the day,
so in the night light we will shine and play

Take me awa -a -a -a -ay (x8)
                        
                    |
