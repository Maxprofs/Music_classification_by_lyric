                        Night Nurse x2

Its critical,
'Cause your body's gonna rock like a chemical,
Makes you bouncing around the block just like an outlaw,
We're gonna take it too the top, 12 O'Clock (That's it)
G-g-guess whos on night shift?,

'Cause tonight I'm working over time
Oh are you ready to cross the line
I'll treat you until the break of dawn,
You're not alone.

Night Nurse-urse x3
Who you gonna call?

Don't wanna be your lover - oh no
But I could be your remedy - oh oh
Don't wanna be your lover - oh no
But I could be your remedy - your cure
Night Nurse.

Its physical
Cuz tonight were gonna party on the top floor
Elevate you there
And I dont care if it all comes natural,
Your medical prescription - baby get ready now
This is my religion.

'Cause tonight I'm working over time
Oh are you ready to cross the line
I'll treat you until the break of dawn,
You're not alone.
