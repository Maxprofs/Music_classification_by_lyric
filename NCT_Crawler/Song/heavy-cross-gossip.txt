                        It's a cruel, cruel world to face on your own
 A heavy cross to carry along
 The lights are on but everyone's gone
 And it's cruel It's a funny way to make ends meet
 When the lights are out on every street
 It feels alright but never complete
 Without joy I checked you
 If it's already been done, undo it
 It takes two
 It's up to me and you to prove it On the rainy nights, even the coldest days
 You're moments ago but seconds away
 The principal of nature, it's true but
 It's a cruel world We can play it safe or play it cool
 Follow the leader or make up all the rules
 Whatever you want, the choice is yours
 So choose I checked you
 If it's already been done, undo it
 It takes two
 It's up to me and you to prove it I trust you
 It's already been done, undo it
 It takes two
 It's up to me and you to prove it I checked you
 If it's already been done, undo it
 It takes two
 It's up to me and you to prove it I trust you
