                        Bài hát: Love Don't Hate - David Archuleta

[Verse 1]
Don't know what I was thinking
I messed up and now we're sinking
Said things I didn't mean
Hard to watch your heart breaking

[Chorus]
Words cut like razor blades and left you
with a scar
Made a mistake I can't erase
Oh I was wrong
Took you for granted
And I can't stand it
Shouldn't be that way
'Cause love don't hate, hate
Love don't hate, hate

[Verse 2]
You said that you need time
'Cause hurt don't heal over night
It's not enough to apologize
What I did wrong I need to make right

[Repeat Chorus]

[Bridge]
I should've listened
I should've met you in the middle like
I needed to
Nobody's perfect
No fight is worth the risk if it's gonna
mean losing you

I should've listened
I should've listened

[Repeat Chorus]
                        
                    |
