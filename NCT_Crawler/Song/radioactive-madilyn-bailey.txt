                        I'm waking up to ash and dust 
I wipe my brow and I sweat my rust 
I'm breathing in the chemicals ooh 

I'm breaking in, I'm shaping up 
And checking out on the prison bus 
This is it, the apocalypse whoa 

Chorus: 

I'm waking up, I feel it in my bones 
Enough to make my systems blow 
Welcome to the new age, to the new age 
Welcome to the new age, to the new age 
Whoa, whoa, I'm radioactive, radioactive 
Whoa, whoa, I'm radioactive, radioactive 

I raise my flags, I don my clothes 
It's a revolution, I suppose 
We'll paint it red to fit right in whoa 

I'm breaking in, I'm shaping up 
And checking out on the prison bus 
This is it, the apocalypse whoa 

Chorus: 

I'm waking up, I feel it in my bones 
Enough to make my systems blow 
Welcome to the new age, to the new age 
Welcome to the new age, to the new age 
Whoa, whoa, I'm radioactive, radioactive 
Whoa, whoa, I'm radioactive, radioactive 

All systems go, sun hasn't died 
Deep in my bones, straight from inside 

Chorus: 

I'm waking up, I feel it in my bones 
Enough to make my systems blow 
Welcome to the new age, to the new age 
Welcome to the new age, to the new age 
Whoa, whoa, I'm radioactive, radioactive 
Whoa, whoa, I'm radioactive, radioactive
