                        Bài hát : A Whole New World - Megan Lee

I can show you the world.
SHinning, shimmering, splendid.
Tell me, princess ! Now when did you last let your heart decide ?

I can open your eyes
take you wonders by wonders
over, sideways and unders
on a magic carpet ride


A whole new world
A new fantastic point of view
No one to tell us know or where to go, Or say we're only dreaming

A whole new world
A dazzling place i never knew
But when i'm way up here, it's crystal clear 
That's now I'm in a whole new world with you
( Now i'm in a whole new world with you )


Unbelievable sights
Indescribable feelings 
Soaring, tumbling, free wheeling 
Through an endless diamond sky

A whole new world
Don't you dare close your eyes 
A hundred thousand things to see
( hold your breath, it gets better )


I'm like a shooting star
I've come so far
I can't go back
To where I used to be

A whole new world
Every turn a surprise
With new horizons to pursue
Every moment red-letter

I'll chase them anywhere
There's time to spare
Let me share this whole new world with you

A whole new world
That's where we'll be
A thrilling chase
A wondrous place
For you and me
                        
                    |
