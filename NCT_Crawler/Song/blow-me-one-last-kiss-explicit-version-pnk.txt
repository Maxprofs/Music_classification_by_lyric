                        White knuckles and sweaty palms from hanging on too tight
Clenched shut jaw, I've got another headache again tonight
Eyes on fire, eyes on fire, and they burn from all the tears
I've been crying, I've been crying, I've been dying over you
Tie a knot in the rope, tryna hold, tryna hold,
But there's nothing to grab so I let go

I think I've finally had enough, I think I maybe think too much
I think this might be it for us (blow me one last kiss)
You think I'm just too serious, I think you're full of *
My head is spinning so (blow me one last kiss)

Just when it can't get worse, I've had a * day (NO!)
Have you had a * day? (NO!), we've had a * day (NO!)
I think that life's too short for this, I want back my ignorance and bliss
I think I've had enough of this, blow me one last kiss.

I won't miss all of the fighting that we always did,
Take it in, I mean what I say when I say there is nothing left
No more sick, whiskey dick, no more battles for me
You'll be calling a trick, 'cause you'll no longer sleep
I'll dress nice, I'll look good, I'll go dancing alone
I will laugh, I'll get drunk, I'll take somebody home

I think I've finally had enough, I think I maybe think too much
I think this might be it for us (blow me one last kiss)
You think I'm just too serious, I think you're full of *
My head is spinning so (blow me one last kiss)

Just when it can't get worse, I've had a * day (No!)
Have you had a * day? (No!), we've had a * day (No!)
I think that life's too short for this, I want back my ignorance and bliss
I think I've had enough of this, blow me one last kiss.

Blow me one last kiss
Blow me one last kiss

I will do what I please, anything that I want
I will breathe, I will breathe, I won't worry at all
You will pay for your sins, you'll be sorry my dear
All the lies, all the why's, will all be crystal clear

I think I've finally had enough, I think I maybe think too much
I think this might be it for us (blow me one last kiss)
You think I'm just too serious, I think you're full of *
My head is spinning so (blow me one last kiss)

Just when it can't get worse, I've had a * day (No!)
Have you had a * day? (No!), we've had a * day (No!)
I think that life's too short for this, I want back my ignorance and bliss
I think I've had enough of this, blow me one last kiss.

Blow me one last kiss
Blow me one last kiss

Just when it can't get worse, I've had a * day (No!)
Have you had a * day? (No!), we've had a * day (No!)
I think that life's too short for this, Want back my ignorance and bliss
I think I've had enough of this, blow me one last kiss.
