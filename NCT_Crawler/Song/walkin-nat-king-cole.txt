                        I'm walkin' out the door with you on my mind
 I'm walkin' out the door with you on my mind
 But every step away from you, I feel like cryin' I walked into the street, talkin' to myself
 I walked into the street, talkin' to myself
 No matter what my conscience says, I'm thinkin' 'bout nobody else I met a brand new chick, phone to make a date
 I met a brand new chick, phone to make a date
 But when her I rang her number up but I got your number by mistake You say you love me, baby, don't know what to do
 You say you love me, baby, don't know what to do
 I'm sure of one thing, I'm in love with you
