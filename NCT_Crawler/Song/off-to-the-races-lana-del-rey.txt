                        Title: Off To The Races
Artist: Lana Del Rey

My old man is a bad man
But I can't deny the way
He holds my hand 
And he grabs me
He has me by my heart
He doesn't mind
I have a Las Vegas past
He doesn't mind
I have a L.A. crass way about me
He loves me
With every beat of his cocaine heart
Swimming pool
Glimmering, darling
White bikini off
With my red nail polish
Watch me in the swimming pool
Bright blue ripples, you sitting
Sipping on your black Cristal, yeah
Light of my life
Fire of my loins
Be a good baby
Do what I want
Light of my life
Fire of my loins
Give me them gold coins
Give me them coins
And I'm off to the races
Cases of Bacardi chasers 
Chasing me all over town
'Cause he knows I'm wasted 
Facing time again on Riker's Island
And I won't get out
Because I'm crazy, baby
I need you to come here and save me 
I'm your little scarlet, starlet
Singing in the garden
Kiss me on my open mouth
Ready for you

My old man is a tough man, but
He got a soul
As sweet as blood red jam
And he shows me
He knows me
Every inch of my tar black soul 
He doesn't mind
I have a flat, broke-down life 
In fact he says he thinks
It's what he might like about me
Admires me
The way I roll like a rolling stone
He likes to watch me
In the glass room
Bathroom, Chateau Marmont
Slipping on my red dress
Putting on my makeup 
Glass room, perfume
Cognac, lilac fumes 
Says it feels like heaven to him 
Light of his life
Fire of his loins
Keep me forever
Tell me you own me
Light of your life
Fire of your loins
Tell me you own me
Give me them coins
And I'm off to the races
Cases of Bacardi chasers 
Chasing me all over town
'Cause he knows I'm wasted 
Facing time again on Riker's Island
And I won't get out
Because I'm crazy, baby
I need you to come here and save me 
I'm your little scarlet, starlet
Singing in the garden
Kiss me on my open mouth
Yo I'm off to the races, laces
Leather on my waist is tight
And I am falling down 
I can see your face is shameless
Cipriani's basement
Love you but I'm going down
God I'm so crazy, baby
I'm sorry that I'm misbehaving 
I'm your little harlot, starlet
Queen of Coney Island 
Raising hell all over town 
Sorry 'bout it

My old man is a thief and
I'm gonna stay and pray with him
'Till the end
But I trust in the decision of the Lord
To watch over us
Take him when he may
If he may
I'm not afraid to say
That I'd die without him 
Who else is going to put up with me
This way? 
I need you
I breathe you
I'd never leave you 
They would rue the day
I was alone without you
You're lying with your gold chain on 
Cigar hanging from your lips 
I said, "Hon'
You never looked so beautiful
As you do now, my man"
And we're off to the races, places 
Ready, set, the gate is down
And now we're going in 
To Las Vegas, chaos
Casino Oasis
Honey, it is time to spin 
Boy, you're so crazy, baby 
I love you forever
Not maybe 
You are my one true love
You are my one true love

You are my one true love
