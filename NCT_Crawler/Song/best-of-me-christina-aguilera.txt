Artist: Best Of Me
Albums: Lotus (Deluxe Edition)

Think I'm steel
Tough as nails
Never feel
Never fail
But you're wrong

So damn wrong
Feel the weight
Of your hate
I still bleed
My heart aches
As you take

And You take

Words cut through my skin
Tears roll down my chin
My walls crumble within

But I'll take it all on
And get up when I fell
Till the last curtain call

But you'll never get the best of me
No more
Said you'll never get the best of me
No more
Arn't you tired of throwing stones
Trying to kick me when I'm down
But you'll never get the best of me no more

So you're cold
Made of ice
Heart of stone
Born to fight
But I cry

I still cry
Are you happy
You know
I'm unhappy
You know
Take your shot
I'm wide open

Words cut through my skin
Tears roll down my chin
My walls crumble within

But I'll take it all on
And get up when I fell
Till the last curtain call

But you'll never get the best of me
No more
Said you'll never get the best of me
No more
Arn't you tired of throwing stones
Trying to kick me when I'm down
But you'll never get the best of me no more

But you'll never get the best of me
No more
Said you'll never get the best of me
No more
Arn't you tired of throwing stones
Trying to kick me when I'm down
But you'll never get the best of me no more

Heartbroken an beaten
Knocked down and mistreated
I will rise undefeated
I will not let you bring me down
Now the pain is deleted
And I will never repeat it
I will rise and defeat it
I will not let you bring me down

No I won't let you bring me down

Knocked down and mistreated
Heartbroken and bleeding
Still I rise undefeated
Cause you'll never

Cause you'll never get the best of me
No more
Said you'll never get the best of me
No more
Arn't you tired of throwing stones
Trying to kick me when I'm down
But you'll never get the best of me no more

Heartbroken and bleeding
Knocked down and mistreated
Still I rise undefeated
I will not let you bring me down
Now the pain is deleted
And I will never repeat it
I will rise and defeat it
I will not let you bring me down
