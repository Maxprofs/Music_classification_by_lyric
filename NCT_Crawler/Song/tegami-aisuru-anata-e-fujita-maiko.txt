                        Romaji:
Otou-san oka-san
Kyou made watashi o
Taisetsu ni sodatete kurete
Arigatou

Otou-san ARUBAMU o mekuru to
Mada chiisana watashi
Anata ga daite ite

Ima dewa shiroi kami to shiwa ga
Sukoshi fueta anata
Nandaka setsunakute

Shinpai kaketari shikararetari
Iron'na koto ga atta ne
Taihen na omoi bakari sasete gomen ne
Itsumademo genki de ite ne

Otou-san oka-san
Kyou made watashi o
Taisetsu ni sodatete kurete
Arigatou
Otou-san oka-san
Aisuru anata e
Kono hanataba o okurimasu
Daisuki da yo

Oka-san anshin suru koe de
'Okaeri' tte nando mo
Mukaete kureta darou

Anata ga atatakai sono te de
Tsukuru gohan nando
Issho ni tabeta darou

Watashi ga umareta hi no nikki ni wa
Anata no yasashii moji de
'Sunao de kawaii ko de sodatte ne' to
Sonna watashi ni ima narete imasu ka?

Otou-san oka-san
Aisareta koto wa
Itsumo ato kara kidzukimasu
Arigatou
Otou-san oka-san
Aisuru anata e
Watashi wa nani ga dekiru darou
Daisuki da yo

Unde kurete arigatou
Negatte kurete arigatou
Shikatte kurete arigatou
Shinjite kurete arigatou
Aishite kurete arigatou
Zutto zutto watashi no taisetsu na hito

Otou-san oka-san
Kyou made watashi o
Taisetsu ni sodatete kurete
Arigatou
Otou-san oka-san
Aisuru anata e
Kono hanataba o okurimasu
Daisuki da yo

Aisareta koto wa
Itsumo ato kara kidzukimasu
Arigatou
Otou-san oka-san
Futari no kodomo ni
Umare shiawase o shitta yo
Arigatou

English:
Mom, dad
Thank you
For carefully nurturing me
Until this day

Dad When I flip through the album
You were embracing
The still small me before

You who had a little more
White hair and wrinkles
Was somehow sad

Making you worry Getting scolded
There were a lot of things that happened
I'm sorry for causing many terrible memories
Forever be always in good spirits

Mom, dad
Thank you
For carefully nurturing me
Until this day
Mom, dad
To you whom I love
I send this bouquet
I love you very much

Mom How many times have you
Welcomed me saying 'Welcome back'
In a relaxed voice

How many times have we eaten together
The meals that you made
With those warm hands

In the diary of the day I was born
With your gentle letters you wrote
'Please grow up to be a cute and obedient child'
Have I now become like that?

Mom, dad
I always notice later
That I am being loved
Thank you
Mom, dad
To you whom I love
What will I be able to do
I love you very much

Thank you for giving birth to me
Thank you for praying for me
Thank you for scolding me
Thank you for believing in me
Thank you for loving me
You'll forever and ever be my important people

Mom, dad
Thank you
For carefully nurturing me
Until this day
Mom, dad
To you whom I love
I send this bouquet
I love you very much

I always notice later
That I am being loved
Thank you
Mom, dad
Born being the child of both of you
I knew happiness
Thank you
