Jonas Brothers - Inseparable

Take my hand tonight
We can run so far
We could change the world
Do anything we want
We could stop for hours
Just staring at the stars
They shine down to show us...

You know when the sun forgets to shine
I'll be there to hold you through the night
We'll be running so fast we could fly tonight
And even when we're miles and miles apart
You're still holding all of my heart
I promise it will never be dark
I know we're inseparable

We could run forever
If you wanted to
I would not get tired
Because I'd be with you
I'd keep singing this song
Until the very end
We'd have done all these things

You know when the sun forgets to shine
I'll be there to hold you through the night
We'll be running so fast we could fly tonight
And even when we're miles and miles apart
You're still holding all of my heart
I promise it will never be dark
I know we're inseparable

I will give it all
Never let you fall
Cause you know we're inseparable
I would give it up
Just to show you I'm in love
Cause you know we're inseparable

You know when the sun forgets to shine
I'll be there to hold you through the night
We'll be running so fast we could fly tonight
And even when we're miles and miles apart
You're still holding all of my heart
I promise it will never be dark
I know we're inseparable
                        
                    |
