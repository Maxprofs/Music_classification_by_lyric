                        Bài hát: Hurt Lovers - Blue

When the words that you wanted to say
Are all coming out wrong,
When you burst into tears,
Though you're trying so hard to be strong,
Ohhh
We're standing in,
Allowed to fight,
Trying to make two wrongs right,


Hurt Lovers, Hurt, Hurt Lovers oh,
Don't give up, Don't, Don't give up no,
Think of it
You can't just let it go,
You gotta try,
You gotta try,


So when all that you ever believe
Comes apart at the seams,
And when all of the bridges you build
Are washed away in a stream,


Ooooh,
Whatever comes,
It's not the end,
We gotta fight,
And take a stand

Hurt Lovers, Hurt, Hurt Lovers oh,
Don't give up, Don't, Don't give up no,
Think of it
You can't just let it go,
You gotta try,
You gotta try,

Hurt Lovers, hurt so bad again
Find something, to make things right again
It don't matter who wins out in the end
You gotta try,
You gotta try,
Even when you lose hope
And you made your last words?,
You know,
You know, you know

We're standing in,
Allowed to fight,
Trying to make two wrongs right,



Hurt Lovers, Hurt, Hurt Lovers oh,
Don't give up, Don't, Don't give up no,
Think of it
You can't just let it go,
You gotta try,
You gotta try,
Hurt Lovers, hurt so bad again
Find something, to make things right again
It don't matter who wins out in the end

You gotta try,
You gotta try,
                        
                    |
