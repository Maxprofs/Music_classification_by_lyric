                        Bài hát: We Find Love - Daniel Caesar

You don't love me anymore
Let's see how you like this song
I see you walking out that door
Wonder why it took you so long
Ever since the day that I met you

I knew you were the girl of my dreams
But we could never be
You don't love me anymore
Lets see how you like this song
We find love, we get up

And we fall down, we give up
We find love, we get up
And we fall down, we give up
You don't love me anymore
Lets see how you like this song

You need someone you adore
Find a place where you might belong
Ever since the day that I met you
My world's been spinning out of control
I just need you to hold
We knew we'd come around

This thing called love comes crashing down now
Pieces all on the ground
What once was lost cannot be found out
We knew we'd come around
This thing called love comes crashing down now
Pieces all on the ground

What once was lost cannot be found out
We knew we'd come around
This thing called love comes crashing down now
Pieces all on the ground
What once was lost cannot be found out

Heaven help us, heaven help us, yeah
We're on our own
We find love, we get up
And we fall down, we give up
We find love, we get up

And we fall down, we give up
We find love, we get up
And we fall down, we give up
We find love, yeah, we get up
We fall down, we give up
                        
                    |
