                        Bài hát: Transparent - The-Dream, Rihanna

As much as I try to say I don't love you 
Everything I say says I do 
As much as I try not to show you that love
The more than those parts seek right through 
Is it that clear 
Everywhere I go 
I wear you on my sleeve 
Everyone knows 
Everyone sees 
I wear your heart 
Right on my face
And your unbreakable love bends for me just when I need a break 

And I'm as scared as ever love forever 
They said I'll never have that 
Me without me
Me without you
Spare me the dramatics 
Never lasting, ever lasting 
Everything but magic 
I've had it all lost but here I am loving you 

As much as I try to say I don't love you 
Everything I say says I do 
As much as I try not to show you that love 
The more than those parts seek right through 
Is it that clear 
I wear your heart right on my face 
your unbreakable love bends for me just when I need a break 

And I'm as scared as ever love forever 
They said I'll never have that 
Me without me 
Me without you 
Spare me the dramatics 
Never lasting, everlasting 
Everything but magic 
I've had it all lost but here I am loving you 

As much as I try to say I don't love you 
Everything I say says I do 
As much as I try not to show you that love 
The more than those parts seek right through 
Is it that clear 
Seems you see straight through me 
Is it that transparent apparently 
That you're the only one I'll ever need 
Is it that clear
                        
                    |
