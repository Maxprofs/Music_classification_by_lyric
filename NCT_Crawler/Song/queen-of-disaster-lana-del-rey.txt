                        What you do to me is indescribable
Got me sparkling just like an emerald
Send my soul on fire and make me wild like the deep blue sea

No other boy ever made me feel beautiful
When I’m in your arms, feels like I have it all
Is it your tattoos or golden grill that makes me feel this way?

Ya got me spinning like a ballerina, feeling gangsta every time I see ya
You’re the king and baby I’m the queen of disaster, disaster
Got me spinning like a ballerina, you’re the bad boy that I always dreamed of
You’re the king and baby, I’m the queen of disaster, disaster

My mascara thick, I think I’ll get emotional
You know I was more than just a party girl...
Isn’t hard to see what’s going on, I’m so far gone

When I saw your face it was incredible
Pin it on my soul it was indelible
Let’s celebrate our twisted fate, we’re the broken ones

Got me spinning like a ballerina, feeling gangsta every time I see ya
You’re the king and baby, I’m the queen of disaster, disaster
Got me spinning like a ballerina, you’re the bad boy that I always dreamed of
You’re the king and baby, I’m the queen of disaster, disaster

Ladies and gentlemen, for the very first time....

You got me spinning like a ballerina, feeling gangsta every time I see ya
You’re the king and baby, I’m the queen of disaster, disaster
Got me spinning like a ballerina, you’re the bad boy that I always dreamed of
You’re the king and I’m the beauty queen of disaster, disaster
