                        I can see how you are beautiful
 Can you feel my eyes on you
 I'm shy and turn my head away Working late in diner Citylite
 I see that you get home alright
 Make sure that you can't see me
 Hoping you will see me Sometimes I'm wondering
 Why you look me and you blink your eye
 You can't be acting like my Dana?
 (Can you?) I see you in Citylite diner
 Serving all those meals and then
 I see reflection of me in your eye
 Oh, please Talk to me, show some pity
 You touch me in many, many ways
 But I'm shy can't you see Obsessed by you, your looks
 Well, anyway, "I would any day die for you"
 I write on paper and erased away Still I sit in diner Citylite
 Drinking coffee and reading lies
 Turn my head and I can see you
 Could that really be you? Sometimes I'm wondering
 Why you look me and you blink your eye
 You can't be acting like my Dana? I see your beautiful smile
 And I would like to run away from
 Reflections of me in your eyes
 Oh, please Talk to me, show some pity
 You touch me in many, many ways
 But I'm shy, can't you see I see, can't have you, can't leave you there
 'Cause I must sometimes see you
 But I don't understand how you can keep me in chains And every waken hour
 I feel you taking power from me and I can't leave
 Repeating the scenery over again Sometimes I'm wondering
 Why you look me and you blink your eye
 You can't be acting like my Dana? I see your beautiful smile
 And I would like to run away from
 Reflections of me in your eyes
 Oh, please Talk to me, show some pity
 You touch me in many, many ways
 But I'm shy, can't you see, oh, baby Talk to me, show some pity
 You touch me in many, many ways
 But I'm shy, can't you, I'm shy, can't you
 I'm shy, can't you see
