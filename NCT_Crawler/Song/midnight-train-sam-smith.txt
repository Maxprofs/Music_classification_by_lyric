                        Bài hát: Midnight Train - Sam Smith

I choose me
And I know that's selfish, love
You are a dream
And I can't thank you enough
But I give another piece of me away
Every waking day that I'm with you

Am I a monster?
What will your family think of me?
They brought me in
They helped me out with everything
But I give a little piece of me away
Every single day

So I pick up the pieces
I get on the midnight train
I got my reasons
But darling I can't explain
I'll always love you
But tonight's the night I choose to walk away

Love you so much
That I have to let you go
I'll miss your touch
And the secrets we both know
But it would be wrong for me to stay
And I'll just give you hope

So I pick up the pieces
I get on the midnight train
I got my reasons
But darling I can't explain
I'll always love you
But tonight's the night I choose to walk away

I can't stop crying
I hate that I've caused you pain
But I can't deny it
I just don't feel the same
I'll always love you
But tonight's the night I choose to walk away

So I pick up the pieces
I get on the midnight train
I got my reasons
But darling I can't explain
I'll always love you
But tonight's the night I choose to walk away
                        
                    |
