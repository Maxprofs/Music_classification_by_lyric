                        Every morning when I wake up, uh, money on my mind
 Good times and get caked up, uh, sunshine coming through my blinds
 I'm living but, really though, it's never enough
 10 milli on, that's a must, living in California
 Everybody wanna visit for (Women, weed and weather)
 They come for (Women, weed and weather)
 (For the women, weed and weather)
 From all around the world for the (Women, weed and weather)
 These niggas'll kill for that, put it in your grill for that
 Still everybody gotta build for that, me? I make mills off that
 How the *** can't y'all see I ride, when I drive, down the block and
 You look outside, H-A-T-E in your eyes, I enter big money for the enterprise
 It's a beautiful day I guess for a bitch to roll with Andre I guess
 Roll it up, baby come lift that dress then roll it up for me when I'm stressed You might catch me in Atlanta looking like a boss
 New Orleans and then Miami, party in New York
 Texas I be screwed up, Chi town I be really pimping
 But nothing like my hometown I'm forever living
 Women, weed and weather
 (They come for) women, weed and weather
 For the women, weed and weather
 (From all around the world for the) women, weed and weather
 Got that women, weed and weather
 Don't it sound clever, come and play
 What more can I say? Welcome to LA My nigga said he wanna fly out to get him
 Some, three W's only for a three day run, bitch
 Take them mother***in' panties off, you ain't no nun, ***
 I be living in the sky every time I ride by them hoes
 Ribbon in the sky on the radio cause Stevie know I control
 Let it breathe, I control, California living 'til I am old
 You want to be one, to peak on the chart
 So the peons can be gone and pee on their hearts
 She in the coupe, she in the Neon cause she on the BS before we can start
 *** with a nigga, ride with a nigga, let 'em know the priority order me
 Hennessy and for my niggas OG Killa, call it Jason Voorhees
 Boy he's on his job, boy he sure be having the marks on they mark
 Pretty bitches and tire marks, let 'em inhale them pipe exhausts
 Let 'em reveal how much it cost for this life controlling my vice
 No way hell no, uh uh, if I'm wrong I don't wanna be right
 You want to be one, to peak on the chart
 So the peons can be gone and pee on their hearts
 Women, weed, weather, it's not my fault
 That it's 82 degrees and my top peeled off You might catch me in Atlanta looking like a boss
 New Orleans and then Miami, party in New York
 Texas I be screwed up, Chi town I be really pimping
 But nothing like my hometown I'm forever living
 Women, weed and weather
 (They come for) women, weed and weather
 For the women, weed and weather
 (From all around the world for the) women, weed and weather
 Got that women, weed and weather
 Don't it sound clever, come and play
 What more can I say? Welcome to LA Known for that homegrown where I come from
 Smoke one, palm trees, double D's got 'em topless in the sun
 I shall proceed, that's me, mutha*** your opinion
 How many ways am I killing 'em? ***, right around a billion
 We on it, that mean we living for the moment
 That mean she'll *** 'til the morning, time and I got time
 And I know that I'm in a position of controlling, anything by that ocean
 I'm a boss I'll buy that ocean, ain't nobody ***ing with this They want that ***, they often feind, I give it to 'em, but in between
 My time, I gotta tie shoestrings, life's a trip when you want these things
 I often slip and then I lean toward three W's in life
 You know blow job need an application, eating pussy make appetite
 And yeah my type, I like 'em brown, just like my drink, the *** you think
 I don't *** with no hand me downs, see if you *** then it's after me
 You know how much I'mma make it work? You know her dress, slip it in her purse
 When you discussed your love for lust, just make sure you visit here first, Cali You might catch me in Atlanta looking like a boss
 New Orleans and then Miami, party in New York
 Texas I be screwed up, Chi town I be really pimping
 But nothing like my hometown I'm forever living
