                        Bài hát: Thích Em - G.E.M (Đặng Tử Kỳ)

The fine rain brings the wind to the wet streets of the evening
Brushing off the water from my eyes, I suddenly look up without reason
Gazing towards the lonely night light, there are my hurtful memories

Once again, I brought up the countless yearning in my heart
The past smile/laughter is still hung on my face
I wish you would know at this moment
My sincere words

###Chorus###
I love you, your touching eyes
Your laughter that is even more mesmerizing
I wish I can once again caress your adorable face
And talk about our dreams as we hold hands
Just like yesterday, you and me

I, who is full of ambitions, was once too impulsive
I always complained that it was hard to find freedom in a relationship with her
I wish you would know at this moment
My sincere words

#Repeat Chorus

Every night I wander off alone; it’s so cold
In the past, I only struggled for myself
I never thought about her pain before

#Repeat Chorus
                        
                    |
