                        Bài hát: My Love (Acoustic) - Westlife

An empty street,
An empty house,
A hole inside my heart,
I'm all alone and the rooms are getting smaller

I wonder how,
I wonder why,
I wonder where they are,
The days we've had,
The songs we've sang together(oh yeah).

And oh my love,
I'm holding on forever,
Reaching for a love that seems so far,

Chorus:
So i say a little prayer,
and hope my dreams will take me there,
where the skies are blue to see you once again,
My love,
overseas from coast to coast,
to find the place I love the most,
where the fields are green to see you once again,
my love.

I try to read,
I go to work,
I'm laughing with my friends,
but I can't stop to keep myself from thinking

I wonder how
I wonder why
I wonder where they are
the days we had, the songs we sang together

And oh my love
I'm holding on forever
reaching for the love that seems so far

Chorus:
So i say a little prayer,
and hope my dreams will take me there,
where the skies are blue to see you once again,
My love,
overseas from coast to coast,
to find the place I love the most,
where the fields are green to see you once again...

To hold you in my arms,
To promise you my love,
To tell you from the star
you what I'm thinking of

Reaching for the love that seems so far

Chorus:
(So)So i say a little prayer,
and hope my dreams will take me there,
where the skies are blue to see you once again,
My love,
overseas from coast to coast
to find the place I love the most,
where the fields are green to see you once again (Oh Yeah)
So i say a little prayer, (say a little prayer)
and hope my dreams will take me there (take me there)
where the skies are blue (oh yeah) to see you once again
my love (oh my love)
                        
                    |
