Ohhh ohhh
Yeah, yeah

I don't believe in much
But I believe in you
I don't believe I can't
'Cause I don't follow rules, hey
I see your star so bright, 
No one can dim that light
No one can cross you out, but you

And I, I, I
Living on borrowed time
And I, I, I 
I'mma be gettin' mine and
And I, I, I
I'll be wrong if I don't try
Don't know when my next meals coming
All I know is I'll be running

I, I, I
I be livin' it up, I be livin' it up, yeah
I, I, I
I be throwin' it up, I be throwin' it up, yeah
I, I, I'll
I'll be playing it cool
'Cause a girl's gotta do, what a girl's gotta do
Making up my own rules

O'la, o'la aye, 
O'la, o'la aye,
O'la, o'la aye, 
O'la, o'la aye

I have my doubts in love, but I know it's true
I don't have many friends, but I got you
You are a walking gun
You are a secret bomb
Something no one can take from you
Ohh, I

And I, I, I
Living on borrowed time
And I, I, I 
I'm gon' be getting mine and
And I, I, I
I'll be wrong if I don't try
I don't know when my next meals coming
All I know is I'll be runnin'

I, I, I
I be livin' it up, I be livin' it up, yeah
I, I, I
I be throwin' it up, I be throwin' it up, yeah
I, I, I'll
I'll be playing it cool
'Cause a girl's gotta do, what a girl's gotta do
Making up my own rules

I'mma live life to the fullest
I'll be speeding like a bullet
I'll be rolling like a train
I'll be dancing in the rain

I, I, I
I be livin' it up, I be livin' it up, yeah
I, I, I
I be throwin' it up, I be throwin' it up, yeah
I, I, I'll
I'll be playing it cool
'Cause a girl's gotta do, what a girl's gotta do
Making up my own rules

O'la, o'la aye, 
O'la, o'la aye,
O'la, o'la aye, 
O'la, o'la aye
