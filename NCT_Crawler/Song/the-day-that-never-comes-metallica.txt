Rock|

                        Born to push you around
You better just stay down
You pull away
He hits the flesh
You hit the ground

Mouth so full of lies
Tend to black your eyes
Just keep them close
Keep praying
Just keep waiting

Waiting for the one
The day that never comes
When you stand up and feel the warmth
But the sunshine never comes, no...
The sunshine never comes

Push you across that line
Just stay down this time
Hide in yourself
Crawl in yourself
You'll have your time

God, I'll make 'em pay
Take it back one day
I'll end this day
I'll splatter color on this grey

Waiting for the one
The day that never comes
When you stand up and feel the warmth
But the sunshine never comes, no...
The sunshine never comes

Love is a four letter word
And never spoken here
Love is a four letter word
Here in this prison

I suffer this no longer
I'll put an end to this I swear!
This I swear!
The sun will shine
This I swear!
This I swear!
This I swear!
                        
                    |
