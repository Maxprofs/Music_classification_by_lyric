                        Bài hát : It Girl - Jason Chen, Megan Nicole

[Megan]
I've been looking under rocks and breaking licks
Just tryna find ya
I've been like a manic insomniac
5 steps behind you
Tell them other boys, they can hit the exit
Check please...
Cause I finally found the boy of... my dreams
Much more than a Grammy award
That's how much you mean to me

[Jason]
You could be my it girl
You're my greatest gift, girl
Lovin' you could be a crime
Crazy how we fit girl
This is it girl
Give me 25 to life
I just wanna rock all night long
And put you in the middle of my spotlight
You could be my it girl
You're my biggest hit girl

Let me play it loud
Let me play it loud like... oh oh oh oh
Let me play it loud
Let me play it loud like... oh oh oh oh
Let me play it loud

[Jason]
You can't help but turn them heads
Knockin' them dead
Dropping like flies around you
If I get your body close, not letting go
Hoping you're about to
Tell them other guys they can lose your number
You're done!
They don't get another shot cause you're... love drunk
Like a TV show playing reruns
Every chance I get
I'mma a turn you on

[Megan]
You could be my it boy
Baby you're the greatest gift, boy
Lovin' you could be a crime
Crazy how we fit boy
This is it
Give me 25 to life
I just wanna rock all night long
And put you in the middle of my spotlight
You could be my it boy
You're my biggest hit boy

[Both]
Let me play it loud
Let me play it loud like... oh oh oh oh
Let me play it loud
Let me play it loud like... oh oh oh oh
Let me play it loud

[Megan]
Can't seem to stop you from... running, running
Through my, through my mind, mind
Just keep it coming, coming
Til I make you mine, mine

[Jason]
You've got that something, something
I wanna be with girl (I wanna be with boy)
You're my greatest hit girl (You're my greatest hit boy)
Just say this is it girl...
Hey baby...
Don't you know you're my it girl

[Both]
You could be my it boy
You're the greatest gift
Lovin' you could be a crime
Crazy how we fit girl
This is it
cause you're my it girl
I just wanna rock all night long (all night long)
And put you in the middle of my spotlight
You could be my it boy (You could be my it girl)
You're my biggest hit girl

Let me play it loud
Let me play it loud like... oh oh oh oh
Let me play it loud
Let me play it loud like... oh oh oh oh
Let me play it loud
