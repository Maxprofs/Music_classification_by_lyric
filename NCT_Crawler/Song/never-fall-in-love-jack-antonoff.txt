                        Bài hát: Never Fall In Love - Jack Antonoff

I met you in the park you were drinking in the dark
With your clique and we clicked uh huh
Oh it all felt so right I got hooked I don't know why
But I knew yes I knew it wouldn't fly
You wouldn't believe
You would have to see it
My heart is so blind
And baby so sure
You took chances
Now we doing it my way
And it caused just such pain
Now I want to explain
I will never, ever, ever, ever fall in love
I was lying when I told you that I love you
Don't give me your emotions
I was lying when I told you that I need you
Don't give me your devotion 
I will never fall in love (no)
Never fall in love (no)
Never fall in love with you
I was lying when I told you that I love you
Don't give me your emotions
Now when we meet you don't even want to greet me you just be like be like bitch you so off beat
Well you should know I've been down that road and oh that's why I that's why I stay on my own
You wouldn't believe
You would have to see it
My heart is so blind
And baby so sure
You took chances
Now we doing it my way
And it caused just such pain
Now I want to explain
I will never, ever, ever, ever fall in love
I was lying when I told you that I love you
Don't give me your emotions
I was lying when I told you that I need you
Don't give me your devotion
I will never fall in love (no)
Never fall in love (no)
Never fall in love with you
I was lying when I told you that I love you
Don't give me your emotions
Oh look to be the cherry tree
I'm a fool I'm a fool I'm a fool and I love it
I just wanna be dangerous and free
I'm a fool I'm a fool don't you waste your time on me
'Cause I was lying when I told you that I love you
Don't give me your emotions
I was lying when I told you that I need you
Don't give me your devotion
I will never fall in love (no)
Never fall in love (no)
Never fall in love with you
I was lying when I told you that I love you
Don't give me your emotions
