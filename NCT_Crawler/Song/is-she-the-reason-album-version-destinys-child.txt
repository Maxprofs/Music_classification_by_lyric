                        Verse 1 Beyonce
 I thought that this was something (yes)
 Promising that one day
 It would turn into something (yes)
 I thought the feelings were mutual
 And I didn't have to guess
 Started being skeptical
 Always unavailable
 Like you didn't know
 But now I'm feeling something (yes)
 It's telling me this may not be the real something (yes)
 But you was showing me
 Now I'm ready and you running
 Damn you got me open now
 Feeling like I'm choking now
 Where am I to go

 Pre-Chorus Kelly
 I can't
 Believe that you can't feel my heart
 And I can't
 Believe you made me fall so hard
 Stop playing
 How could you let it go this far
 If you had doubts that I wasn't the one
 And you said
 That you're the type to take it slow
 And you said
 Before I step I'll let you know
 Stop playing
 Before you let me see you with her
 You could've told me a change was going to come

 Chorus
 Is she the reason you don't call like you use to
 Ball through my hood like you use to
 Or put it on me hard like you use to do
 I feel in mind what's going on
 But my heart won't let me go until I know
 Is she the reason that my calls couldn't reach you
 The deepest of my love couldn't please you
 Or bring it to me home like you use to do
 Seeing her falling for your charm
 Got me feeling like I wasn't good enough

 [Verse 2:] Beyonce
 See I know we not official (no)
 But us being official ain't never been an issue (no)
 It came down to us
 Boy remember we were different
 We said that we'd talk
 If we ever had problems about anything
 I was cool with no commitment (wait)
 Let me take that back
 It was you so I was with it (see)
 Guess I didn't get
 When you showed you didn't miss it
 Now it seems that your interest ain't here
 And we ain't the same

 Pre-Chorus Kelly

 Chorus

 Bridge Michelle
 All you had to say was this ain't what you want
 I wouldn't be so hurt and I could just move on
 You had me believing, everything was my fault
 But I can see now
 It's a situation that I must let go
 Cause you ain't going to be a man and let me know
 I guess me seeing you with her
 Says it all

 Chorus Out with Ad-libs
