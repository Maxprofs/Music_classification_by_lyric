                        (Chorus)
she was covered in leather and gold, 21 years old
i lost her in the cold
it's unfair, she's out there
somewhere, somewhere, somewhere in Brooklyn
she's somewhere, somewhere, somewhere in Brooklyn

little miss perfect sitting at the train stop
red nike high tops listening to hip-hop
while we were waiting started conversating
before i got her name along came a train

...next stop Brooklyn

now i'm lookin'

(Chorus)

on the street kickin' rocks circling the same block
green farm flatbush
checking every corner shop
tappin' people's shoulders askin if they know her
everyday's the same back to the train

...I'm still lookin

(Chorus)

Ohhh Ohh Oh Oh Ohhh
i wonder will we ever meet again
Ohhh Ohh Oh Oh Ohhh
i wonder will we ever meet again
yeahh...i wonder if we'll ever meet again
i hope we do somewhere in Brooklyn
                        
                    |
