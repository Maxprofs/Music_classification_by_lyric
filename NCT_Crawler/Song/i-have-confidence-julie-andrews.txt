                        I have confidence in sunshine.
 I have confidence in rain.
 I have confidence that spring will come again
 Besides which you see I have confidence in me.
 Strength doesn't lie in numbers.
 Strength doesn't lie in wealth.
 Strength lies in nights of peaceful slumbers.
 When you wake up,wake up!It's healthy.
 All I trust I leave my heart to.
 All I trust becomes my own.
 I have confidence and confidence alone
 Besides which you see I have confidence in me.


 Let them bring on any problems.
 I'll do better than my best.
 I have confidence they'll put me to the test,
 But, I'll make them see I have confidence in me.
 Somehow I will impress them.
 I will be firm but kind.
 And all those children, heaven bless them,
 They will look up to me and mind me.
 With each step I am more certain.
 Ev'rything will turn out fine.
 I have confidence the world can all be mine.
 They"ll have to agree I have confidence in me.
