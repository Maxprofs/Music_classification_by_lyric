                        Don't wanna hurt you with my honesty
 But it seems to be causing friction between you and me
 When I mention anything 'bout my first love, my first love You always asking questions about me
 Way I used to be, way back when I first came on the scene
 Which some how ends leading back to my first love, my first love Why you always, always making things so complicated
 When you know I'm only about you, about you
 This is crazy, I don't understand when you know
 Know that I'm your man, no feelings, it's all left in the past
 You know it's all about you I will never talk 'bout my first love again
 'Cause I know there's a chance to hurt you
 And I really don't know what I'd do if I lost you So I will never talk 'bout my first love again
 'Cause I know there's a chance to hurt you
 After all of the things we've been through I want you So many times I tell you I love you and girl that's the truth
 But you be thinking I be playing with you
 And that I am really over my first love, my first love I'd give the world to you and so much more
 Just to know that you'll really hold me down and ride for me
 That's why I'm with you girl and not my first love, oh girl Why you always, always making things so complicated
 When you know I'm only about you, about you
 This is crazy, I don't understand when you know
 Know that I'm your man, no feelings, it's all left in the past
 You know it's all about you I will never talk 'bout my first love again
 'Cause I know there's a chance to hurt you
 And I really don't know what I'd do if I lost you So I will never talk 'bout my first love again
 'Cause I know there's a chance to hurt you
 After all of the things we've been through I want you Girl I gotta tell so you know she ain't a part of me no more
 You're the only girl I love, so let it go
 I don't wanna be with her for sure
 And I told you this before, I'm never walking out the door, oh, girl You complete me, maybe one day be my wife
 So glad to have you in my life
 Every day constantly got you on my mind
 Wanna be with you until the end of time
 Oh my girl, oh baby can't you see? I will never talk 'bout my first love again
 'Cause I know there's a chance to hurt you
 And I really don't know what I'd do if I lost you So I will never talk 'bout my first love again
 'Cause I know there's a chance to hurt you
 After all of the things we've been through I want you I will never talk 'bout my first love again
 'Cause I know there's a chance to hurt you
 And I really don't know what I'd do if I lost you
