                        Since you were an angel from the sky 
You fill my fantasy 
The way you look takes me so high 
You're everything to me 

And on my wall there's your photograph 
How I'm longing for your smile 
So come and touch me 
Come and feel me 
Hear me cry 

You're my love, you're my life 
Everyday, every night 
Is it right, what i feel 
How i wish you were for real 

You're my love, you're my life 
Everyday, every night 
In my dreams, I'm with you 
Will you make my dreams come true ? 

I'm all alone the night has come 
You're in my radio 
It's when you sing i feel the sun 
Now i can feel the show 

Since forever more you're my destiny 
Take my loneliness away 
So come and touch me 
Come and feel me 
Hear me say 

You're my love, you're my life 
Everyday, every night 
Is it right, what i feel 
How i wish you were for real 

You're my love, you're my life 
Everyday, every night 
In my dreams, I'm with you 
Will you make my dreams come true? 

Since forevermore you're my destiny 
Take my loneliness away 
So come and touch me 
Come and feel me 
Hear me say 

You're my love, you're my life 
Everyday, every night 
Is it right, What i feel 
How i wish you were for real 

You're my love, you're my life 
Everyday, every night 
In my dreams, I'm with you 
Will you make my dreams come true ?
