In my mind
Worlds collide
Something inside me is gone
Still I keep goin'' on
.
In my mind
Oceans divide
I don''t know where I belong
But still I keep holding on and on
.
I get by in a world with no conscience
By shouting it out and being anonymous
And the problem is
You''re just like me
We get by in a world with no conscience
By shouting it out and being anonymous
Hello hello hello
.
In my mind
Worlds collide
Something inside me is gone
Still I keep goin'' on
.
In my mind
Oceans divide
I don''t know where I belong
But still I keep holding on and on
.
I get by in a world with no conscience
By shouting it out and being anonymous
And the problem is
You''re just like me
We get by in a world with no conscience
By shouting it out and being anonymous
Anonymous

Hello hello hello hello

Is there anybody out there?

Hello hello hello hello
.

I get by in a world with no conscience
I try and I try but I am anonymous
And the problem is
You''re just like me
Just like me
.
I get by in a world with no conscience
By shouting it out and being anonymous
And the problem is
You''re just like me just like me
We get by in a world with no conscience
By shouting it out and being anonymous Hello hello hello
I feel so anonymous Hello hello hello
We feel so anonymous Hello hello hello
