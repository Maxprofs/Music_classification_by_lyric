[Justin Bieber] 
So you love me 
As much as I love you yeah 
Would you hurt me baby 
Could you do that to me yeah 
Would you lie to me baby 
Cause the truth hurts so much more 
Would you do the things that drive me crazy 
Be my heart still at the door 
Oh, I can't help it I'm just selfish 
There's no way that I could share you 
That would break my heart to pieces 
Honestly the truth is 

If I could just die in your arms 
I wouln't mind 
Cause everytime you touch me 
I just die in your arms 
Oooh, it feels so right 
So baby baby please don't stop girl 

Ooh, baby I know loving you ain't easy 
It sure is worth a try 

Ooh, if there is a reason to call me a fool 
Cause I love too hard 
Are there any rules baby 
This is the last time 
And baby teach me to behave 
Just tell me what I gotta do 
Just to stay right next to you 

Oh, I can't help it I'm just selfish 
There's no way that I could share you 
That would break my heart to pieces 
Honestly the truth is 

If I could just die in your arms 
I wouln't mind 
Cause everytime you touch me 
I just die in your arms 
Oooh, it feels so right 
So baby baby please don't stop girl 

Basically i'm staying here 
I can't live without my baby 
Loving you is so damn easy for me yeah 
Ain't no need for contemplating 
Promi se you won't keep me waiting 
Tell me baby, i'm all that you need 

If I could just die in your arms 
I wouln't mind 
Cause everytime you touch me 
I just die in your arms 
Oooh, it feels so right 
So baby baby please don't stop girl 

If I could just die in your arms 
Imma make you believe girl 
That I wouldn't mind 
Don't stop baby no
