                        Bài hát: Save The Best For Last - Vanessa Williams

Sometimes the snow comes down in June 
sometimes the sun goes 'round the moon 
I see the passion in your eyes 
sometimes It's all a big surprise 

'Cause there was a time when all I did was wish 
you'd tell me this was love 
It's not the way I hoped or how I planned 
but some how it's enough 

And now we're standing face to face 
Isn't this world a crazy place 
just when I thought our chance had passed 
you go and save the best for last 

All of the night you came to me 
when so silly girl have set you free 
you wondered how you'd make it through 
I wondered what was wrong with you 

'Cause how could you give your love to someone else 
and share your dreams with me 
sometimes the very thing your looking for 
is the one thing you can't see 

And now we're standing face to face 
Isn't this world a crazy place 
just when I thought our chance had passed 
you go and save the best for last 

Sometimes the very thing your looking for 
is the one thing you can't see 

Sometimes the snow comes down in June 
sometimes the sun goes 'round the moon 
just when I thought our chance had passed 
You go and save the best for last 
You go and save the best for last
                        
                    |
