                        I think I'm walkin' down your street
 I sense a silent shuffle to my heartbeat
 Why cry, I'll just fade
 Fade you away
 I watch your window from the street
 I guess I'll etch a vision in my daydreams of you
 Of you, of you, but you
 Never thought I'd be so proud-
 But I will never live without you
 Oh, oh, oh, oh, fade
 Fade you away, I will fade, fade you away
 I think I'm walkin' down your street...
