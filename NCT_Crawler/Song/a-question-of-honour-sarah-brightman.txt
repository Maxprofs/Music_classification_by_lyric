                        Ebbene? ... N'andr lontana,
Come va l'eco della pia camana,
L, fra la neve bianca;
L, fra le nubi d'or;
L, dov' la speranza, la speranza
Il rimpianto, il rimpianto, e il dolor!
Well? I will go far,
As the echo of the devout bell goes,
Here, between the snow white woman;
Here, between clouds of or;
Here, dov' it is the hope, the hope
The regret, the regret, and the dolor!
Ebbene? ... N'andr lontana,
L, dov' la speranza, la speranza
Il rimpianto
Sola e lontana!
Well? N' I will go far,
Here, dov' it is the hope, the hope
The regret
Single and far!
Two men collide
When two men collide, when two men collide
It's a question of honour
Two men collide
When two men collide, when two men collide
It's a question of honour
Two men collide
When two men collide, when two men collide
If you win or you lose, it's a question of honour
And the way that you choose, it's a question of honour
I can't tell what's wrong or right
If black is white or day is night
But I know when two men collide
It's a question of honour
If you win or you lose, it's a question of honour
And the way that you choose, it's a question of honour
If you win or you lose, it's a question of honour
And the way that you choose, it's a question of honour
I can't tell what's wrong or right
If black is white or day is night
I know when two men collide
It's a question of honour
Ebbene? ... N'andr lontana,
Come l'eco della pia campana,
L, fra la neve bianca;
L, fra le nubi d'or;
N'andr, n'andr sola e lontana!
E fra le nubi d'or!
Well? N' I will go far,
Like the echo of the devout bell,
Here, between the snow white woman;
Here, between clouds of or;
N' I will go, n' I will go single and far!
And between clouds of or!
