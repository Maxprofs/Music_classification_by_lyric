                        Bài hát: Melt The Snow - Shayne Ward

Sometimes out my window
I notice that you've been crying over him
And I wonder why you just don't
Kick him to the curb
instead of giving in

[Chorus]
You see love at first it's summer time
That's when you think that everything's fine
No one ever thinks its gonna end
But when things go wrong and winter comes
You're gonna need to run to someone
Left alone you'll just freeze up again
But you should know
When it gets too cold
You're not alone
I'll melt the snow

Some nights I can hear you
Screaming on the phone over
something that he did
And I wonder what can I do
To make you throw him out
so you can let me in

[Chorus]

I'll melt the snow
I'll melt the snow [x6]

[Chorus x2]

But you should know
When it gets too cold
You're not alone
I'll melt the snow
I'll melt the snow
                        
                    |
