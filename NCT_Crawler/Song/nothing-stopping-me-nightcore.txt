                        Bài hát: Nothing Stopping Me - Nightcore

Just when I realize 
That you been shouting me out 
I start to reach for the sky 
and nothing's falling down. 

Everybody knows, how the story goes, 
But fairy tales have been lying to me 
Every time I try, you just run and hide 
Now I'm finally feeling free. 

Tell me can you see me now, 
While I rise above the crowd 
Who would known I'd make it out 
Your broken world (No) 

You thought you tore me down 
I'm not giving up, now you know 
So tell me can you see me now 
Rising above 
And nothing's stopping me now! 

[DROP] 
(And nothing's stopping me now x2) 

Now I know my feet, 
They won't fail me now 
So thanks for showing me, 
All that I am about 

Everybody knows, how the story goes, 
But fairy tales have been lying to me 
Every time I try, you just run and hide 
Now I'm finally feeling free. 

Tell me can you see me now, 
While I rise above the crowd 
Who would known I'd make it out 
Your broken world (No) 

You thought you tore me down, 
I'm not giving up, now you know 
So tell me can you see me now 
Rising above 
And nothing's stopping me now! 

[DROP] 
(And nothing's stopping me now) 

So can you see me, now (ow)? 
Can you see me, now (ow) 

Tell me can you see me now, 
While I rise above the crowd 
Who would known I'd make it out 
Your broken world (No) 

You thought you tore me down 
I'm not giving up, now you know 
So tell me can you see me now 
Rising above 
And nothing's stopping me now!
