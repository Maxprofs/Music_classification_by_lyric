                        Song: House Of Mercy - Sarah Jarosz

In the middle of the night again
Still water and the birds don't sing
Cold gin in the back room humming
Medicating for the trouble that's coming

Walls rattle like a diesel freighter
Blood races like a wave
This house wasn't meant for strangers
But you come knocking anyway

I can hear you knocking on the door
I won't leave it open for you anymore
I can hear you knocking on the door
Knocking on the door of the house of mercy

Don't try to change my mind
That knock gets louder all the time
Don't try to wear me down
You'll never get inside this house

Underneath that shirt you're wearing
Strained muscles and a heart of stone
Double crossing like a wild chameleon
You make me want to be alone

I can hear you knocking on the door
I won't leave it open for you anymore
I can hear you knocking on the door
Knocking on the door of the house of mercy

Don't try to change my mind
That knock gets louder all the time
Don't try to wear me down
You'll never get inside this house

I can hear you knocking on the door
I won't leave it open for you anymore
I can hear you knocking on the door
Knocking on the door of the house of mercy
