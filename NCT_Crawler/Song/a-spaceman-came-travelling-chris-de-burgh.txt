                        A spaceman came traveling on his ship from afar
 'Twas light years of time since his mission did start
 And over a village he halted his craft
 And it hung in the sky like a star, just like a star He followed a light and came down to a shed
 Where a mother and child were lying there on a bed
 A bright light of silver shone round his head
 And he had the face of an angel and they were afraid Then the stranger spoke, he said, "Do not fear
 I come from a planet a long way from here
 And I bring a message for mankind to hear"
 And suddenly the sweetest music filled the air And it went la la la la la la la la la
 La la la la la la la, la la la la la la la la la
 Peace and goodwill to all men and love for the child
 La la la la la la la la la, la la la la la la la, la la la la la la la la la, oh This lovely music went trembling through the ground
 And many were awakened on hearing that sound
 And travelers on the road
 The village they found by the light of that ship in the sky
 Which shone all around And just before dawn at the paling of the sky
 The stranger returned and said, "Now I must fly
 When two thousand years of your time has gone by
 This song will begin once again to a baby's cry" And it goes la la la la la la la la la
 La la la la la la la, la la la la la la la la la
 Peace and goodwill to all men and love for the child
 And I hear la la la la la la la la la
 La la la la la la la, la la la la la la la la la
 This song will begin once again to a baby's cry Oh the whole world is waiting, waiting to hear the song again
 There are thousands standing on the edge of the world
 And a star is moving somewhere, the time is nearly here
 This song will begin once again to a baby's cry
                        
                    |
