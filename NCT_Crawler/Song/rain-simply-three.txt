                        Bài hát: Rain - Simple Three

Looking through the hour glass
Counting teardrops slowly rolling down
Time has never been enough
Never been enough to let me drown
Between the grass and those white clouds
There is so much distance I found

[Refrain:]
The only one moment that I can touch the sky
Is when the rain comes falling over me like this tonight
It's as if the heavens could sympathize with me
When my heart begins longing for love to hold 
Like when the sky kisses the oceaN through the rain

When the sun warms the sea
Like the morning I met you that day
Dark clouds started gathering
Here I am to face another rain
Soon the wind will blow the storm away
To show the rainbow once again

[Refrain:]
The only one moment that I can touch the sky
Is when the rain comes falling over me like this tonight
It's as if the heavens could sympathize with me
When my heart begins longing for love to hold 
Like when the sky kisses the ocean through the rain

[Bridge:]
Raindrops please keep pouring in my heart this time
Because I don't even mind
If the cold would embrace my warmest smile inside

[Refrain:]
The only one moment that I can touch the sky
Is when the rain comes falling over me like this tonight
It's as if the heavens could sympathize with me
When my heart begins longing for love to hold like
When you come to me for a moment
I see the sky appears in yours eyes
Calling your name is like the rain that cries
All this longing to heavens to sympathize with me
When my heart begins looking for you in every raindrop
The only one moment that I can touch the sky
Is whenever love falls over me like rain tonight
                        
                    |
