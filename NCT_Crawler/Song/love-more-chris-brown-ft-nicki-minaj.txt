                        Bài hát: Love More - Chris Brown, Nicki Minaj

[Verse 1: Chris Brown]
You say all you need is consistent love
When I try I swear it’s never enough - I messed up
Maybe this thing here just ain’t meant for us
Maybe this thing here just ain’t meant for us
Baby you let go and I pull you back
I let go, you ain't having that

[Bridge: Chris Brown]
We do it like we rock stars
Sexing in my hotel room, I be so loud
Higher than a smoke cloud
Shades on doing 95 with the top down
I might sound crazy
Cause we be going back and forth
One minute I hate you, and I love you
That’s just how it is

[Hook: Chris Brown]
‘Til we get it right we gon' *** some mo' (‘til we get it)
I'mma get it (I'ma get it), 'til we get it ('til we get it)
'Til we get it right we gon’ *** some mo’ (Im'a get it)
I'mma get it ('Til get it), 'til we get it (Im'a get it)

[Verse 2: Chris Brown]
Why is it all so complicated
Baby this should be simple, it’s driving me mental
But when you back it up it really drives me crazy
And you know what I’m into, make me forget what we arguing about
Aye

[Bridge]

[Hook]

[Verse 3: Nicki Minaj]
Yo, he don’t know me but he setting up to blow me, uh
Said my Twitter pics remind him of Naomi, uh
On the low I used to holla at his homie, uh
*** it, now I’m about to ride him like a pony, yeah
Okay, thug prolly, yo come polly
He wanna *** a bad Dolly and pop Molly
I hope your pockets got a mutha***in' pot belly
Or is it that you never ball? John Salley
He had the Rolls in his Royce, the tone in his voice
Don’t want a good girl, now hoes is his choice
D-D-Dick on H, pussy on W
Mouth on open, ass on smother you
Ass on the cover too, Elle Magazine
Vroom, vroom, vroom, get gasoline
Could I be your wife? Naw we could bang though
I got these niggas whipped — call me Django
