                        No, nevermind
 'Cause you're home now
 Yeah, you're home Time never hides
 We're alone now
 Leave it all behind Wherever I go I know, I'll tell you
 It's just another place, we can go to
 So get on board You gave it all, don't take it back
 Been up all night, just talking
 The day is dawning
 It's early morning So, catch your breath
 It's so clear now
 'Cause you're here now Wherever I go I know, I'll tell you
 It's just another place, we can go to
 So get on board You gave it all, don't take it back
 Been up all night, just talking
 The day is dawning
 It's early morning You gave it all, don't take it back
 Been up all night, just talking
 The day is dawning
 It's early morning The day is dawning
 It's early morning No, nevermind
 'Cause you're home now
 The day is dawning
 It's early morning
