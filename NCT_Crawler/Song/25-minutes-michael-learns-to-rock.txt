                        Bài hát: 25 Minutes - Michael Learns To Rock 

After sometime 
I fin'lly made up my mind she is the girl 
And I really want to make her mine 
I'm searching everywhere to find her again to tell her 
I love her and I'm sorry about the things I've done 
I find her standing in front of the church 
The only place in town 
Where I didn't search she looks so happy in her wedding dress 
But she's crying while she's saying this 
Boy I miss your kisses 
All the time but this is twenty five minutes too late 
Through you're tried it so far 
Boy I'm sorry you're a twenty five minutes too late 
Again the wind 
I'm going home again hmm wishing me back to the time when we were more than friends 
But I still I see her in front of the church 
The only place in town 
Where I didn't search she looks so happy in her wedding dress 
But she's crying while she's saying this 
Boy I miss your kisses 
All the time but this is twenty five minutes too late 
Through you're tried it so far 
Boy I'm sorry you're a twenty five minutes too late 
Out in the street 
Places where heart bring heart with nothing to keep inside my head 
Still I can hear the words she says 
Boy I miss your kisses 
All the time but this is twenty five minutes too late 
Through you're tried 
Boy I'm sorry you're a twenty five minutes too late 
Boy I miss your kisses 
All the time but this is twenty five minutes too late 
Through you're tried it so far 
Boy I'm sorry you're a twenty five minutes too late 
I can still hear her say 
I can still hear her say
