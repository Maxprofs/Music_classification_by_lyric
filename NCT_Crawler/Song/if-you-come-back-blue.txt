                        For all this time, I've been lovin' you girl, oh yes I have.
Every since the day you left me here alone,
I've been trying to find, oh the reason why.

So if I did something wrong please tell me, I wanna understand.
Cos I don't want this love to ever end.

I swear, If you come back in my life I'll be there till the end of time, Oh yeah.
(Back to me, back to me, back into my life).
And I swear, I'll keep you right by my side 'cos baby you're the one I want,
Oh yes you are. (Back to me, back to me, back into my life).

I watched you go, takin' my heart with you, oh yes you did.
And every time I try to reach you on the phone,
Baby you're never there, girl you're never home.

So if I did something wrong please tell me, I wanna understand.
'Cos I don't want this love to ever end

I swear, if you come back in my life I'll be there till the end of time, Oh yeah.
(Back to me, back to me, back into my life).
And I swear, I'll keep you right by my side 'cos baby you1re the one I want,
Oh yes you are. (Back to me, back to me, back into my life).

Maybe I didn't know how to show it. Maybe I didn't know what to say.
This time I won't disguise, then we can build our lives and we can be as one.

I swear, if you come back in my life I'll be there till the end of time, Oh yeah.
(Back to me, back to me, back into my life).
And I swear, I'll keep you right by my side 'cos baby you're the one I want,
Oh yes you are. (Back to me, back to me, Baby come back, I swear).
