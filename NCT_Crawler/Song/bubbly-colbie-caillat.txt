                        I've been awake for a while now
You've got me feelin' like a child now
Cause every time I see your bubbly face
I get the tingles in a silly place

It starts in my toes
And I crinkle my nose
Where ever it goes
I always know
That you make me smile
Please stay for a while now
Just take your time
Where ever you go

The rain is falling on my window pane
But we are hiding in a safer place
Under cover staying dry and warm
You give me feelings that I adore

They start in my toes
Make me crinkle my nose
Where ever it goes
I always know
That you make me smile
Please stay for a while now
Just take your time
Where ever you go

What am I gonna say
When you make me feel this way
I just- mmm...

It starts in my toes


Makes me crinkle my nose
Where ever it goes
I always know
That you make me smile
Please stay for a while now
Just take your time
Where ever you go

Dada dada dadada dada ***....

Mmm mm...

I've been asleep for a while now
You tuck me in just like a child now
'Cause every time you hold me in your arms
I'm comfortable enough to feel your warmth

It starts in my soul
And I lose all control
When you kiss my nose
The feeling shows
Cause you make me smile baby
Just take your time now
Holdin' me tight

Where ever, where ever, where ever you go
Where ever, where ever, where ever you go

Where ever you go
I always know
Cause you make me smile
Even just for a while
                        
                    |
