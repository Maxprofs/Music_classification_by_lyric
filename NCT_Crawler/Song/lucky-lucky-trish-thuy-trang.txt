                        Do you hear me, I'm talking to you
Across the water, across the deep, blue ocean
Under the open sky, oh my, baby i'm trying

Boy I hear you, in my dream
I feel your whisper across the sea
I keep you with me in my heart
You make me easier when life get hard

I'm lucky i'm in love with my best friend
Lucky to have been, where i have been
Lucky to be coming home again

They don't know how long it takes
Wait for a love like this
Every time we say goodbye
I wish we had one more kiss
I wait for you, i promise you, i will...mad

I'm lucky i'm in love with my best friend
Lucky to have been, where i have been
Lucky to be coming home again

I'm lucky we're in love in every way
Lucky to have stayed where we have stayed
Lucky to be coming home some day

And so i'm sailing through the sea
To an Island where we'll meet
You'll hear the music fill the air
I put a flower in your hand
Through the breezes through the trees
Move so pretty you're all i see
As the world keep spinning round
You hold me, right here right now

I'm lucky i'm in love with my best friend
Lucky to have been, where i have been
Lucky to be coming home again

I'm lucky we're in love in every way
Lucky to have stayed where we have stayed
Lucky to be coming home some day
                        
                    |
