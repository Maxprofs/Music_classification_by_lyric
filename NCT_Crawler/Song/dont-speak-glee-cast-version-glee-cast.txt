                        Bài hát: Don't Speak (Glee Cast Version) - Glee Cast

[Finn:]
You and me 
We used to be together 
Everyday together 
Always

[Blaine:]
I really feel 
That I'm losing my best friend 
I can't believe
This could be the end

[Rachel and Kurt:]
It looks as though you're letting go
And if it's real 
Well I don't want to know

[Rachel and Finn:]
Don't speak 
I know just what you're saying
So please stop explaining 
Don't tell me cause it hurts 

[Kurt and Blaine:]
Don't speak 
I know what you're thinking 
I don't need your reasons 
Don't tell me cause it hurts

[Finn and Kurt:]
Our memories 
Well, they can be inviting 
But some are altogether 
Mighty frightening 

[Rachel and Blaine:]
As we die, both you and I 
With my head in my hands 
I sit and cry

[Rachel and Finn:]
Don't speak 
I know just what you're saying 
So please stop explaining
Don't tell me cause it hurts 

No, no, no

[Blaine and Kurt:]
Don't speak 
I know what you're thinking 
I don't need your reasons 
Don't tell me cause it hurts

[Rachel and Finn:]
It's all ending 
I gotta stop pretending who we are... 

[Rachel:]
You and me I can see us dying
Are we?

[Rachel and Blaine:]
Don't speak 
I know just what you're saying 
So please stop explaining
Don't tell me cause it hurts 

No, no 

Don't speak 
I know what you're thinking 
I don't need your reasons 
Don't tell me cause it hurts 
Don't tell me cause it hurts! 

[Rachel and Kurt:]
I know what you're saying 
So please stop explaining

[Blaine and Rachel:]
Don't speak!
Don't speak! 
Don't speak! Oh! 

[Rachel and Finn:]
I know what you're thinking 
And I don't need your reasons 
I know you're good 
I know you're good 
I know you're real good oh!

[Blaine, Kurt, Rachel and Finn:]
La la la la la la La la la la la la 

[Rachel:]
Don't, Don't, uh-huh Hush, hush darlin' 
Hush, hush darlin' 

[Blaine, Kurt and Finn:] Oh, la la la la la la La la la la la la

[Blaine, Kurt, Rachel, Finn:]
Oh! Don't tell me cause it hurts!

[Rachel:]
Hush, darlin' Hush, darlin' 

[Blaine, Kurt and Finn:] Oh, la la la la la la La la la la la la

[Blaine, Kurt, Rachel and Finn:]
Don't tell me tell me cause it hurts! 
Don't tell me cause it hurts
                        
                    |
