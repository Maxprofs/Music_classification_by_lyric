                        We’re under pressure,
Seven billion people in the world trying to fit in
Keep it together,
Smile on your face even though your heart is frowning
But hey now, you know, babe,
We both know it’s a cruel world
But I will take my chances
As long as you love me
We could be starving, we could be homeless, we could be broke
As long as you love me
I’ll be your platinum, I’ll be your silver, I’ll be your gold
As long as you love me, love me, love me, love me 
As long as you love me, love me, love me, love me 

I’ll be your soldier,
Fighting every second of the day for your dreams, babe
I’ll be your Hova
You can be my Destiny’s Child on the scene babe
So don’t stress, don’t cry, we don’t need no wings to fly
Just take my hands
As long as you love me
We could be starving, we could be homeless, we could be broke
As long as you love me
I’ll be your platinum, I’ll be your silver, I’ll be your gold
As long as you love, love, love, love me (love me)
As long as you love, love, love, love me (love me)
As long as you love me (Love me yeah yeah yeah)
We could be starving, we could be homeless, we could be broke
As long as you love me
I’ll be your platinum, I’ll be your silver, I’ll be your gold
As long as you love, love, love, love me
As long as you love, love, love, love me
As long as you love, love, love, love me (I’ll be your silver, I’ll be your gold)
As long as you love, love, love, love me
As long as you love, love, love, love me
As long as you love me
