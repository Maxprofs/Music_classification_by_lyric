                        Bài hát: Cheerleader - Howard Shore

When i need motivation 
My one solution is my queen 
'Cause she' stay strong yeah yeah 
She is always in my corner 
Right there when i want her 
All these other girls are tempting 
But i'm empty when you're gone 
And they say 
Do you need me 
Do you think i'm pretty 
Do i make you feel like cheating. 
And i'm like no, not really 'cause 


Oh i think that i found myself a cheerleader 
She is always right there when i need her 
Oh i think that i found myself a cheerleader 
She is always right there when i need her 


She walks like a model 
She grants my wishes like a genie in a bottle yeah yeah 
'Cause i'm the wizard of love 
And i got the magic wand 
All these other girls are tempting 
But i'm empty when you're gone 
And they say 
Do you need me? 
Do you think i'm pretty? 
Do i make you feel like cheating. 
And i'm like no, not really cause' 

Oh i think that i found myself a cheerleader 
She is always right there when i need her 
Oh i think that i found myself a cheerleader 
She is always right there when i need her 
She gives me love and affection 
Baby did i mention, you're the only girl for me 
No i don't need a next one 
Mama loves you too, she thinks i made the right selection 
Now all that's left to do 
Is just for me to pop the question 
Oh i think that i found myself a cheerleader 
She is always right there when i need her
