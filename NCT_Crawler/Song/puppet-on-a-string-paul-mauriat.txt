Words & Music by Sid Tepper / Roy C. Bennett

Every time you look at me,
I'm as helpless as can be.
I become a puppet on a string,
you can do 'most anything with me.

All you do is touch my hand,
and your wish is my command.
I become a puppet on a string,
and you can do 'most anything with me.

If you really love me,
Darling, please be kind.
I offer you the truest love
that you will ever find.

Take my heart and please be fair,
handle it with loving care.
For I'm just a puppet on a string,
you can do 'most anything with me.

If you really love me,
Darling, please be kind.
I offer you the truest love
that you will ever find.

Take my heart and please be fair,
handle it with loving care.
For I'm just a puppet on a string,
You can do 'most anything with me.
You can do 'most anything with me..
