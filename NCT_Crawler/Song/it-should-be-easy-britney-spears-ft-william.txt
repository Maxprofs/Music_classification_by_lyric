                        Bài hát: It Should Be Easy - Britney Spears, will.i.am

[Verse 1] 
I've been thinking, just sitting thinking 
On why I love you and all the reasons 
And if I lost you boy, if I lost you 
I'd lose myself and I wouldn't feel the way I feel now 
You bring me zen, yes you bring me zen 
And you make me feel like a million billion 
I let you in but don't you break my heart 
Don't you rip me apart 
Don't you rip me apart 

[Chorus: Will.I.Am] 
Baby love 
It should be easy 
It shouldn't be complicated 
It should be easy 
I dont know how or where else to say it 

[Verse 2] 
I've got visions boy, I've got visions 
Of me and you happily just livin' 
I know they're out there, them beautiful men 
But you my future baby, you my right now 
If there was a scale from one to ten 
My love for you is a million billion 
Boy I'll love you til the day I'm dead 
So please don't mess with my head 
Please don't mess with my head 

[Chorus] 

[Bridge] 
La di dee, la di dah 
It's the only way you are 
La di dee, la di dah 
It's the only way you are 
I don't know how to say it 

[Chorus] 

[Bridge]
                        
                    |
