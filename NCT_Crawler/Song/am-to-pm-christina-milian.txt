R&B/Hip Hop/Rap|

                        Somebody hit the lights, so we can rock it day and night
 People getting' down, that's right, from AM to PM
 Everybody lookin' like stars, all the chicks and the fellas in the bars
 All of y'all bumpin' this in your cars, from AM to PM Bloodshy, Milian Everybody wanna get down when you hear the sound
 And you bump the beat
 Three sixty-five days a year, twenty-four a day
 Seven days a week Now when you're driving in your four by four
 And you turn this up on your stereo
 Whether night or day, non-stop you'll play
 And you know you still want more So find a honey that's standing on the wall
 All the girls get the guys on the floor
 From the front to the back let's go
 Hear this Somebody hit the lights, so we can rock it day and night
 People getting' down, that's right, from AM to PM
 Everybody lookin' like stars, all the chicks and the fellas in the bars
 All of y'all bumpin' this in your cars, from AM to PM Ooh, yeah Everybody in the club c'mon keep bobbin' your head
 Now to this song
 You got the beats and breaks and your body shake
 And we're doin' it all night long Any time or place, any place or time
 No, we don't need no sleep.
 Three sixty-five days a year, twenty-four a day
 Seven days a week So find a honey that's standing on the wall
 All the girls get the guys on the floor
 From the front to the back let's go
 Hear this Somebody hit the lights, so we can rock it day and night
 People getting' down, that's right, from AM to PM
 Everybody lookin' like stars, all the chicks and the fellas in the bars
 All of y'all bumpin' this in your cars, from AM to PM Somebody hit the lights, so we can rock it day and night
 People getting' down, that's right, from AM to PM
 Everybody lookin' like stars, all the chicks and the fellas in the bars
 All of y'all bumpin' this in your cars, from AM to PM From the front to the back c'mon and bob your head, yeah
 Three sixty-five days a year, twenty-four a day, yeah, yeah
 No, we don't need no sleep, all night we rock that beat
 So you know what to do, just make it move and make it move, yeah So find a honey that's standing on the wall
 All the girls get the guys on the floor
 From the front to the back let's go
 Hear this Somebody hit the lights, so we can rock it day and night
 People getting' down, that's right, from AM to PM
 Everybody lookin' like stars, all the chicks and the fellas in the bars
 All of y'all bumpin' this in your cars, from AM to PM Somebody hit the lights, so we can rock it day and night
