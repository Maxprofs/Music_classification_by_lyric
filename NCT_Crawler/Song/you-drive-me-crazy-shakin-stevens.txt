                        Bài hát: You Drive Me Crazy - Shakin' Stevens

You know, Baby, when youre in my arms,
I can feel your loving magic charms
You drive me crazy, you drive me crazy.

And when Im looking in those big blue eyes,
I start afloating round in paradise,
You drive me crazy, you drive me crazy.

Heaven must have sent you down,
Down for you to give me a thrill,
Evry time you touch me
Evry time you hold me,
My heart starts speeding like a train on a track.

I love you, Baby, and its plain to see,
I love you, honey, it was meant to be
You drive me crazy, you drive me crazy, oh.

Heaven must have sent you down,
Down for you to give me a thrill,
Evry time you touch me
Evry time you hold me,
My heart starts speeding like a train on a track.

I love you, Baby, and its plain to see,
I love you, honey, it was meant to be
You drive me crazy, you drive me crazy, oh.

And when Im looking in those big blue eyes,
I start afloating round in paradise,
You drive me crazy, you drive me crazy.

You drive me crazy, you drive me crazy
