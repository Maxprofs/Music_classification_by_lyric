                        Bài hát : Break Your Heart - Taio Cruz

Now listen to me baby 

Before i love and leave you

They call me heart breaker

I don't wanna decieve you

If you fall for me

I'm not easy to please

I'm might tear you apart

Told you from the start,baby from the start

I'm only gonna break break your break break your heart (x4)

Theres no point trying to hide it

No point trying to evade it

I know i got a problem

Problem with this behaving

If you fall for me

I'm not easy to please

I'm might tear you apart

Told you from the start,baby from the start

I'm only gonna break break your break break your heart (x4)

And i know karmas gonna get me back for being so cold

Like a big bad wolf i'm born to be bad bad to the bone

If you fall for me

I'm might tear you apart

Told you from the start

I'm only gonna break break your break break your heart (x8)
