                        Bài hát: Sound Of My Dream (Remix) - DJ

I, I want to go
I want to run
Run to the places where I can be
I wanna know
What is the sound
Sound that is something that's reminding me

I, want to go
I got to run
Run to the moment that set me free
You tell me why
I hear the sound
The sound of my dreams

So now
Now is the time to make it right
Now is the time to feel the heat
This is my place
I'll stay tonight
Just move your body to the beat

I, I want to go
I want to run
Run to the places where I can be
I wanna know
What is the sound
Sound that is something that's reminding me

I, want to go
I got to run
Run to the moment that set me free
You tell me why
I hear the sound
The sound of my dreams
