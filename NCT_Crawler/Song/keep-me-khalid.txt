                        Bài hát: Keep Me - Khalid

[Verse 1]
Roses were your favorite flower
And I couldn't stand the scent
But if it's what it takes to put a smile on your face
I guess I'll deal with it
You hung with the popular kids
And I couldn't stand them
But I sucked it up, because I wanted to be more than friends

[Chorus]
You should walk away with me
In your heart
Keep me in your mind
You don't have to speak
Of our past, just
Keep me in your life
Keep me alive
Keep me alive
Keep me alive
Keep me alive
Keep me alive
Keep me alive
Ohhhhh
Nooooo
Ohhhhh
Nooooo


[Verse 2]
We were ridin' down Dyer with my top down
Singin' our favorite songs
But the funny thing is
Every time we did, you'd always get the words wrong
And I was your biggest fan
You should never forget it
I bet your new man
Doesn't love you like I did
Does he love you like I did?
Does he love you like I did?
Noooo...

[Chorus]
You should walk away with me
In your heart
Keep me in your mind
You don't have to speak
Of our past, just
Keep me in your life
Keep me alive

[Bridge]
Keep me alive
Keep me alive
Keep me alive
Keep me alive
Keep me alive
Keep me alive
Keep me alive
Keep me alive
Ohhhhh
Nooooo
Ohhhhh
Nooooo

[Outro]
You should walk away with me
In your heart
Keep me in your mind
You don't have to speak
Of our past, just
Keep me in your life
Keep me alive
Keep me alive
Keep me alive
Keep me alive
Keep me alive
Keep me alive
Ohhhhh
Nooooo
Ohhhhh
Nooooo
