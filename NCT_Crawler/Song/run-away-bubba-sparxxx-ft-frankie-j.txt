                        I wanna runaway, (I wanna runaway) with you (I wanna runaway)
 I wanna runaway...'cause baby youre my everything I dont need this
 All I need is us
 Cmon girl, lets put it in the wind
 I care none, bout no one
 If they loved us they shoulda did it when
 They had a chance
 But now the dance is over
 And for sure its highway time
 Let the top down
 Cant stop now
 Explain the past baby I aint tryin
 I aint lyin
 When sayin we came of age
 Ya know things dun change
 Time to spread our wings
 Fly to better things
 Pack your suitcase todays the day
 Dont tell yo mama, dont tell yo sister
 It will only complicate the issue
 We'll mail them a box of tissues
 The only one that loves you is right here with you
 Girl dont ever look back
 Our destiny awaits us
 In what ever place we park the brakes
 I work my hands to the ball
 If thats what it takes ta
 Give us everything
 Our folks never had
 Im prepared for that
 It may take a while
 But ima make you smile
 Forever
 I said a prayer for that
 And...I know hes listenin
 At least to this one
 If he never heard none of the others
 This is me and you
 And ima see it through
 From this highway to under the covers
 Baby
 (ohhh ohhh ohhh ohhh oooooo)
 I wanna runaway, (I wanna runaway) with you (I wanna runaway)
 I wanna runaway with you... 'cause baby youre my everything
 I wanna runaway, (I wanna runaway) with you (I wanna runaway)
 I wanna runaway...'cause baby youre my everything We got off the exit at Waco
 Frankie J was on the radio
 I asked her was she afraid to go
 All the way with this
 She delayed a no
 I said baby I jus need to know
 If you aint down
 We can turn around
 Your happiness is my happiness
 And thats the only thing thats concernin me now
 Just hurt me now
 She said would you please jus let me talk for once
 then all at once she went into how
 Shed been tryin to prevent this all for months
 Not all because she didnt love me
 And only me
 Its jus that she
 Had withheld one vital piece of info
 She looked up at me
 Wit both eyes full of tears
 She said you remember that day at the clinic?
 I went in wit the doctor and I told you I did it
 I wasnt able to go through wit it
 No you didnt
 How could you
 Wait minute that makes you what?
 Three months and some change
 Well baby doll that jus aint enough
 To derail us
 'cause see that jus means theres three of us
 Answer me this, at what point do you think this topic should be discussed
 I dont know whether to cry or smile
 But somehow im doin both
 But his changes nothin
 I got two babies and I solemnly swear to be true to both
 Baby (ohhh ohhh ohhh ohhh oooooo)
 I wanna runaway, (I wanna runaway) with you (I wanna runaway)
 I wanna runaway with you... 'cause baby youre my everything
 I wanna runaway, (I wanna runaway) with you (I wanna runaway)
 I wanna runaway...'cause baby youre my everything
 I wanna run, wanna runaway, theres nothing they can do er say to make us stay
 I wanna run, wanna runaway, theres nothing they can do theres nothin they can say
 I wanna run, wanna runaway..ahhhh oooh ohhh
 I wanna run, wanna runaway I want to runaway
 Baby
 I wanna runaway, (I wanna runaway) with you (I wanna runaway)
 I wanna runaway with you... 'cause baby youre my everything
