                        Bài hát: Still Got It - Usher, Migos

Talk about she looking for the check (Migos)
Talk about she looking for the check, check, check
Yeah I still got it
Talk about she looking for the check, check, check (Usher)

I still got it, I still got it, I still got it (You know I still got it)
All that trickin' off, nigga I could pull without it (I'm trickin' with bitches)
I still got it, I still got it, I still got it (You know I still got it)
I'mma vet in this thing, I'mma let ya'll young niggas have it
(Young nigga, young nigga, young nigga)

I could pull that bitch (she bet)
If I wanna (I don't want her)
I could have that car (skirrt skirrt)
If I wanna (I don't want it)
All your diamonds flawed (yo)
I don't want 'em (You're diamonds fugazi)
Vip is full with bad bitches (Gone)
Come here, come here baby (Come here)
Come and take a shot with me (come take a shot)
You can have whatever you want (You could have whatever)
Keep them bottles coming on me (Bottles on me)
*** whatever they think (*** with me)
All that talkin' don't phase me (*** with a nigga)
Anything I want, I can have it (ah)
Other niggas can't compete (hey!)

So you think I fell off?
What you talking about nigga? I'm too raw
(What you talkin' bout *** nigga, *** nigga)
And my city with me
So I really ain't worried 'bout nothing (ain't worried 'bout nothing)

I still got it, I still got it, I still got it (You know I still got it)
All that trickin' off, nigga I could pull without it (I'm trickin' with bitches)
I still got it, I still got it, I still got it (You know I still got it)
I'mma vet in this thing, I'mma let ya'll young niggas have it
(Young nigga, young nigga, young nigga)

At the party at my crib (party, party, party, party)
You already know it (Y'all already know it)
Ain't one person do it this big
You don't know 'em (You don't know ***)
So many girls in my bed
And they all waitin' on it (Let's wait on it)
Talkin' 'bout whatcha got (whatcha got lil b)
Show me something (Hey!)
Come here, come here baby
I put all your focus on me (All on me)
My crib's so god damn big
We can play a little hide and go seek (Hundred thousand square feet)
Name anything you want (what you want)
It's all on me (Balenciaga)
Once I'm done with ya body
You ain't ever gon' leave (Never ever ever ever gon' leave)

So you think I fell off? (No way Jose)
What you talking about nigga? I'm too raw
(What you talkin' nigga)
And my city with me (my city, my city)
So I really ain't worried 'bout nothing (ain't worried 'bout nothing)

I still got it, I still got it, I still got it (You know I still got it)
All that trickin' off, nigga I could pull without it (I'm trickin' with bitches)
I still got it, I still got it, I still got it (You know I still got it)
I'mma vet in this thing, I'mma let ya'll young niggas have it
(Young nigga, young nigga, young nigga) (word up)

Young nigga, young nigga, young nigga
You know I just got it, I love it, I can't live without it
Your momma told me her name was Master P
Got to know she bout it, bout it
(If Usher still got it, I got it
You get it, might pull up, we flexin' in Bentleys)
You get it? Two women they kissin'
Usher start trickin' off, let a young nigga pay the tip

Young rich nigga, I am authentic
Versace, Givenchy, red bottoms forensics
Usher my brother, we got different mothers
But blood can't bring a nigga no closer (my nigga nigga)
My nigga, she drop it, bend it over
I'm trickin' and treatin' but it ain't October
She got a bus on her back like Boosie
So I had to pull her over

Oh I still got it, I still got it, I still got it (You know I still got it) yeah I got it
All that trickin' off, nigga I could pull without it (I'm trickin' with bitches)
I still got it, I still got it, I still got it (Yeah I still got it)
I'mma vet in this thing, I'mma let ya'll young niggas have it
(Young nigga, young nigga, young nigga)
