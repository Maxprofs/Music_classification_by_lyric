                        Bài hát: No Holding Back - Craig David, Hardwell

Different girls, different nights
I learn about the city lights
When it came to relationships
Not a girl seem to get it right
Yeah, I used to hesitate
Now I don't wanna wait
No more, no more, no more, no more

I know that I've been away and that's a fact
Please don't get me wrong
But I don't wanna be the player that ends up all alone
And now that I have you in my heart, in my life
I'm here to get my own

I ain't holding back,
I ain't holding back
No, no
I ain't holding back,
I ain't holding back
No, no
I ain't holding back,
I ain't holding back
No, no

No holding back
No holding back
No holding back
No holding back
No holding back
No holding back
No holding back
No holding back

Girl, you shine so bright
And now I've seen the light
When I'm with you it's just like
Them other girls they fade to white
When a girl like you comes by
You gotta think about what's right
You know, you know, you know, you know

I know that I've been away and that's a fact
Please don't get me wrong
But I don't wanna be the player that ends up all alone
And now that I have you in my heart, in my life
I'm here to get my own

I ain't holding back,
I ain't holding back
No, no
I ain't holding back,
I ain't holding back
No, no
I ain't holding back,
I ain't holding back
No, no

No holding back
No holding back
No holding back
No holding back
No holding back
No holding back
No holding back
No holding back
