                        Bài hát: I Will - Citizen Way

When the shadow won’t leave
When the battle won’t stop
And every breath that you breathe
Takes all that you’ve got
When you wonder if you’re always
Gonna feel this way
Hear the Lord of heaven say
I will hold you when you’re breaking
Like a father and a friend
And I will carry you through darkness
‘Til we see the sun again
So rest your head and cry your tears
Know that I am with you here
When you can’t lift that weight
Believe me when I say I will
I know you’re feeling overwhelmed
Before the day even begins
But I can see beyond the now
This is not how your story ends
And when you’re at your weakest
Oh I’ve never been more strong
So let me be the one you’re leaning on
I will dry your eyes
I will calm your fears
I will show you how you’re beautiful beautiful
I will walk with you
On the raging sea
And I will never leave
When there’s a door that you can’t open
When there’s a war that you can’t win
I will I will I will
                        
                    |
