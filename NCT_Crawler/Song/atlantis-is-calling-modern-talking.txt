                        Bài hát: Atlantis Is Calling - Modern Talking


Lady, I know it was hard,but it's much harder to ignore...There's a chance and I'll promise,I won't hurt you anymore,Hollywood nights we're romancin'.You can trust me anytime somewhere, oh! babe there is someone,Oh! you're dancing in my mind 
 Ohoho... little queenie, I'm your fool. Come on, teach me the rules and I will send an S.O.S. for love 
 Ohoho... little queenie,I'm your fool you need love like I do and I will send a S.O.S. for love

 (chorus):
 Atlantis is calling, S.O.S. for love ,Atlantis is calling, from the stars above 
Atlantis is calling, S.O.S. for love, Atlantis is calling, it's too hot to stop

**2**
 If loving you is wrong babe. Oh, I don't wanna be right, I've got you under my skin, babe.. And baby, hold me tight, I'm ready for our romance, I wait a million years for you. I love you more than I'm saying. Baby that's for me the truth
Ohoho... little queenie, I'm your fool. Come on, teach me the rules and I will send an S.O.S. for love 
 Ohoho... little queenie,I'm your fool you need love like I do and I will send a S.O.S. for love

(chorus):
 Atlantis is calling, S.O.S. for love ,Atlantis is calling, from the stars above 
Atlantis is calling, S.O.S. for love, Atlantis is calling, it's too hot to stop
