                        Demi: 
Always been the kind of girl 
That hid my face 
So afraid to tell the world 
What I've got to say 
But i have this dream right inside of me 
I'm gonna let it show 
It's time to let you know 
To let you know 

This is real, this is me 
I'm exactly where I'm supposed to be now 
Let the light shine on me 
If I found, who I am 
There's no way to hold it in 
No more hiding who i wanna be 
This is me 

Do you know what it's like 
To feel so in the dark 
To dream about a life 
Where you're the shining star 
Even though it seems 
That get to far away 
I've got to believe in myself 
It's the only way 

This is real, this is me 
I'm exactly where I'm supposed to be 
Now let the light shine one me 
If I found, who I am 
There's no way to hold it in 
This Is Me / Gotta Find You lyrics on 
http://music.***/song/Movie-Game-Ads/39923-This-Is-Me~Demi-Lovato-Joe-Jonas.html 
No more hiding who I wanna be 
This is me 

Joe: 
You're the voice I hear inside my head 
The reason that I'm singing 
I need to find you 
I gotta find you 
You're the missing piece I need 
The song inside on me 
I need to find you 

Joe & Demi: 
I gotta find you 

This is real, this is me 
I'm exactly where I'm supposed to be 
Now let the light shine on me 
If I found, who I am 
There is no way to hold it in 
No more hiding who I wanna be 

Demi: 
(This is me 
This is me 
Yeah) 

Joe: 
You're the missing piece I need 
The song inside of me 
You're the voice I hear inside my head 
The reason that I'm singing 

Joe & Demi: 
And I've found 
Who I am 
There is no way to hold it in 
No more hiding who I wanna be 
This is me
