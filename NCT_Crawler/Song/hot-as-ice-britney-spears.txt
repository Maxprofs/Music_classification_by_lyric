Hot As Ice
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

I'm just a girl with the ability to drive a man crazy
Make him call me "mama," make him my new baby
A new way to prove they're saying "thank you very much"
Living legend
You can look, but don't touch

'Cause I'm cold as fire baby, hot as ice
If you've ever been to heaven, this is twice as nice
I'm cold as fire baby, hot as ice
If you've ever been to heaven, this is twice as nice
Break it down, break it down, break it down
Break it down, break it down, break it down

And handling my business
Holler if you hear me
Hey, can I get a witness
Preach it, preach it
I'm the teacher, you can learn
Watch your fingers, boy
You might get burned

'Cause I'm cold as fire baby, hot as ice
If you've ever been to heaven, this is twice as nice
I'm cold as fire baby, hot as ice
If you've ever been to heaven, this is twice as nice
Break it down, break it down, break it down
Break it down, break it down, break it down

As you can see, fortunately
I'm cold as fire
Yeah, I'm cold as fire
Yeah, make you believe
Make you stop and breathe
I'll take you higher

I'm just too cool
Make you do what it do
I'm hot as ice now
I'll make you feel like heaven 24/7
I'm twice as nice now

Cold as fire baby, hot as ice
If you've ever been to heaven, this is twice as nice
I'm cold as fire baby, hot as ice
If you've ever been to heaven, this is twice as nice

Break it down, break it down, break it down
Break it down, break it down, break it down

THE END OF THIS SONG...THE BEGINNING OF OUR LOVE AGAIN?...
