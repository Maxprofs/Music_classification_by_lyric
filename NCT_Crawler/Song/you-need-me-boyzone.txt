                        i cried a tear
you wiped it dry
i was confused
you cleared my mind
i sold my soul
you bought it back for me
and held the earth
you gave me dignity
somehow you needed me
you gave me strength
to stand alone again
to face the world
out on my own again
you put me high
upon a pedestal
so high that i could almost see eternity
you needed me
you needed me

i can't believe it's you
i can't believe it's you
i needed you
and you were there
and i'll never leave, why should i leave?
i needed you
i finally found someone who really cares

(you needed me)

you held my hand
it was cold
and i was lost
you took me home
you gave me love
that i was at the end
i turned my life
back into truth again you even called me 'friend'

you gave me strength
to stand alone again
to face the world
out on my own again
you put me high
upon a pedestal
so high that i could almost see eternity
you needed me
you needed me

you needed me
you needed me
oh, yes, you needed me
you needed me
