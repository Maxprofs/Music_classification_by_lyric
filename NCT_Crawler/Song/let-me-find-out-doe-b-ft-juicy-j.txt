                        This a Tennesse, Alabama, Atlanta connection homeboy Let me find out these niggas still hating on the low
 And their whole life savings I get paid for a show
 Their re-up, that's my walk-through
 My sneakers, there they house note
 Think I need a whole thang of Keisha just to talk to 'em
 Small town, big money, baby I make boss moves
 They say Doe B lane is like T-Pain without the auto-tune
 Bring out the Apollo boom
 I'mma sandman these niggas
 Give you 2 thumbs down
 Boy, your swag ain't official
 Let me find out them fake Guccis
 Let me find out them fake Louis
 Let me find out your baby mama is a man-eater, she ate my children
 Let me find out you fake juug and I come through like, "Aye buddy
 You 25, just started trapping?"
 Let me find out you straight rookie
 Taylor Gang, straight trippy
 Hustle Gang what it is, pimping?
 Got so many white friends I bring back Tommy Hilfiger
 A-T-L, let me find out
 Memphis Ten', let me find out
 M.I.A., N-Y-C, Texas, Cali, Chi-Town Let me find out
 Let me find out
 Nigga let me find out
 Let me find, out Let me find out
 Let me find out
 Nigga let me find out
 Let me find, out Let me find out & I'm ridin' out
 Got 4 choppers no 9's out
 I'm recent, you're timed out
 I'm playin' with it, you fouled out
 You got a foul mouth, you'll get 2 shots
 Nigga and one with my handgun
 Nigga talk about dough but that's something
 You ain't never had your hands on
 Got folk in Alabama, they still call me Arm & Hammer
 See I do it for the
 Gutter, not just to get the glamor
 Hey who that nigga from Atlanta say he got a lot of drugs?
 Say you looking
 For a plug, bitch you looking at the plug
 I'mma, real young nigga
 You want this ho, better come get her
 We don't want your bitch man
 We just wanna have fun with her
 Okay well let me find out you channeled it
 Ridin' around town just saving hoes
 Nigga she ain't all yours, we shared the bitch
 But let me find out
 She havin' your baby though Let me find out
 Let me find out
 Nigga let me find out
 Let me find out
 Let me find out (Let me find out, let me find out)
 Let me find out
 Nigga let me find out (Let me find out, let me find out)
 Bitch let me find out Let me find out, Juicy J's your girl's favorite rapper
 I'mma *** her all night and I'mma give her back after
 I ain't hand cuffing these hoes like shackles
 For the green & the cheese like a Green Bay packer
 Trippy Man, *** you pay me, I come play like Tom Brady
 Kush is my medication, ride presidential like Ronald Reagan
 Pussy niggas need to stop hating my flow sick like cancer patients
 Rolex and a new Bugatti, yes bitch I'm ice skating
 My last bitch must've been a chauffeur, she drove me crazy
 No key, that space age, my ignition, I done made it
 Juicy J, that's trippy ho, Taylor Gang that's trippy ho
 Smoking on that Christmas tree my belt buckle like mistletoe
 Who stands with your wife?
 She just spent the night
 With my dick in her mouth & my balls in her hand
 Like the bitch was shooting dice
 Juicy J, I got long money
 I got 1998 song money
 Bitch pour that Patron for me
 I rock shows, boy I'm stone money Let me find out (lemme find out you nigga isn't who you say you is)
 Let me find out (haha you niggas nobody man)
 Nigga let me find out
 (Lemme find out you sold your soul for them joint nigga)
 Let me find, out
 Bitch let me find out (let me find out let me find out)
 Let me find out
 Ya'll niggas might not let me find out
 Nigga let me find out (let me find out let me find out)
 Bitch let me find out (Ya'll niggas might not let me find out)
