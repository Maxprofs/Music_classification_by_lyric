                        Bài hát: Beautiful Girl - Nguyễn Thắng, Thái Foon

You'll have me suicidal, suicidal
When you say it's over

When the night has come, 
and the land is dark 
And the moon is the only 
light we will see 

I won't cry, I won't cry, 
no, I won't shed a tear 
Just as long as you stand, stand by me 

You're way too beautiful girl
That's why it'll never work
You'll have me suicidal, suicidal
When you say it's over

Damn all these beautiful girls
They only wanna do you dirt
They'll have you suicidal, suicidal
When they say it's over
                        
                    |
