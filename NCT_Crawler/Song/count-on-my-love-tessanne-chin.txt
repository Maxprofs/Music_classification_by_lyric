                        Never meant to up and disappear.
 Left my lipstick kiss on your mirror.
 You picked a fine time to disagree yea,
 I guess you like to never make it easy on me When you wait,
 And I'm gone
 Far way
 Don't you worry your heart
 When the loneliness calls out your name
 And you're falling apart (Don't you worry)
 Don't you worry, don't worry,
 Cause worries are just gonna make this hard.
 If you ever stop questioning us you can count on my love,
 Count on my love. Count on my love. When I act insecure, you get defensive.
 (Yea you know you do)
 But there is no need to be over protective.
 Oh no
 Even though it seems, I'm having the time of my life without you
 I'm the best I'll ever be when I'm with you.
 With you. When you wait,
 And I'm gone
 Far way
 Don't you worry your heart
 When the loneliness calls out your name
 And you're falling apart
 Don't you worry, don't worry,
 Cause worries are just gonna make this hard.
 If you ever stop questioning us you can count on my love,
 Count on my love. When you rise up inna the morning
 And you missing me my baby
 Hold onto the melody,
 Hold onto my memory.
 Nobody can hold a candle to your loving
 I'm your lady.
 We got history yea, forever and a day.
 And when the mountain start fi tremble
 and the sky dem start fi fall
 My love is eternal and will last throughout it all
 Gone too far to give up now
 You can count on my love now. When you wait,
 And I'm gone
 Far way
 Don't you worry your heart
 When the loneliness calls out your name
 And you're falling apart.
 Dont you worry, dont worry,
 Cause worries are just gonna make this hard.
 If you ever stop questioning us you can count on my love,
 Count on my love.
 Count on my love.
