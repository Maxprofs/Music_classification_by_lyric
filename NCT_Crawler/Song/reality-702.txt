                        You don't know what we go through
 So I'm singin' this song for you Ain't got no time to play around
 It ain't about just hangin' out
 I got so much more to do
 It ain't worth bein' with you Some people think they wanna live this life
 They see the fame but they don't know the price
 It ain't that easy, I need you to feel me
 Reality's of a star I'm staying focused on myself, hey
 Ain't gotta please nobody else, uh
 Got to do what's best for me
 That's the way it has to be, baby Some people think they wanna live this life
 They see the fame but they don't know the price
 It ain't that easy, I need you to feel me
 Reality's of a star You don't know what we go through
 So I'm singin' this song for you Some people think they wanna live this life
 They see the fame but they don't know the price
 It ain't that easy, I need you to feel me
 Reality's of a star More than west travellin'
 Go to school, I got my friends
 And family had a crave, it'll be okay
 Photo shoots, make up, video
 Is the truth, mostly missin' your men
