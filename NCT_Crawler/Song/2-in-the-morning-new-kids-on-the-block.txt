                        Tick tick tock tock
Tick tick tock tock
Tick tick

Wake up wake up
Wake up wake up

I know you musta had a long day
'Cause at 6 o'clock I heard you say
There was something that was on your mind
But you ain't told me and it's almost 9

Now it's 9 o'clock and I thought
We could talk but you ain't givin' in
Through this hoverin' girl, it's almost 10
I wanna know if you're mad at me, before Grey's Anatomy
'Cause we could drag this out all night

Until it's 2 in the morning
Girl, whatcha wanna do
Do you wanna fight, wanna say goodnight
If you tell me you want it
This could be over,

'Cause it's 2 in the morning
Girl, whatcha wanna do
Do you wanna fight, wanna say goodnight
If you tell me you want it
This could be over,

The lights are out,
Don't wanna wake you, so I'm creepin' in
I know you're hurt
'Cause baby you're not sleepin' in
My favorite pair of boxers
That you make look so hot, girl
You're playin' sleep but I know you're not, girl

And now it's 12 o'clock
And I thought I should talk
But you're not listenin'
Here we go again
You know I like it when
You got your back to me

But not when you're mad at me
Please look at me and say goodnight, girl

It's 2 in the morning
(It's 2 in the morning)
Girl, whatcha wanna do
Do you wanna fight, wanna say goodnight
If you tell me you want it
This could be over

'Cause it's 2 in the morning
Wake up, girl, whatcha wanna do
Do you wanna fight
Wanna say goodnight
If you tell me you want it,
This could be over

This could be over
I wanna come over
Baby, turn over

Girl, Ima lay up all night
Just waiting for your kiss good-night
Even if you're mad at me
You know we shouldn't go to bed angry

Now it's 2 in the morning
Girl, whatcha want to do
Do you wanna fight, wanna say goodnight
If you tell me you want it
This could be over

'Cause it's 2 in the morning
Girl, whatcha wanna do
Do you wanna fight, wanna say good-night
If you tell me you want it
This could be over

We can work it out (wake up, wake up)
We can work it out (get up, get up)
We can work it out
I wanna come over

We can work it out (wake up, wake up)
We can work it out (get up, get up)
We can work it out
I wanna come over
