                        Bài hát: Hello (Rock Cover) - Nightcore

Hello, it's me
I was wondering if after all these years you'd like to meet

To go over everything
They say that time's supposed to heal ya
But I ain't done much healing

Hello, can you hear me?
I'm in California dreaming about who we used to be
When we were younger and free

I've forgotten how it felt
Before the world fell at our feet
There's such a difference between us
And a million miles

[Đk:]
Hello from the other side
I must have called a thousand times
To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done
But when I call you never seem to be home

Hello from the outside
At least I can say that I've tried
To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart
But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart
Anymore

I've got fire for a heart
Im not scared of the dark
You've never seen it look so easy
I got a river for a soul

And baby you're a boat
Baby you're my only reason
If I didn't have you there would be nothing left 
The shell of a man who could never be his best

 If I didn't have you ,I'd never see the sun
You taught me how to be some one,Yeah
All my life
You stood by me 

When no one else was never behind me 
Al these lights
They can't blind me 
With your love,nobody can drag me down

So hello from the other side (other side)
I must have called a thousand times (thousand times)
To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done
But when I call you never seem to be home

[Đk:]
Hello from the outside (outside)
At least I can say that I've tried (I've tried)
To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart
But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart
Anymore

(Now,I'm free)
(Free falling)
(Cause I'm free)
(Free falling)

[Đk:]
So hello from the other side (other side)
I must have called a thousand times (thousand times)
To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done
But when I call you never seem to be home

Hello from the outside (outside)
At least I can say that I've tried (I've tried)
To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart
But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart
Anymore

Hello from the other side (other side)
I must have called a thousand times (thousand times)
To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done
But when I call you never seem to be home
                        
                    |
