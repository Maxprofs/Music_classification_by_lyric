                        Hi dear, what's on tonight
 Let's stay up and watch the tube
 And bask in the big blue light
 Bye bye real life, checking into checking out
 It's saturation time Perfect faces, perfect background, perfect everything I wanna live in a dream that is never ending
 I wanna love all the wasted time I'm spending
 Tonight I can take it all the way
 Because tonight, I'm everything I wanted to be Well dear, it's a good thing
 I don't have to look at you
 And you don't have to look at me
 I think that's a good thing We're perfect strangers, perfect ohh, perfect everything I wanna live in a dream that is never ending
 I wanna love all the wasted time I'm spending
 Tonight I can take it all the way
 Because tonight, I'm everything I wanted to be I wanna live, I wanna live I wanna live in a dream that is never ending
 Tonight I can take it good
 I wanna love all the wasted time I'm spending
 Tonight I can take it all the way
 Because tonight, I'm everything I wanted to be I wanna live in a dream that is never ending, ooh
 I wanna love all the wasted time I'm spending
 Tonight I can take it all the way I wanna live in a dream that is never ending
 I wanna love all the wasted time I'm spending
 Tonight I can take it all the way I wanna live in a dream that is never ending
 I wanna love all the wasted time I'm spending I wanna live in a dream that is never ending
 I wanna love all the wasted time I'm spending
 I wanna live in a dream that is never ending
