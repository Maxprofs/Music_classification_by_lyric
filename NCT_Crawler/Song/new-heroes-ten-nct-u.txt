                        Bài hát: New Heroes - Ten (NCT U)

Nobody knows how I got here
Nobody cared for my dream
I get high off my lows
and stronger from the blows
So I keep on keep on keep on
All of the pains
Taste of the sweat and dirt
We all live for the day
They’ll be screaming our names
So we keep on keep on keep on
We’re the new heroes oh
We’re the new heroes oh
We’re the new heroes oh
Heroes
Fought off the wolves
in sheep clothing
Stood up for what I believed
Turn my mess into messages
Learn from the lessons
And keep on keep on keep on
Through all of the fears
Taste of the sweat and dirt
We all live for the day
They’ll be screaming our names
So we keep on keep on keep on
We’re the new heroes oh
We’re the new heroes oh
We’re the new heroes oh
Heroes
Burning through nights
Paying the price
To be living legends
All of the breaks
Every stage
To be living legends
We’re the new heroes
The future
The new heroes
