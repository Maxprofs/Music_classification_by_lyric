                        Bài hát: Diamond - Martina McBride, Keith Urban

As solid as a rock
Priceless as they come
Raised out of the dust
You're tender and you're tough
Just shinin' in the sun
Brilliant under pressure
Sharper than a knife
A not so hidden treasure
Deserve to hear forever
Who's holding you tonight
Baby you're a diamond
You're always gonna cut through
You just go on shinin'
Baby you're a diamond
They're never gonna break you
Love might let you down
Leave you lyin' in the dark
Those teardrops on your face
Ain't ever going to change
How beautiful you are
'cause baby you're a diamond
You're always gonna cut through
You just go on shinin'
'cause baby you're a diamond
They're never gonna break you
Yeah, never gonna break you
Ooh, yeah
Girl you know I know you
I've seen you through it all
Remember that you're worth it
You're perfectly, imperfect even with a couple flaws
'cause that's the thing about a diamond
You're always gonna cut through
You just go on shinin'
Baby you're a diamond
They're never gonna break you
'cause baby you're a diamond, yes you are
You're always going to cut through
You just go on shinin'
'cause baby you're a diamond
They're never gonna break you
They're never gonna break you
