Hey, are you there? 
I keep reaching out for you 
I keep tryina call, but my signal won't get through 
Ready now, it's time to find you, 
Send an SOS to guide you, 
Even wrote a message in a bottle for you 
When the road looks unfamiliar, 
When the sky is roaring at ya 
There's only one thing to do 

Shall I collide in the dark 
Illuminate the way to my heart 
Follow the stars in the sky 
They're leading you HOME! 
'Cause it's time to come HOME HOME HOME 
Won't you hurry back HOME HOME HOME? 
I need you back HOME HOME HOME, 
'Cause it's where you belong! 

Look to the sky, 
You will see my calling sign 
Soon you'll be safe 
Wrapped up in these arms of mine 
Like the ocean meets the river, 
We'll float right back together 
No one can take away the love that we've had 
Let the beam of light once guide you, 
It's okay, leave the past behind you, 
There's only one thing to do! 

Shall I collide in the dark, 
Illuminate the way to my heart? 
Follow the stars in the sky 
They're leading you HOME! 
'Cause it's time to come HOME HOME HOME 
Won't you hurry back HOME HOME HOME? 
I need you back HOME HOME HOME, 
'Cause it's where you belong! 

Like a God that cannot be guide 
We'll always come back if we like it or not, 
To the place we call HOME 
Don't you know this is where we belong! 
Shall I collide in the dark, 
Illuminate the way to my heart? 
Follow the stars in the sky 
They're leading you HOME! 
'Cause it's time to come HOME HOME HOME 
Won't you hurry back HOME HOME HOME? 
I need you back HOME HOME HOME, 
'Cause it's where you belong! 
'Cause it's time to come HOME HOME HOME 
Won't you hurry back HOME HOME HOME? 
I need you back HOME HOME HOME, 
'Cause it's where you belong!
                        
                    |
