                        If I listen long enough to you

 I'd find a way to believe that it's all true

 Knowing that you lied straight-faced

 While I cried

 (*) And still I look

 To find a reason to believe

 Someone like you makes it hard to live

 Without somebody else

 Someone like you makes it easy to give

 Never thinking of myself

 If you took the time to change my mind

 I'd find a way

 To leave the past behind

 Knowing that you lied straight-faced

 While I cried

 Repeat (*)

 If I listen long enough to you

 I'd find the way to believe that it's all true

 Knowing that you lied straight-faced

 While I cried

 Repeat (*)
