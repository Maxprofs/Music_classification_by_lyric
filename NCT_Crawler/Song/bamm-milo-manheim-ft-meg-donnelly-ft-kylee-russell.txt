                        Bài hát: Bamm - Milo Manheim, Meg Donnelly, Kylee Russell

Hey, welcome to Zombieland
It's a party go ahead
Everybody dance
Do the draggy leg
You surely can be part of the team
Gotta wave the flag let your freak flag fly

Gotta stare when we pass by
Not your average guy
But you know I'm fly
So alive just on a different side
Look in my eyes

We're the same but different
Just like you I got hopes and wishes
Itchin' to show the world what they're missing
It's our time, yeah, it's time to flip it what
I'm about to show you
What you gon' show me?
Guess nobody told you
You ain't gotta tell me

I'm about to put in work
Listen this is my turf
Bamm! Oh man, oh man, I'm the man
Bet ya can't do it like I can
Bamm! Oh man, oh man, you a fan
Understand this is Zombieland
Bamm! Oh man, oh man, I'm the man

Bet ya can't do it like I can
Bamm! Oh man, oh man, I'm the man with the plan
Lemme do my dance, Bamm (Bamm)
You're in Zombieland (What)
I'm in Zombieland (What)
We're in Zombieland
Watch me do it like Bamm (Bamm)
You're in Zombieland (What)

I'm in Zombieland (What)
We're in Zombieland
Watch me do it like Bamm
Oh, oh, oh
Man, oh man, oh man
I'm the man
You just can't do it like
I can, I can

Oh, oh, oh
Man, oh man, oh man
I'm the man
You just can't do it like
I can
Ready for action, yeah, we're 'bout to blow up
Party's going down

But we're about to go up
We got your back
No need to have worries
Now we're all cool at first it was scurry
And we can do a lot with a little
Call on your friends when you're caught in the middle

And you should do the same like I do the same
You should be yourself, it's the coolest thang
I'm about to show you
What you gon' show me?
Guess nobody told you
Girl, you don't know me

I'm about to put in work
Listen this is our turf
Bamm! Oh man, oh man, I'm the man
Bet ya can't do it like I can
Bamm! Oh man, oh man, you a fan
Understand this is Zombieland
Bamm! Oh man, oh man, I'm the man

Bet ya can't do it like I can
Bamm! Oh man, oh man, I'm the man with the plan
Lemme do my dance, Bamm
You're in Zombieland (What)
I'm in Zombieland (what)
We're in Zombieland
Watch me do it like, Bamm (Bamm)

You're in Zombieland (What)
I'm in Zombieland (What)
We're in Zombieland
Watch me do it like Bamm
Bamm! Oh man, oh man, I'm the man
Bet ya can't do it like I can
Bamm! Oh man, oh man, you a fan

Understand this is Zombieland
Bamm! Oh man, oh man, I'm the man
Bet ya can't do it like I can
Bamm! Oh man, oh man, I'm the man with the plan
Understand this is Zombieland
Bamm! Oh man, oh man, I'm the man

Bet ya can't do it like I can
Bamm! Oh man, oh man, you a fan
Understand this is Zombieland
Bamm! Oh man, oh man, I'm the man
Bet ya can't do it like I can
Bamm! Oh man, oh man, I'm the man with the plan
