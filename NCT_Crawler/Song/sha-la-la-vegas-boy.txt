                        There's a boy on my mind and he knows I'm thinking of him
On my way through the day and the night the star shine above me
He's been gone for some time but I know I truly love him
And I'm singing a song hoping he'll be back
When he hears it.

My heart goes sha la la la la
Sha la la in the morning
Sha la la la la sha la la in the sunshine
Sha la la la la sha la la in the evening
Sha la la la la sha la la la just for you.

If your love's gone away just like mine
You'll fell like crying
Sing along maybe once maybe twice
Let's try it together
Some sweet day no one knows you'll return
And you'll be happy
Shout it l,sweet in a song listen to your heart
It is singing.

My heart goes sha la la la la
Sha la la in the morning
Sha la la la la sha la la in the sunshine
Sha la la la la sha la la in the evening
Sha la la la la sha la la la just for you.

My heart goes sha la la la la
Sha la la in the morning
Sha la la la la sha la la in the sunshine
Sha la la la la sha la la in the evening
Sha la la la la sha la la la just for you
Sha la la la la sha la la la just for you.
