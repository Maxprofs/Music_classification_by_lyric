                        [ti:No one else comes close]
[ar:Backstreet Boys]
No one else comes close
When we turn off the lights
The two of us alone together
Somethings just not right
But girl you know that i'd never ever
Let another's touth come between the two of us
Cause no one else could never take your place
No one else comes close to you
No one makes me feel the way you do
You're so special girl to me
And you'll always be eternally
Everytime i hold you near
You always say the words i love to hear
Girl with just a touth you can do so much
Oh girl no one else comes close
Oh......
And when i wake up to
The touth of your head on my shoulder
You're my dream come ture
Oh girl you know i'll always theasure
Every kiss everyday love you girl in everyway
And i always will cause in my eyes (oh baby)
