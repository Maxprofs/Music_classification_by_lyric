                        Bài hát: Safe And Sound - Different Heaven

Fill me up, with your smile
Like the sunshine brings the light,
Fill me up, with a flame,
I will let you win this game. 
Take me up, when I'm down,
'Cause with you I'm safe and sound
I'm safe and sound (x8)

BRING-BRING-BRING THAT BEAT BACK
O-O-O-OH YES!

Fill me up, with your smile
Like the sunshine brings the light,
Fill me up, with a flame,
I will let you win this game. 
Take me up, when I'm down,
'Cause with you I'm safe and sound
I'm safe and sound (x8)

BRING-BRING-BRING-BRING THAT BEAT

I'm safe and sound (x8)
                        
                    |
