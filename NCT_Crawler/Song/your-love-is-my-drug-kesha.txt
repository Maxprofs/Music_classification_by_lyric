Ke$ha - Your Love Is My Drug

Maybe i need some rehab
Or maybe just need some sleep
I got a sick obsession
Im seein it in my dreams
Im lookin down every alley
Im makin those desperate calls
Im stayin up all night hopen in my eye

What you got boy, is hard to find
I think about it all the time
Im all strung out my heart is fried
I just cant get you off my mind!

Because your love your love your love is my drug
Your love your love your love
Your love your love your love is my drug
Your love your love your love

Wont listen to any advice
Mummas tellin me i should think twice
But look into my own devices, im addicted its a crisis
My friends think ive gone crazy
My judgements gettin kinda hazy
Myspace is gonna be affected if i keep it up like a love sick crack head

What you got boy, is hard to find
I think about it all the time
Im all strung out my heart is fried
I just cant get you off my mind!

Because your love your love your love is my drug
Your love your love your love
Your love your love your love is my drug
Your love your love your love

I dont care what people say
The rush is worth the price i pay
I get so high when your with me
But crash and crave you when you leave

Hey, so i got a question
Do you wanna have a slumber party in my basement?
Do i make your heart beat like an 808 drum
Is my love your drug? your drug?
Hi, your drug?
Hi, your drug?
Is my love your drug?

Because your love your love your love is my drug
Your love your love your love
Your love your love your love is my drug
Your love your love your love

Because your love your love your love is my drug
Your love your love your love
Your love your love your love is my drug
Your love your love your love

Hey, heyy, sooo
You love, your love your love, is my drug
