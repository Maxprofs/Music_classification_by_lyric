                        Out On The Road
Norah Jones

I never wanted to be taken
But now I'm feeling so left out
So I don't care where I go
I'm leaving
Yeah I'm leaving

Got about a half a tank left
That could do but only if I'm lucky
But either way
I'm leaving
Oh I'm leaving
On my way to paradise
A little voice says don't think twice
And don't look back if you want things to change

Ah ah
Guess I'll have to love you from afar
Ah
It's okay cause all I need's my car
Out on the road out on the road

Out on the road out on the road oh oh I go
Out on the road out on the road

Out on the road out on the road

Takes about a week to get there
Maybe two if I stop to sleep it off
But I can't sleep so I'm leaving
Yeah I'm leaving
Keep on driving through the night
I find myself a slice of life
To show me that I'm heading the right way

Ah ah
Guess you'll have to love me from afar
Ah
It's okay cause all I need's this car
Out on the road out on the road

Out on the road out on the road oh oh I go
Out on the road out on the road

Out on the road out on the road oh oh I go
Out on the road out on the road

Out on the road out on the road
