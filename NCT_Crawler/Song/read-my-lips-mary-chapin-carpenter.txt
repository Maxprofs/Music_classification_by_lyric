                        A few more cigarettes now honey
 One more jolt of Joe
 A couple hours past New York city
 A few more turnpike tolls One more minute away from you
 Is a minute that lasts too long
 When I get back we're gonna lock the door baby
 Disconnect the phone We could use a week to get reacquainted
 Some time to feel it out
 But leave your small talk back at home baby
 This ain't what that's about Just read my lips
 Yes I think you can
 Just read my lips
 And you'll understand Well I can see it in your eyes now honey
 'Cause I've seen it in myself
 You've got a few old scars that's ancient history
 Baby that was someone else Well I could tell you that you're only human
 That you're right to be afraid
 But how can you pull back on me now
 Don't you make that big mistake Well you could give it up
 Or you could just give in
 Now it's a choice between the two
 You aren't born no yesterday baby
 I wasn't born a fool Just read my lips
 Yes I think you can
 Just read my lips
 And you'll understand Just read my lips
 And you can read my mind
 Just read my lips
 Just one more time This ain't no game of cat and mouse
 It ain't no truth or dare
 I ain't got 20 questions for you
 Just one thing to declare Just read my lips
 Yes I think you can
 Just read my lips
 And you'll understand Baby read my lips
 And you can read my mind
 Just read my lips baby
 One more time, oh
                        
                    |
