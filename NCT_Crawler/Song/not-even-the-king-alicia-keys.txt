                        Title: Not Even The King
Artist: Alicia Keys

Money
Some people so poor
All that they got is money

Oooh And diamonds
Some people waste their life conting their thaosands
I don't care they're offering
How much gold they bring
They can't afford what we had
Not even a king
They can't afford what we got
Not even a king

Oooh Castles
Some people so lonely what good is a castle
Surrounded by people 
But ain't got a friend thats not on a payroll
I don't care what they bring
They can have everything
They can't afford what we got
Not even a king
They can't afford what we got
Not even a king

All the king's horses and all the king's men
Came charging to get what we got
They offer the crown and they offer the throne
I already got all that i want
All the king's horses and all the king's men
They came marchin through
They offer the world just to have what we got
But i found a world in you
i found a world in you

So darling listen
Your arms around me worth more than a kingdom
Yeaaah Believe that 
The trust that we feel the king never felt that
Yeaaah This is a song we sing
we don't need anything
They cant afford this 
This is priceless
They can't afford what we got
Not even a king
They can't afford what we got
Not even a king
