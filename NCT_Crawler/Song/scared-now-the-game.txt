                        [Hook:]

 Who the *** scared now?
 Look who the *** there now
 Had to hit him with the shotty nigga
 Another dead ***ing body nigga

 Gansters, it's just how we roll
 Jesus Piece, and it's out of gold
 Versace polo and a pound of dro
 Hop in that ghost, and it's adios

 Who the *** scared now?
 Who the *** scared now?

 [Verse:]
 Chased that nigga down, put him on worldstar
 Bitch nigga got away, in his girl's car
 Put that pussy on the net like a pornstar
 Another weenie with bread, he a corndog

 Put 3 holes in his head, like a bowling ball
 I'm out the gutter switching lanes in a stolen car
 *** the feds, cause a nigga got a murder charge
 *** it though, I made the cover of the murder dog

 Dress up like the pizza man, load the desert eagle and
 I don't just hit ya team, I wet the whole bleachers. Damn
 Specialize in the murder game
 Documentary ***, back to Hurricane

 Tell a nigga

 [Hook:]

 [Verse 2:]

 I'm the most feared rap nigga
 Like a Just Blaze beat, I'll clap niggas
 This ain't a Just Blaze beat, this ain't rap nigga
 Voletta Wallace lost her son to a gat nigga

 What if I told y'all I know who killed Biggie dog?
 I ain't no snitch but if I did it ain't no Biggie dog
 Cause that's Biggie dog
 All that's coming out the mouth of the nigga you used to know as being 50's dog
 But I got tired of being 50's dog
 Had to break my chain and cut that nigga 50 off

 Whole team celebrating, label on my dick hard
 Interscope asking "would I take 50's call"
 Hello? Put up 10 mill for a real nigga
 Drop this joint album and we'll kill niggas

 [Hook:]

 [Verse 3:]

 Meek Mill:

 Meek Milly

 All these niggas claiming they og, my young boy's will murder them
 Cold shooters, that 16, and they ain't ever even hear of them
 I slide through, I get a bird of them
 And they drive through, and they serving them
 These niggas talking that beef ***, I put bread on it, no burger bun

 We walk up in this bitch like "what?"
 Rollie on my wrist lights up
 Told these niggas "can't do it like us"
 Ciroc boy, and I do it like Puff

 With 100 bottles, 100 models
 No twitter, we come to follow
 Straight shots and no moscato
 I *** them hoes, don't give a *** bout em

 Now tell me who's scared now?
 Shots fired, man down
 Dead bodies get found
 That chopper clip spits rounds
 And real niggas get murdered
 Top dogs get it first
 He came to me in that benz, and he left from here in a herse
 Woah!
