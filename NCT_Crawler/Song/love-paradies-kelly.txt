                        You're always on my mind, all days and all the time.
You're every thing to me, bright the stars to let me see.
You touch me in my dreams, we kiss in every scenes. 
I pray to be with you through rainy, shine day.

I love you till I die, deep as sea, wide as sky. 
The beauty of our love paints rainbows every where we go. 
I need you all my life, you're my hope, you're my pride. 
In your arms I find my heaven. In your eyes my sea is sky. 
My love is all love paradise
