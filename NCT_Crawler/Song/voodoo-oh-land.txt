                        You changed your silhouette
 You cast another shadow
 You're speaking like scissors
 Cutting out a foreign pattern All the things you do
 Affecting my behavior
 No doctors got me diagnosed
 No science proves a safe cure It's voodoo you do
 There's needles everywhere
 It's voodoo you do
 There is fire in the air
 All the noise will disappear It's voodoo you do
 There's needles everywhere
 It's voodoo you do
 I go higher in the air
 I'm possessed when you are near I love the color red
 It is for love, it is for death It is my ritual
 I see it as my duty
 Seduction is an art
 You can see through all the beauty I know you wonder why
 I'm so afraid of learning
 If I give in to you
 There is no returning It's voodoo you do
 There's needles everywhere
 It's voodoo you do
 There is fire in the air
 All the noise will disappear It's voodoo you do
 There's needles everywhere
 It's voodoo you do
 I go higher in the air
 I'm possessed when you are near Ooh, electrodes
 Disturbing the activity
 In my brain
 Just a few more diodes connected And the smiles are coming back
 Again, again, again
 Ooh, electrodes connecting
 And tuning you in I love the color red
 It is for love, it is for Voodoo, there's needles everywhere
 It's voodoo you do
 There is fire in the air
 All the noise will disappear It's voodoo you do
 There's needles everywhere
 It's voodoo you do
 I go higher in the air
 I'm possessed when you get near There's needles everywhere
 There's needles everywhere
 There's needles everywhere
 There's needles everywhere There's needles everywhere
 There's needles everywhere
 There's needles everywhere
 There's needles everywhere
