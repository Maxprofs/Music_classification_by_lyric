Modern Talking() — Ready for the Victory



Ready for the Victory
You're in our hearts
Just from round to round
You will be the champion
The king without a crown
Like a fireball
You'll never never give up
Hear the engine call
Waiting for the start
Can't you see
We're ready for the victory
It's clear
You're the hero just for you and me
I feel
We're in the pole-position-team
Can't you see it's like a dream?
From Australia to USA
And From Italy to Germany
And From San Marino to Canada
He is our biggest star
Oh you cannot loose
If you have a lucky hand
You will be the hero
You have many friends
Dreams we cannot buy
You will win again
Nobody does it better
Through passion and through pain
Can't you see
We're ready for the victory
It's clear
You're the hero just for you and me
I feel
We're in the pole-position-team
Can't you see it's like a dream?
From Australia to USA
And From Italy to Germany
And From San Marino to Canada
He is our biggest star
We're ready for the victory
You're the hero just for you and me
We're in the pole-position-team
Can't you see it's like a dream?
From Australia to USA
And From Italy to Germany
And From San Marino to Canada
He is our biggest star
We're ready for the victory!
