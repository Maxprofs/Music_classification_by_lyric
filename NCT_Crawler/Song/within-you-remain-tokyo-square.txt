                        Bài hát: Within You Remain - Tokyo Square

Facing the world with an empty heart
I could disappear into the dark

And you were the one
Who could make my dreams come true
My dear it's you

When you're not around
My heart stood still
Within you'll remain
And always will

Illusions say there is another man
Who would interfere into my plans

Wo ai ni, I love you
Wo ai ni, I need you
More than I ever did anyone
I never felt like this before

Wo ai ni I want you
Wo ai ni I need you
We could be two lovers from the past
And the future is our chance

When you're not around
My heart stood still
Within you'll remain
And always will

Wo ai ni I love you
 Wo ai ni, I need you
More than I ever did anyone
I never felt like this before

Wo ai ni I want you
Wo ai ni I need you
We could be two lovers from the past
And the future is our chance
                        
                    |
