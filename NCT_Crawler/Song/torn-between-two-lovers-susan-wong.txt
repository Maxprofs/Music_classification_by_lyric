                        Bài hát : Torn Between Two Lovers - Susan Wong

There are times when a woman has to say what's on her mind
Even though she knows
How much it's gonna hurt
Before I say another word
Let me tell you I love you
Let me hold you close
And say these words as gently as I can
There's been another man
That I've needed and I've loved
But that doesn't mean I love you less
And he knows you can't possess me
And he knows he never will
There's just this empty place inside of me
That only he can fill
Torn between two lovers, feelin' like a fool
Lovin' both of you is breakin' all the rules
Torn between two lovers, feelin' like a fool
Lovin' you both is breakin' all the rules
You mustn't think you've failed me
Just because there's someone else
You were the first real love I ever had
And all the things I ever said,
I swear they still are true
For no one else
Can have the part of me I gave to you
Torn between two lovers, feelin' like a fool
Lovin' both of you is breakin' all the rules
Torn between two lovers, feelin' like a fool
Lovin' both of you is breakin' all the rules
I couldn't really blame you
If you turned and walked away
But with everything I feel inside,
I'm asking you to stay
Torn between two lovers Feelin' like a fool
Lovin' both of you is breakin' all the rules
Torn between two lovers, feelin' like a fool
Lovin' both of you is breakin' all the rules
Torn between two lovers, feelin' like a fool
Lovin' you both is breakin' all the rules
Torn between two lovers Feelin' like a fool
Lovin' both of you is breakin' all the rules
Torn between two lovers, feelin' like a fool
                        
                    |
