                        Song: Ring My Bells - Enrique Iglesias

Ring my bell, ring my bells
Ring my bell, ring my bells
Ring my bell, ring my bells
Ring my bell, ring my bells

Sometimes you love it, sometimes you dont
Sometimes you need it then you dont and you let go
Sometimes we rush it, sometimes we fall
It doesnt matter baby we can take it real slow

Cause the way that we touch is something that we cant deny
And the way that you move oh, you make me feel alive
Now come on

Ring my bell, ring my bells
Ring my bell, ring my bells

You try to hide it, I know you do
When all you really want is me to come and get you
You move in closer, I feel you breathe
Its like the world just disappears when you're around me, oh

Cause the way that we touch is something that we cant deny, oh yeah
And the way that you move, oh you make me feel alive
So come on

Ring my bell, ring my bells
Ring my bell, ring my bells
Ring my bell, ring my bells
Ring my bell, ring my bells

I say you want, I say you need
I can tell by your face you love the way it turns me on
I say you want, I say you need
I will do all the things that I would never do, you're wrong

Cause the way that we love is something that we cant fight, oh no
I just cant get enough, oh you make me feel alive
So come on

Ring my bell, ring my bells
Ring my bell, ring my bells

I say you want, I say you need
(Ring my bell, ring my bells)
(I can tell by the way you're looking at me)
(Ring my bell, ring my bells)
(I turn you on)
(Ring my bell, ring my bells)

I say you want, I say you need
(Ring my bell, ring my bells)
(If you got what it takes we don't have to wait)
(Ring my bell, ring my bells)
(Let's get it on)
(Ring my bell, ring my bells)
Get it on!

Ring my bell, ring my bells
Ring my bell, ring my bells
