                        Bài hát : Mr. President - Pia Mia

Doctor, I need medicine
Cheerleader need her letterman
Yeah, knock knock, let me in
Give you a late show like Letterman
I'm right here boy, what you doing 'bout it?
Step up...do without it
I'll be waiting, anticipating

I got you going 90 on the highway
Rolling up to my driveway
See the look on my face
I'm not the girl next door

You should already know
How this thing 'bout to go
You should already know
Thought that I told you
When you came over
You should already know
I need a soldier

Hey there, Mr. President
I could be your Marilyn
Yeah, tryna talk, I ain't hearing it
And what I got, I ain't sharing it
It's for you boy, what you doing 'bout it?
Step up...do without it
I'll be waiting, anticipating

I got you going 90 on the highway
Rolling up to my driveway
See the look on my face
I'm not the girl next door

You should already know
How this thing 'bout to go
You should already know
Thought that I told you
When you came over
You should already know
I need a soldier

I don't want no one but you
Oh baby, baby

You should already know
How this thing 'bout to go
You should already know
Thought that I told you
When you came over
You should already know
I need a soldier
                        
                    |
