                        WITH OR WITHOUT YOU 

( U2 ) 

See the stone set in your eyes 
See the thorn twist in your side 

I wait for you 
Sleight of hand and twist of fate 
On a bed of nails she makes me wait 
And I wait...without you 

With Or Without You 
With Or Without You 

Through the storm we reach the shore 
You give it all but I want more 
And I'm waiting for you 

With Or Without You 
With Or Without You 
I can't live 
With Or Without You 

And you give yourself away 
And you give yourself away 
And you give 
And you give 
And you give yourself away 

My hands are tied 
My body bruised, she's got me with 
Nothing to win 
And nothing left to lose 

And you give yourself away 
And you give yourself away 
And you give 
And you give 
And you give yourself away 

With Or Without You 
With Or Without You 
I can't live 
With Or Without You 

With Or Without You 
With Or Without You 
I can't live 
With Or Without You
                        
                    |
