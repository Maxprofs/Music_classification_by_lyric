                        Bài hát: NO (Meghan Trainor Cover) - Pentatonix

I think it's so cute and I think it's so sweet 
How you let your friends encourage you to try and talk to me 
But let me stop you there, oh, before you speak 

Nah to the ah to the no, no, no 
My name is no 
My sign is no 
My number is no 
You need to let it go 
You need to let it go 
Need to let it go 
Nah to the ah to the no, no, no 
My name is no 
My sign is no 
My number is no 
You need to let it go 
You need to let it go 
Need to let it go 
Nah to the ah to the no, no, no 

First you gonna say you ain't runnin' game, thinkin' I'm believing every word 
Call me beautiful, so original, telling me I'm not like other girls 
I was in my zone before you came along, now I'm thinking maybe you should go 
Blah, blah, blah, I be like nah to the ah to the no, no, no 

All my ladies, listen up 
If that boy ain't giving up 
Lick your lips and swing your hips 
Girl all you gotta say is 

My name is no 
My sign is no 
My number is no 
You need to let it go 
You need to let it go 
Need to let it go 
Nah to the ah to the no, no, no 
My name is no 
My sign is no 
My number is no 
You need to let it go 
You need to let it go 
Need to let it go 
Nah to the ah to the no, no, no 

Thank you in advance, I don't wanna dance (nope) 
I don't need your hands all over me 
If I want a man, then I'mma get a man 
But it's never my priority 
I was in my zone, before you came along, don't want you to take this personal 
Blah, blah, blah, I be like nah to the ah to the no, no, no 

All my ladies, listen up 
If that boy ain't giving up 
Lick your lips and swing your hips 
Girl all you gotta say is 

My name is no 
My sign is no 
My number is no 
You need to let it go 
You need to let it go 
Need to let it go 
Nah to the ah to the no, no, no 
My name is no 
My sign is no 
My number is no 
You need to let it go 
You need to let it go 
Need to let it go 
Nah to the ah to the no, no, no

Untouchable, untouchable
