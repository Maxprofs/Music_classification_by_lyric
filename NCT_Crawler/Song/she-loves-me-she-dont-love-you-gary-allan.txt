                        Song: She Loves Me (She Don'T Love You) - Gary Allan

Well, I can see you're dancing every dance with her
And it seems to me you're dancing much too close to her
When you're sitting at our table you're sitting next to her
But my heart knows that it's true that she loves me, she don't love you

Well let me tell you friend I'm wise to your lies
Even telling me that I'm the guy for her
And every little thing that you do and say
Has given me the way you're in love with her

Well just one more dance with her
And friend you're gonna see
What it's like to hit the floor
And do a little dance with me
So here's your coat and here's your hat
I think you'd better leave
'Cause she just told me it's true
She loves me, she don't love you

Well let me tell you friend I'm wise to your lies
Even telling me that I'm the guy for her
And every little thing that you do and say
Has given me the way you're in love with her

Well just one more dance with her
And friend you're gonna see
What it's like to hit the floor
And do a little dance with me
So here's your coat and here's your hat
I think you'd better leave
'Cause she just told me it's true
She loves me, she don't love you

So here's your coat and here's your hat
I think you'd better leave
'Cause she just told me it's true
She loves me, she don't love you
