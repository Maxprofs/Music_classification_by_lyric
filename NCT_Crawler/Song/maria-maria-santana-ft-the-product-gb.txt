turn up your sound system to the
sound of carlos santana and the GMB
(Surprada)
Ghe tto people- from the Refugee Gang

oh Maria Maria
She reminds me of a west side story
Growing up in Spanish Harlem
She living the life just like a movie star


oh Maria Maria
She fell in love in East L.A.
To the sounds of the guitar, yea ,yea
Played by Carlos Santana


Stop the looting, stop the shooting
Pick pocking on the corner
See as the rich is getting richer
The poorer is getting poorer


See mi y Maria on the corner
Thinking of ways to make it better
In my mailbox there's an eviction letter
Somebody just said see you later


Ahora vengo mama chula mama chula
Ahora vengo mama chula (east coast)


Ahora vengo mama chula mama chula
Ahora vengo mama chula (west coast )

oh Maria Maria
She reminds me of a west side story
Growing up in Spanish Harlem
She's living the life just like a movie star


oh Maria Maria
She fell in love in East L.A.
To the sounds of the guitar,
Played by Carlos Santana

I said a la fella los colores
The streets are getting hotter
There is no water to put out the fire
Mi cosa la esperanza


Se mira Maria on the corner
Thinking of ways to make it better
Then I looked up in the sky
Hoping of days of paradise
                        
                    |
