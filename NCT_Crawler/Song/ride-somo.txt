Take off those heels 
Lay on my bed 
Whisper dirty secrets while i am pulling on your hair 
Poison in our veins, but we don't even care 
Candles dripping on your body 
Baby this ain't truth or dare 

Everybody wonders, where we've run off to. 
My body on your body, baby, sticking like some glue. 
Naughty, let's get naughty, girl it's only one or two. 
Fevers *** running, feel the heat between us two. 

I'm gonna ride, I'm gonna ride, 
I'm gonna ride, I'm, I'm gonna ride. 
On you baby, on you lady.. all night, all, all night. 
I'm gonna take care of your body, 
I'll be gentle don't you scream. 
It's getting hotter, make it softer, feel your chest on top of me. 

I'm gonna ride, I'm gonna ride, 
I'm gonna ride, I'm, I'm gonna ride. 
On you baby, on you lady.. all night, all, all night. 
I'm gonna make you feel that loving, getting weak all in your knees. 
Kiss your body from the tip-top, 
all the way down to your feet. 

Oh.. and we can go slow.. 
Yeah we can go slow.. Oh. 

Lay on your back, you like it right there. 
Don't have to say it twice love, there's nothing here to fear. 
Taking it back, back to where it's clear. 
Rolling on and on, sounds of love are in the air. 

I'm gonna ride, I'm gonna ride, 
I'm gonna ride, I'm, I'm gonna ride. 
On you baby, on you lady.. all night, all, all night. 
I'm gonna take care of your body, 
I'll be gentle don't you scream. 
It's getting hotter, make it softer, feel your chest on top of me. 

I'm gonna ride, I'm gonna ride, 
I'm gonna ride, I'm, I'm gonna ride. 
On you baby, on you lady.. all night, all, all night. 
I'm gonna make you feel that loving, getting weak all in your knees. 
Kiss your body from the tip-top, 
all the way down to your feet. 

Love, love, ooh, ooh, yeah. 

Suns coming up.. 
You're on my side. 
I rub your thigh.. 
You look in my eyes, and I just see the sky. 
I'm so high, but I ain't smoked yet, I'm just coming down from this. 

I'm gonna ride, I'm gonna ride, 
I'm gonna ride, I'm, I'm gonna ride. 
On you baby, on you lady.. all night, all, all night. 
I'm gonna take care of your body, 
I'll be gentle don't you scream. 
It's getting hotter, make it softer, feel your chest on top of me. 

I'm gonna ride, I'm gonna ride, 
I'm gonna ride, I'm, I'm gonna ride. 
On you baby, on you lady.. all night, all, all night. 
I'm gonna make you feel that loving, getting weak all in your knees. 
Kiss your body from the tip-top, 
all the way down to your feet.
