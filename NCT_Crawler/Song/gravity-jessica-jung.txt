                        Bài hát: Gravity - Jessica Jung

Something always brings me back to you. 
It never takes too long. 
No matter what I say or do I'll still feel you here 
'till the moment I'm gone. 

You hold me without touch. 
You keep me without chains. 
I never wanted anything so much than to drown in your love 
And not feel your rain. 

Set me free, leave me be. 
I don't want to fall another moment into your gravity. 
Here I am and I stand so tall, just the way I'm supposed to be. 
But you're on to me and all over me. 

You loved me 'cause I'm fragile. 
When I thought that I was strong. 
But you touch me for a little while 
And all my fragile strength is gone. 

Set me free, leave me be. 
I don't want to fall another moment into your gravity. 
Here I am and I stand so tall, just the way I'm supposed to be. 
But you're on to me and all over me. 

I live here on my knees as I try to make you see 
That you're everything I think I need here on the ground. 
But you're neither friend nor foe though I can't seem to let you go. 
The one thing that I still know is that you're keeping me down, 
You're keeping me down 
Something always brings me back to you, 
It never takes too long
                        
                    |
