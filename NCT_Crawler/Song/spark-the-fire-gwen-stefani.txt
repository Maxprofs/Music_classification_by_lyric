                        Bài hát: Spark The Fire - Gwen Stefani

I'm coming down, ooh, I had a blast
But you know what they say, the high will never last
But I believe that they all got it wrong 
So sprinkle some more love right here where it belongs

Who got the lighter
Let's spark the fire
Who got the lighter
Let's spark the fire 
Who got the lighter
Let's spark the fire
Who got the lighter
Let's spark the fire

O. M. G, O. M. G, I'm back again
Original feel-good is what I defend
I'mma believe and no, I don't pretend
Know what it's like when you look up and grin
The person next to you, feel that energy
Let's lift them up even high as can be 
Finally remembering what is me
That is what happens when I get with P

Hey! Get off my cloud 
Hey! Get off my style 
Stay above the crowd 
Or make your way back down

Hey! Get off my cloud 
Hey! Get off my style 
Stay above the crowd 
Or make your way back down

Who got the lighter
Let's spark the fire
Who got the lighter
Let's spark the fire 
Who got the lighter
Let's spark the fire
Who got the lighter
Let's spark the fire

Let's go hard, let's go hard, hard as can go
It is time for the girl's species to grow
2015, we take off our shell
I am a Libra, let's balance the scales

L. O. L., the world should get ready cause we will prevail
Somebody has to, so maybe it's me
Say this with me and raise the frequency

Hey! Get off my cloud 
Hey! Get off my style 
Stay above the crowd 
Or make your way back down 

Hey! Get off my cloud 
Hey! Get off my style 
Stay above the crowd 
Or make your way back down 

Who got the lighter
Let's spark the fire
Who got the lighter
Let's spark the fire 
Who got the lighter
Let's spark the fire
Who got the lighter
Let's spark the fire

Something's telling me
It takes a try to super-view L. You. V
Was losing focus, lost the perfect Lego piece
Got new glasses so finally I can see
Spark the fire

Hey! Get off my cloud 
Hey! Get off my style 
Stay above the crowd 
Or make your way back down 

Who got the lighter
Let's spark the fire
Who got the lighter
Let's spark the fire 
Who got the lighter
Let's spark the fire
Who got the lighter
Let's spark the fire

So much cooler when you do it, do it
Uh! So much cooler when you do it, do it
Uh-huh, everybody let's go!
