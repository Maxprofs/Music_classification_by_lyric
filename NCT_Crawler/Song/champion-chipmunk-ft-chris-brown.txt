                        Song: Champion - Chipmunk, Chris Brown

Some people have to learn
Some people wait there turn
Some people have to fight
Some people give their lives

[Verse 1 - Chipmunk:]
They wanna hold you back, tell 'em pee off
Whenever they say you can't, take the "t" off
I remember when they told me I wouldn't be famous
Now my dream and reality is simultaneous
And work your own way to the top
If they put you on a pedestal they can take you off
And there's a higher level than the top
You gotta make more, don't make do with what you got
Yeah, so get it in, go sonny
Not everybody gets a second chance at getting money
Or even getting lucky so you gotta feel
The hunger in your tummy

[Hook - Chris Brown:]
I'm always pushing myself to the limit
Making sure I stay ahead
You made me who I am, from the words you said

Some people have to learn
Some people wait there turn
Some people but not me
I was born a champion

Some people have to fight
Some people give their lives
Some people don't believe
But I was born a champion
But I was born a champion
But I was born a champion

[Verse 2 - Chris Brown:]
This gonna be the realest *** I ever wrote
Off the record, no camera’s, forget a quote
Some of my family doing good, most doing dope
I'm from Virginia where they hang the niggas by a rope
I used to see my momma getting beat down
Is that the real definition of me now?
I fell off, back on my feet now
Headed to the sky, can’t even see down
Award shows, I poured my heart out
And people still steady trynna point my flaws out
And I’d be lying if I said it ain’t get to me
But I’m a champion, legend, history

[Hook]

[Verse 3 - Chipmunk:] [only at Album Version!]
Imagine you was the one, that couldn't get a look in
Couldn't get a booking
Couldn't get a push in when you needed a shove
Or your buttons they be pushing
So now they tryna shush him
It's only you believing in you
They turn you into a *** the moment you rude
Attitude a little out of tune
But that's how champions move
Yeah so go and get it in sonny
Not everybody gets a second chance at getting money
Or even getting lucky
So you gotta feel the hunger in your tummy

[Hook] [only at Album Version!]

[Verse 4 - Chipmunk:]
No-one wants to help
I guess you're on your own
Build a foundation with the bricks they throw
In a black and white world, true colors show
Change if you want, everybody grows
Life's like an eel, but try and get a hold
Opinions ain't facts, take em and let em go

[Hook - Chris Brown:]
You made me who I am from the words you said

Some people have to learn
Some people wait there turn
Some people but not me
I was born a champion (champion)

Some people have to fight
Some people give their lives
Some people don't believe
But I was born a champion

Some people have to learn
Some people wait there turn
Some people but not me
I was born a champion (champion)

Some people have to fight
Some people give their lives
Some people don't believe
But I was born a champion
But I was born a champion
But I was born a champion
