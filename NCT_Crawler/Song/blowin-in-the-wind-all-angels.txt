                        How many roads most a man walk down
 Before you call him a man?
 How many seas must a white dove sail
 Before she sleeps in the sand?
 How many times must the cannon balls fly
 Before they're forever banned?
 The answer my friend is blowin' in the wind
 The answer is blowin' in the wind. How many years can a mountain exist
 Before it's washed to the sea?
 How many years can some people exist
 Before they're allowed to be free?
 How many times must a man turn his head
 Pretending he just doesn't see?
 The answer my friend is blowin' in the wind
 The answer is blowin' in the wind. How many times must a man look up
 Before he can see the sky?
 Yes, how many ears must one man have
 Before he can hear people cry?
 How many deaths will it take till he knows
 That too many people have died?
 The answer my friend is blowin' in the wind
 The answer is blowin' in the wind.
 The answer my friend is blowin' in the wind
 The answer is blowin' in the wind. The answer is blowin' in the wind.
