                        [Intro:]
 One two three uh! 

 [Verse One - Andre 3000]
 My baby don't mess around
 Because she loves me so
 And this I know for shooo... 
 Uh, but does she really wanna
 But can't stand to see me
 Walk out the dooor
 Don't try to fight the feelin'
 Because the thought alone is killing me right noww
 Uh, thank god for mom and dad
 For sticking two together
 'Cause we don't know howw
 Uh! 

 [Chorus:]
 Heeeyyy Yaaaaaaa
 Heeyy Yaaaaaaaa
 Heeeyyy Yaaaaaaa
 Heeyy Yaaaaaaaa
 Heeeyyy Yaaaaaaa
 Heeyy Yaaaaaaaa

 [Verse Two - Andre 3000]
 You think you've got it
 Oh, you think you've got it
 But got it just don't get it
 Till' there's nothing at 
 Aaaaaalll
 We get together
 Oh, we get together
 But separate's always better when there's feelings
 Invooooolved
 If what they say is "Nothing is forever"
 Then what makes, Then what makes, Then what makes
 Then what makes, Then what makes love? Love the exception. 
 So why you why you why you, why you, why you are we so in denial
 When we know we're not happy heeeere
 Y'all don't want me here you just wanna dance

 [Chorus:]
 Heyyy Yaaaaaaa (Ohh oh)
