                        Song: Hot Butterfly - The 69 Eyes

My girl wears a flower in her hair
Her cookies make the crule world disappear
The way she moves gives me this cicadelic illusion
She's hot hot hot butterfly

You gotta move baby
You gotta move to the groove now
You gotta move baby
You gotta move to the groove now

Mother nature
Takes care of her child
We're the children o freedom
You can join us anytime
Take my hand baby
And let your mind run wild
She's hot hot hot butterfly

You gotta move baby
You gotta move to the groove now
You gotta move baby
You gotta move to the groove now

I was walkin
On my bended knees
I was drunk
And seein' things
Like the warmth comes
With the rising sun
She brought me
The avalanche of love

She's hot hot hot baby
                        
                    |
