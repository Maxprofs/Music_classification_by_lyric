                        Bài hát: Linked - Jim Yosef, Anna Yvette

[Anna Yvette]
More then lovers
Destined to find, one another
Like lightning and thunder
Can't have one without the other (woah)

It was written in the stars
Oh, we can't be torn apart
We are linked together
Forged in fire forever
We are linked together, together

[Beat-Bass - Jim Yosef]

[Anna Yvette]
Past the rings of saturn
Across the milky way
Where it's raining diamonds
We'll return someday
Speaking life of words
In perfect harmony
I'll run away with you to another galaxy

It was written in the stars
Oh, we can't be torn apart
We are linked together
Forged in fire forever
We are linked together, together

[Beat-Bass - Jim Yosef]

We are linked, together
We are linked, together
We are linked, together
We are linked, together
(Oh, woah)
                        
                    |
