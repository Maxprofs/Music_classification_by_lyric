                        Bài hát: Charity - Maranatha! Music

Although I speak with the tongues
Of men and of angels
Although I prophesy
And understand all
Although I have all faith
That mountains could be removed
Although I feed the poor
And give of my life 

CH: If I have not charity
 If love does not flow through me
 I am nothing
 Jesus reduce me to love
 Jesus reduce me to love 

Love is patient and kind
And love is not envious
Not proud but gentle and meek
Seeks not its own way
Love sings when Jesus prevails
Believes and endures all things
Love hopes and bears every wrong
And love never fails 

CHORUS 

One season I was a child
I spake and thought as a child
But when I turned to a man
Such things put away
And now we see through a glass
But then we shall see face to face
Though now abide faith and hope
The greatest is love 

CHORUS
                        
                    |
