Baby
It's been a long coming
Such a long long time
And I can't stop running
Such a long long time
Can you hear my heart beating?
Can you hear that sound
Coz I can't help thinking
And I won't stop now

And then I look up at the sun
And I could see
O the way that gravity pours
On you and me
And then I look up at the sky
And saw the sun
And the way that gravity pushes
On everyone
On everyone

Baby
When your wheels stop turning
And you feel let down
And it seems like troubles
Have come all around
I can hear your heart beating
I can hear that sound
But I can't help thinking
And I won't look now

And then I looked up at the sun
And I could see
Oh the way that gravity pours
On you and me
And then I looked up at the sky
And saw the sun
And the way that gravity pushes
on everyone...
