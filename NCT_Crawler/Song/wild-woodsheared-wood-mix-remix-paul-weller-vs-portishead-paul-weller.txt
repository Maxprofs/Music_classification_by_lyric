                        High tide - mid afternoon
 People fly by in the traffics boom
 Knowing - where you're blowing
 Getting to where you should be going.
 Don't let them get you down
 Making you feel guilty about
 Golden rain bring you riches
 All the good things - you deserve now.

 Climbing forever trying
 Find your way out - of the wild wild wood
 Now there's no justice
 There's only yourself - that you can trust in
 And I said - high tide mid afternoon
 People fly by in the traffics boom
 Knowing - just where you're blowing
 Getting to where you should be going.

 Day by day your world fades away
 Waiting to feel - all the dreams that say
 Golden rain will bring you riches
 All the good things - you deserve now - and I say
 Climbing forever trying
 Find your way out - of the wild wild wood
                        
                    |
