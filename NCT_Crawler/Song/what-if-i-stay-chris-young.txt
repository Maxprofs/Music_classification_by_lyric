                        Bài hát: What If I Stay - Chris Young

Did you see the movie is over
I guess we missed the last half
Layin' here in this bed together
Me kissin' you you kissin' me back
It's getting late can't you see
I should get up and leave
If I don't you know where it's goin'

But you're givin' me that look baby
That says you're up to no good maybe
And you're whispering into my neck
Leavin' thoughts inside my head
Well now since you put it that way
If I need to I'll go darlin'
But what if I stay
What if I stay

Here comes that sun through the window
Feels like we just got to sleep
But the way you look on that pillow
Don'tcha know it's killin' me yeah
It's gettin' early can't ya see
I should get up and leave
If I don't you know where it's goin'

But you're givin' me that look baby
That says you're up to no good maybe
And you're whispering into my neck
Leavin' thoughts inside my head
Well now since you put it that way
If I need to I'll go darlin'
But what if I stay wrapped up in your arms

Cause lovin' you baby's been pretty perfect so far
And you're givin' me that look
The one that says you're up to no good yeah
And now you're whispering into my neck
Leavin' thoughts inside my head
Well now since you put it that way
I should probably go darlin'
But what if I stay
What if I stay
Oh what if I stay
