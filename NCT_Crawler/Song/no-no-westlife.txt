                        Bài hát: No No - Westlife

Once we had it all for the taking
Love was just me and you
You'd better think twice
About the plans that your making
Splitting one world in two

Put your mind in doubt
Did you ever think about
Everything that were missing
Don't you make me see what is best for me
'Cos i just wont listen baby

No no no no
I don't need nobody
Anyone to take your place but you

No no no no
I just couldn't fall for anyone new
Nobody but you

Girl you are the life that im living
I just cant go on without you
Lets make it alright
Wake up to what we've been given
Remember the things we've been through
Yeah

Put your mind in doubt
Did you ever think about
Everything that were missing
Don't you make me see
What is best for me
'Cos i just wont listen baby

No no no no
I don't need nobody
Anyone to take your place but you

No no no no
I just couldn't fall for anyone new
Nobody but you

I can't imagine the two of us apart
I cant find can't find a reason

'Cos i still believe (theres no one like you)
Thats what i need
(nobody but you)

Don't need nobody
To take your place but you
Don't need nobody at all
No no (no no)
