                        I got a lot of things
I have to do..
All these distractions
Our futures coming soon
We're Being pulled a hundred different directions
But whatever happens I know I've got you

Your on my mind your in my heart
It doesn't matter where we are
We'll be alright
Even if we're miles apart

All I wanna do is be with you be with you
There's nothing we can do 
Just wanna be with you
Only you
No matter where life takes us nothing can break us apart..
You know its true
I just wanna be with you

(Just be with you)

You know how life can be
It changes overnight
Its sunny but raining, but its alright
A friend like you..
Always makes it easy
I know that your kidding me every time.

Through every up through every down
You know I'll always be around
Through everything you can count on me..

All I wanna do is be with you be with you
There's nothing we can do 
Just wanna be with you
Only you
No matter where life takes us nothing can break us apart..
You know its true
I just wanna be with you

I just wanna be with you...
