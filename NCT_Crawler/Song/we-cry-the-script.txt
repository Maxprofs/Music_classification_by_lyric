                        Song: We Cry - The Script

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Together we cry
Together we cry

Jenny was a poor girl living in a rich world
Named her baby Hope when she was just fourteen
She was hoping for a better world for this little girl
But the apple doesn't fall too far from the tree

When she gets that call Hope's too far gone
Her baby's on the way, nothing left inside
Together we cry

What about the junk head? Could have gone the whole way
Lighting up the stage trying to get a deal
Now he's lighting up the wrong way, something for the pain
Man, you wanna see this kid he was so *** unreal

When he gets that call he's too far gone
To get it together to sing one song
They won't hear tonight the words of a lullaby

Together we cry, yeah, yeah
Together we cry, whoa
Together we cry, oh, we cry, we cry, oh, we cry, we cry
Together we cry, oh, oh

Oh, Mary's ambitious, she wanna be a politician
She been dreaming about it since she was a girl
She thought that she'd be the one who could change the world
Always trying to pave the way for women in a man's world

But life happened, house, kids, two cars, husband hits the jar
Cheques that don't go very far now
Now she in it, can't change it, she keeps her mind on her wages
The only rattling cages rile her, oh

Together we cry
Together we cry

There's so much sad, gonna flood the ocean
We're all in tears for the world is broken
Together we cry, oh, we cry, we cry, oh, we cry

There comes a time when every bird has to fly
At some point every rose has to die
It?s hard to let your children go, leave home
Where they go? Who knows!
Getting drunk, getting stoned all alone

Teach a man to fish, you feed him now for life
You show your kids the truth, hope they never lie
Instead of reading in a letter that they've gone to something better
Bet you're sorry now, I won't be coming home tonight

I?m sick of looking for those heroes in the sky
To teach us how to fly
Together we cry, together we cry

Together we cry, cry
Together we cry, oh yeah
There's so much sad, gonna flood the ocean
We're all in tears for the world is broken

Together we cry, oh yeah
Together we cry, cry
Together we cry, cry, yeah, yeah
Together we cry
But life happened, house, kids, two cars, husband hits the jar
Cheques that don?t go very far now
Now she in it, can?t change it, she keeps her mind on her wages
The only rattling cages rile her, oh
                        
                    |
