                        Song: Ten Thousand Angels Cried - LeAnn Rimes

Stillness filled the heavens, on crucifixion day.
 Some say it rained, I don't know if it's true.
 Well, I can just imagine ten thousand angels crying
 That would seem like rain to me and you. The angels all stood ready to take Him from the tree
 They waited for the words from His own voice.
 And when He asked the Father why has Thou forsaken Me.
 They watched the Savior die of His own choice. I've never seen ten thousand angels cry
 But I'm sure they did
 As they stood by
 And watched the Savior die. God turned His head away
 He couldn't bear the sight
 It must have looked like rain
 When ten thousand angels cried. As the sun slipped away
 The skies turned to grey
 And when Jesus gave His all
 That's when the tears began to fall I've never seen ten thousand angels cry
 But I'm sure they did
 As they stood by
 And watched the Savior die. God turned His head away
 He couldn't bear the sight
 It must have looked like rain
 When ten thousand angels cried. It must have looked like rain
 When ten thousand angels cried.
