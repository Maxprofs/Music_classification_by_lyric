Romaji: 

Suki da yo to tsutaereba ii noni 
negau saki kowaku te iezu 
suki da yo to suki da yo ga 
tsunotte wa toketeku 
kimi to no jikan ga ichi byō demo nagaku 
naru nara zutto ja nakute ii 
negaikakeru koi oto to amazora 

kimi to hanare te kara sū nichi 
kono doshaburi no ame no naka 
konna hi wa kanarazu kasa o todoke ni itta 

itsumo no machiawase no basho 
iru hazu no nai omokage matsu 
kasa mo sasazu zubunure de kimi wa soko ni ita 

kajikan da te o atatameru 
koto ga mōichido dekiru nara 
hajimari no toki made modori tai 

suki da yo to tsutaereba ii noni 
negau saki kowakute iezu 
suki ja nai suki da yo ga 
yureru koi oto to amazora 

kimi to no jikan ga ichi byō demo nagaku 
naru nara zutto ja naku te ii 
ame ga yamu made kono mama isase te 

shinjita ashita o 
kimi wa doko de warau no 
nagashi saru rikimo naku 
ano hi no mama de jikan ga tomaru 
shizuku ga futatsu kimi no hō o tsutau 
taezu yama nu ame no sei to 
koi oto wa utau? 

machi yuku koibito ga urayamashiku omou koto ga fue ta 
itsu kara 1 nin ga kowaku natta n daro u 
demo ima wa tsukanoma no shiawase 
dekiru koto nara kono mama 
arifure ta koibito tachi ni nari tai 

kimi ga koko de nozon de iru koto 
boku ga koko de ii tai koto 
ima nara omoi mo kasanaru ka na 

suki da yo to tsutaere ba ii noni 
negau saki kowaku te ie zu 
yokogao o mitsumeteru 
sore dake demo uii 
dakedo ichi nigiri no shiawase mo 
kimi ga kure ta mono da kara 
honto wa zutto dakishime te itai 

surechigai mo futari mōichido yarinaosu tame no shiren datte 
sugu ni ieru no nara donnani ii daro u ka 

suki toyuu jijitsu tōrisugi te ima de wa mō aishiteru 
ushinatte sū nichikan de yatto shitta

suki da yo to suki da yo ga 
tsunotte wa toke te ku 

kimi to no jikan ga ichi byō demo nagaku 
naru nara zutto ja naku te ii 
negaikakeru koi oto to amazora 


English 

If I could just conveyed my love, 
And how I wish that it will sink into you but I feared it wont 
All those I love you I love You 
grow inside of me and melts 

It feels a long time every second with you 
You don't neew to think much of it 
I make a wish to sound of love and rainy sky 

Few days after we separated 
Inside of me this pouring rain 
Such day like this, you always bring me umbrella 

Always on the same place, I wait to see your face 
even though I knew you wont be there 
But you're there, soaking in wet, not bringing umbrella 

If I could warm your numb hands 
once again 
I want to go back to the time it first happened 

If I could just conveyed my love, 
And how I wish that it will sink into you but I feared it wont 
All those I love you I love You 
I make a wish to sound of love and rainy sky 

It feels a long time every second with you 
You don't neew to think much of it 
Let me stay with your until the rain stops 

About tomorrow we believed in, 
Where are you laughing? 
Without having powers to slip aways from us, 
it reminds me the day where 
two tear drops goes down on your face 
and with this continous rain 
Could sounds of love sing? 

I've become jealous to all the lovers roaming into the streets 
I wonder, since when I've been alone? 
but if happiness is momentary now 
maybe I could pull it off right now 
I want to be like a common lovers now 

Thing that you want here 
is what I want to say right here 
I wonder if our feelings now could overlap? 

If I could just conveyed my love, 
& how I wish that it will sink into you but I feared it wont 
I'm looking it now 
sharing is enough 
but you have given me 
a handful of happiness, 
the truth is I want to be hug by you 

If I could only say, that the reason we're here 
is to start all over again 

The fact is, I love you nw 
I've realized it after few days we got lost 
the truth is, I wanted to make sure of these feelings I have 

If I could just conveyed my love, 
And how I wish that it will sink into you but I feared it wont 
All those I love you I love You 
grow inside of me and melts 

It feels a long time every second with you 
You don't neew to think much of it 
I make a wish to sound of love and rainy sky
                        
                    |
