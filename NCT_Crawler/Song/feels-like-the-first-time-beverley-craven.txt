                        Bài hát: Feels Like The First Time - Beverley Craven

Forget it, I tell myself
There’s some else sharing your life
And we’ll regret it when it’s too late
We’ll lie awake in the dark
Pretending everything’s the same
But knowing me I will be in love again
When your eyes meet mine
I change the conversation
And then you kill me with a smile
Maybe it’s too much wine
And my imagination
It feels like the first time

Don’t let it be over yet
I wanna get closer to you
’cos you’re making me feel alive
I know that it isn’t right
Inside me there’s a tug of war
And now that I can’t resist it anymore

When your eyes meet mine
I change the conversation
And then you kill me with a smile
Maybe it’s too much wine
And my imagination
It feels like the first time
It feels like the first time

It feels like the first time

When your eyes meet mine
I change the conversation
And then you kill me with a smile
Maybe it’s too much wine
And my imagination
It feels like the first time

It feels like the first time
                        
                    |
