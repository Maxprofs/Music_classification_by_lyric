 Title: Sorry
Broken hearts and last goodbyes
Restless nights but lullabies
Helps make this pain go away
I realize I let you down
Told you that I'd be around
Building up the strength just to say

I'm sorry
For breaking all the promises that I wasn't around to keep.
If only..
This time is the last time that I will ever beg you to stay.
But your already on your way.

Filled with sorrow, filled with pain
Knowing that I am to blame
For leaving your heart out in the rain
And I know your gonna walk away
And leave me with the price to pay
But before you go I wanted to say
Yeah!

That I'm sorry
For breaking all the promises that I wasn't around to keep
If only..
This time is the last time that I will ever beg you to stay.
But you're already on your way.

Can't make it alive on my own
But if you have to go, then please girl
Just leave me alone.
Cause I don't want to see you and me going our separate ways.
I'm begging you to stay
If it isn't too late

I'm sorry
For breaking all the promises that I wasn't around to keep.
If only..
This time is the last time that I will ever beg you to stay.
But your already on your way.
But your already on your way...
