                        Bài hát: You’Re My Heart, You’Re My Soul (Modern Talking Mix ’98) - Modern Talking, Eric Singleton

Deep in my heart - here's a fire - a burning heart 
Deep in my heart - there's desire - for a start 
I'm dying in emotion 
It's my world in fantasy 
I'm living in my, living in my dreams 

You're my heart, you're my soul 
I'll keep it shining everywhere I go 
You're my heart, you're my soul 
I'll be holding you forever 
Stay with you together 

(chorus) :
Your my heart, you're my soul 
Yeah, I'm feeling that our love will grow 
You're my heart, you're my soul 
That's the only thing I really know 

**2**
Let's close the door and believe my burning heart 
Feeling alright come on open up your heart A keep the candles burning 
Let your body melt in mine 
I'm living in my, living in my dreams 

You're my heart, you're my soul 
I'll keep it shining everywhere I go 
You're my heart, you're my soul 
I'll be holding you forever 
Stay with you together 

(chorus) :
Your my heart, you're my soul 
Yeah, I'm feeling that our love will grow 
You're my heart, you're my soul 
That's the only thing I really know 

Your my heart, you're my soul 
Yeah, I'm feeling that our love will grow 
You're my heart, you're my soul 
That's the only thing I really know
