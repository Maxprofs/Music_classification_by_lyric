                        Bài hát: Guardians Inferno (From "Guardians Of The Galaxy Vol. 2") - The Sneepers, David Hasselhoff

[Hasselhoff]
Getting down and dirty with a procyon lotor
Got no people skills but he's good with motors

That weird thing by his side an infantilized sequoia
The two of them walk by, people say "Oh boy-a"

They ask me why I'm bringin'
A baby into battle

"Thats really irresponsible"
And getting them rattled

I say "Give me a break
Get off my back dammit"

I didn't learn parenting
My daddy was a planet

Zardu Hasselfrau (x2)

In these times of hardship
Just remember
We
Are
Groot
