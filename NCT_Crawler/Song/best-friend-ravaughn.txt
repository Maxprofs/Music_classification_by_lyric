                        Bài hát: Best Friend - RaVaughn

I know you got that perfect 20/20,baby.
No need for them glasses or them contacts
So tell me Why?Tell me Why?
Why can't you see?

Everytime you're kissing her in front of me,
It hurts
I'm human baby
It hurts.

[Đk:]
I'm not f**king best friend
I've been sittin' on this bench too long
While you're playing with these
Basic fake chicks
And come complaining when it all goes wrong.

If you open your eyes
And give sense a good try 
I'll be all you need
And more 
Than a f**king best friend.

Was I ever an option on the phone talking
2 o'clock in the morning
Asking me to fix what's broken
Open up my heart and then you stole it 

Those random times
I cross your mind
Do I give you butterflies?
Cuz Baby I get chills everytime I chill witcha 

[Đk:]
Cause I'm not your f**king best friend
I've been sittin' on this bench too long
While you're playing with these
Basic fake chicks
And come complaining when it all goes wrong

If you open your eyes 
And give sense a good try 
I'll be all your need
And more 
Than a f**king best friend

And can't tell me, I'm crazy for felling this way 
And maybe it's the wrong time
But I'm in the right place 
So while you got me here 
Look me straight in the eyes 
And tell me everything I feel is a lie
Whoaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa.

Cause I'm not f**king best friend
I've been sittin' on this bench too long 
While you're playing with these
Basic fake chicks
And come complaining when it all goes wrong

If you open your eyes(Open your eyes)
And give sense a good try 
I'll be all you need
And more
Than f**king best friend.

[Đk:]
Why can't you see it?
It could be me and you.

I'll be all you need 
And more 
Than a f**king best friend
