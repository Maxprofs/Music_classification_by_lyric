                        Hey, oh
 Let me tell you no
 Oh baby

 Trying to decide, trying to decide
 If I, really want to go out tonight
 I never used to go out, without you
 I'm not sure I remember how to

 I'm gonna be late, gonna be late
 But, all my girls gonna have to wait
 Cause, I don't know if I like my outfit
 I tried everything in my closet

 Nothing feels right when I'm not with you
 Sick of this dress and these Jimmy Choos
 Taking them off, cause I feel a fool
 Trying to dress up, when I'm missing you
 I'ma step out of this lingerie
 Curl up in a ball with something Hanes
 In bed I lay, with nothing but, your T-Shirt on
 Oh, with nothing but, your T-Shirt on

 Hey, gotta be strong, gotta be strong
 But, I'm really hurting now that your gone
 I thought maybe I'd do some shopping
 But, I didn't get pass the door and
 Now I don't know, now I don't know
 If I'm ever gonna let you go
 And I couldn't even leave my apartment
 I'm stripped down, torn up about it

 Nothing feels right when I'm not with you
 Sick of this dress and these Jimmy Choos
 Taking them off, cause I feel a fool
 Trying to dress up when I'm missing you
 I'ma step out of this lingerie
 Curl up in a ball and something Hanes
 In bed I lay, with nothing but your T-Shirt on
 Oh, with nothing but, your T-Shirt on

 Trying to decide, trying to decide
 If I really want to go out tonight
 I couldn't even leave my apartment
 I'm stripped down, torn up about it

 Nothing feels right when I'm not with you
 Sick of this dress and these Jimmy Choos
 Taking them off, cause I feel a fool
 Trying to dress up when I'm missing you
 I'ma step out of this lingerie
 Curl up in a ball and something Hanes
 In bed I lay

 Hey, hey

 Nothing feels right when I'm not with you
 Sick of this dress and these Jimmy Choos
 Taking them off, cause I feel a fool
 Trying to dress up when I'm missing you
 I'ma step out of this lingerie
 Curl up in a ball and something Hanes
 In bed I lay, with nothing but your T-Shirt on
 Oh, with nothing but, your T-Shirt on

 Let me tell you know
 With nothing but, your T-Shirt on
