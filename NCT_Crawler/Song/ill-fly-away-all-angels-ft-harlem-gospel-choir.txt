                        Some glad morning when this life is over,
 I'll fly away;
 To a home on God's celestial shore,
 I'll fly away (I'll fly away). Chorus
 I'll fly away, Oh Glory
 I'll fly away;
 When I die, Hallelujah, by and by,
 I'll fly away When the shadows of this life have gone,
 I'll fly away;
 Like a bird from these prison walls
 I'll fly away (I'll fly away) Chorus Oh, how glad and happy when we meet
 I'll fly away
 No more cold or shackles on my feet
 I'll fly away I'll fly away, Oh Glory
 I'll fly away; in the morning
 When I die, Hallelujah, by and by,
 I'll fly away. Just a few more weary days and then,
 I'll fly away;
 To a land where joy shall never end,
 I'll fly away I'll fly away, Oh Glory
 I'll fly away; in the morning
 When I die, Hallelujah, by and by,
 I'll fly away.
