                        Bài hát: Remember Me (Reunion) - Anthony Gonzalez, Ana Ofelia Murguia

[MIGUEL]
Remember me
Though I have to say goodbye
Remember me
Don't let it make you cry
For even if I'm far away, I hold you in my heart
I sing a secret song to you each night we are apart
Remember me
Though I have to travel far
Remember me

[MIGUEL & MAMÀ COCO]
Each time you hear a sad guitar
Know that I'm with you the only way that I can be
Until you're in my arms again
Remember me
                        
                    |
