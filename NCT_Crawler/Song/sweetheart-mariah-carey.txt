Mariah Carey: Sweetheart
Boy haven't you noticed
A gleam in my eye
Because of you
I'm a little hypnotized
But every time you're with me
I feel so positive
Now with a little love
Something's got to give
A full moon (yeah yeah)
Is waiting in the twilight
Maybe soon
You will come to be my night
Here we are
Hoping that we never part
Stay with me
Baby, won't you be my sweetheart
We could share a storybook romance
Won't you be my sweetheart
We could share a storybook romance
Just you and I
You are no Casanova
I know that you'll be true
And that's why
I'm so in love with you
But each romantic ending
You leave me at my door
But tonight
I'd like us to explore
Stars are bright
Mood is right
(Say what MC baby sing it to me)
To keep me warn away from harm
Nowhere better than my baby's arms
You know I need your love
Romance
