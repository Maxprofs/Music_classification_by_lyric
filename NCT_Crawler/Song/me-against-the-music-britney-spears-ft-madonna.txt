                        Song: Me Against The Music]
Artists: Britney Spears, Madonna 
All my people in the crowd
Grab a partner take it down!
It's me against the music
(Uh uh)
It's just me
(And me)
Yeah
It's whippin' my hair, it's pullin' my waist
The sweat is drippin' all over my face
I'm the only one dancin' up in this place
Feel the beat of the drum, gotta get with that bass
I'm up against the speaker, tryin' to take on the music
It's like a competition, me against the beat
I wanna get in a zone,
 I wanna get in a zone
If you really wanna battle, saddle up and get your rhythm
Tryin' to hit it, chic-a-taa
In a minute I'm a take a you on,
 I'm a take a you on
Hey, hey, hey
All my people on the floor, let me see you dance
All my people wantin' more, let me see you dance
All my people round and round, let me see you dance
All my people in the crowd, let me see you dance
So how would you like a friendly competition, 
let's take on the song
Let's take on the song
It's you and me baby, we're the music time to party all night long
All night long

We're almost there
I'm feelin' it bad and I can't explain
My soul is bare
My hips are movin' at a rapid pace
From the tip of my toes, runnin' through my veins
And now's your turn
Let me see what you got, don't hesitate
I'm up against the speaker, tryin' to take on the music
It's like a competition, me against the beat
I wanna get in a zone, I wanna get in a zone
If you really wanna battle, saddle up and get your rhythm
Tryin' to hit it, chic-a-taa
In a minute I'm a take a you on, 
I'm a take a you on
Hey, hey, hey
All my people on the floor, let me see you dance
All my people wantin' more, let me see you dance
All my people round and round, let me see you dance
All my people in the crowd, let me see you dance
Get on the floor, baby lose control, 
Just work your body and let it go.
If you wanna party, just grab somebody
(Hey Britney)We can dance all night long
Hey Britney, you say you wanna lose control
Come over here I got somethin' to show ya
Sexy lady, I'd rather see you bare your soul
If you think you're so hot, better show me what you got
All my people in the crowd, let me see you dance ......
C'mon Britney lose control, watch you take it down
Get on the floor, baby lose control, 
Just work your body and let it go.
If you wanna party, just grab somebody
(Hey Britney)We can dance all night long
All my people on the floor, let me see you dance
All my people wantin' more, let me see you dance
All my people round and round, let me see you dance
All my people in the crowd, let me see you dance
All my people in the crowd, let me see you dance
C'mon Britney take it down, make the music dance
All my people round and round, party all night long
C'mon Britney lose control, watch you take it down
