                        ~All~
 Clang, clang, clang went the trolley
 Ding, ding, ding went the bell
 Zing, zing, zing went my heartstrings as we started for Huntington Dell.
 Chug, chug, chug went the motor
 Bump, bump, bump went the brake
 Thump, thump, thump went my heartstrings as we glided for Huntington Lake.
 The day was bright, the air was sweet
 The smell of honeysuckle charmed me off my feet
 I tried to sing, but couldn't squeak
 In fact I felt so good I couldn't even speak
 Buzz, buzz, buzz went the buzzer
 Time to all disembark, 
 Time to fall went my heartstrings as we got off at Huntington Park
 As we got off at Huntington Park.

 ~Judy~
 With my high-starched collar, and my high-topped shoes
 And my hair piled high upon my head
 I went to lose a jolly hour on the Trolley and lost my heart instead.
 With his light brown derby and his bright green tie
 He was quite the handsomest of men
 I started to yen, so I counted to ten the I counted to ten again
 Clang, clang, clang went the trolley
 Ding, ding, ding went the bell
 Zing, zing, zing went my heartstrings
 From the moment I saw him I fell
 Chug, chug, chug went the motor
 Bump, bump, bump went the brake
 Thump, thump, thump went my heartstrings
 When he smiled I could feel the car shake
 He tipped his hat, and took a seat
 He said he hoped he hadn't stepped upon my feet
 He asked my name, I held my breath
 I couldn't speak because he scared me half to death
 Chug, chug, chug went the motor
 Plop, plop, plop went the wheels
 Stop, stop, stop went my heartstrings
 As he started to go then I started to know how it feels
 When the universe reels

 ~All~
 The day was bright, the air was sweet
 The smell of honeysuckle charmed you off you're feet
 You tried to sing, but couldn't squeaks
 In fact, you loved him so you couldn't even speak

 ~Judy~
 Buzz, buzz, buzz went the buzzer
 Plop, plop, plop went the wheels
 Stop, stop, stop went my heartstrings
 As he started to leave I took hold of his sleeve with my hand
 And as if it were planned he stay on with me
 And it was grand just to stand with his hand holding mine
 To the end of the line
