                        Full full moon and
 That same sad nature
 I wanna cover every inch of you
 Like ink on paper
 Like the blind parade of souls
 Consumed by religion
 I can't wait 'til I get you
 In that defenseless position
 Chorus:
 When we set the prairie on fire
 Oh we go down to the water
 Naked and slow
 You and me
 And the heart of desire
 We set the prairie on fire
 How hard will the wind blow
 How far will it go
 When the feeling burns down
 To one solitary color
 The velocity of longing
 Melting into each other
 It's a song our fingers play
 All at once and together
 You can bet we never learned it
 But we've known it forever
 Oh I dreamed that we were flying
 Carried up from the ashes
 Black silhouettes of velvet
 Against the crimson of passion
 We can almost hear the echoes
 >From the smoldering meadow
 It's the rapture of the angels
 And the rage of the devil
 Chorus
 In the cool dusk of horses
 Through the rusted wires of sleep
 With our arms around midnight
 We're headed for release
 We go riding in the wind
 We go riding in the dark
 Go riding, riding
 Chorus
                        
                    |
