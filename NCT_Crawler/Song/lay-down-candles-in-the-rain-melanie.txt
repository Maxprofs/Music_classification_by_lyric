                        Lay down, lay down, lay it all down
 Let your white birds smile
 At the ones who stand and frown Lay down, lay down, lay it all down
 Let your white birds smile
 At the ones who stand and frown We were so close, there was no room
 We bled inside each other's wounds
 We all had caught the same disease
 And we all sang the songs of peace Lay down, lay down, lay it all down
 Let your white birds smile
 At the ones who stand and frown Lay down, lay down, lay it all down
 Let your white birds smile
 At the ones who stand and frown So raise candles high
 'Cause if you don't we could stay black against the night
 Oh, raise them higher again
 And if you do we could stay dry against the rain Lay down, lay down, lay it all down
 Let your white birds smile
 At the ones who stand and frown Lay down, lay down, lay it all down
 Let your white birds smile
 At the ones who stand and frown We were so close, there was no room
 We bled inside each other's wounds
 We all had caught the same disease
 And we all sang the songs of peace Some came to sing, some came to pray
 Some came to keep the dark away So raise candles high
 'Cause if you don't we could stay black against the sky
 Oh, oh, raise them higher again
 And if you do we could stay dry against the rain Lay down, lay down, lay it all down
 Let your white birds smile
 At the ones who stand and frown Lay down, lay down, lay it all down
 Let your white birds smile
 At the ones who stand and frown Lay down, lay down, lay it all down
 Let your white birds smile
 At the ones who stand and frown Lay down, lay down, lay it all down
 Let your white birds smile
 At the ones who stand and frown
