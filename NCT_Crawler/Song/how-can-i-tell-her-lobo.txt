                        Bài hát: How Can I Tell Her - Lobo


She knows when I am lonesome
 And She cries when i am sad
She's up in the good times
She's down in the bad
Whenever I am discouraged
She knows just what to do
But girl...
She doesn't know about you

I can tell her my troubles
She makes them all seem right
I can make up excuses
Not to hold her at night
We can talk of tomorrow
I'll tell her things that i wanna do
But girl...
How can I tell her about you

How can I tell her about you
Girl, please tell me what to do
Everythings seems right whenever I'm with you
So girl, won't you tell, how to tell her about you

How can I tell her I don't miss her
Whenever I am away
How can I say it's you I think of
Every single night and day
But when is it easy
Telling someone we're through
Oh girl, help me tell her about you

How can I tell her about you
Girl, please tell me what to do
Everything seems right whenever I'm with you...
So girl, won't you tell me, how to tell her about you
                        
                    |
