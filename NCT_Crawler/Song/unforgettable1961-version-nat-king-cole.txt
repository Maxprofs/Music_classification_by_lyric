 Unforgettable, that's what you are
 Unforgettablethough near or far
 Like a song of love that clings to me
 How the thought of you does things to me
 Never before has someone been more

 Unforgettable in every way
 And forever more, that's how you'll stay
 That's why, darling, it's incredible
 That someone so unforgettable
 Thinks that I am unforgettable too

 Unforgettable in every way
 And forever more, that's how you'll stay
 That's why, darling, it's incredible
 That someone so unforgettable
 Thinks that I am unforgettable too
