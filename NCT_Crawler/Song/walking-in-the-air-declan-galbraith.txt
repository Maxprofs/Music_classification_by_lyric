Âu Mỹ khác|

                        We’re walking in the air 
We’re floating in a moonlit sky 
The people far below 
Are sleeping as we fly 
I’m holding very tight 
I’m riding in the midnight blue 
I’m finding I can fly so high above with you.... 

All across the world 
The villages go by like dreams 
The rivers and the hills 
The forests and the streams 

Children gaze 
Open mouthed 
Taken by surprise 
Nobody 
Down below 
Believes 
Their eyes 

We’re surfing in the air 
We’re swimming in a frozen sky 
We’re drifting over ice 
See mountains floating by 

suddenly 
swooping low on an ocean deep 
rousing up 
a mighty monster from his sleep 

We’re walking in the air 
We’re dancing in the midnight sky 
And everyone who sees us 
Greets us as we fly 

We’re walking in the air... 
Walking in the air...
                        
                    |
