                        You know I’m trying to make it happen for us right now
I got to do what I got to do, for me and you

I remember we were living like Kings and Queens
In the little tiny castle made of hopes and dreams
It was destiny, it was meant to be
You was so complete, the perfect team

This suddenly there’s a glitch in the system
And it between us is a big strip of distance
They say it supposed to make the heart grow fonder
For more like I can tell it couldn’t be wronger

A little bit of more goes a long way
A little bit of right goes the wrong way
I keep giving, you keep taking
I’m tryna make a living be patient

All dressed up nowhere to go
So I’m dancing on my own
I’ve been waiting way too long
Dancing on my own

Play one more So-o-o-o-o-o-ong(x3)
But you are not coming So-o-o-o-o-o-ong(x3)
But you are not coming home

Listen,
I don’t want you dancing by yourself
And I don’t want you picturing yourself with someone else
I know I made some promises and honestly I wanna just to work out
I didn’t know the shining star I found was ’bout to burn out
So what now? We go around like a record
I feelin’ disconnected and you’re feelin’ disrespected
I don’t know how this gon' rap up
But till I’m home you should turn that track on

And that’s all I get from you, But I give my all to you
And that’s all I hear from you

All dressed up nowhere to go
So I’m dancing on my own
I’ve been waiting way too long
Dancing on my own

Play one more So-o-o-o-o-o-ong(x3)
But you are not coming So-o-o-o-o-o-ong(x3)
But you are not coming home

I always think about her,Try to not overthink about her
I Always dream about her,Try not to dream about her
I feel so lost without her,I try to come home
And it’s so hard being out on my own
It breaks my heart to leave you alone

And that's all i get from you .But i give my all to you
And that's all i hear from you

All dressed up nowhere to go
So I’m dancing on my own
I’ve been waiting way too long
Dancing on my own

Play one more So-o-o-o-o-o-ong(x3)
But you are not coming So-o-o-o-o-o-ong(x3)
But you are not coming home

I told you i'll be home.I told you i'll be back 
What was song do you go
I told you i'll be home.I told you i'll be back
I told you i'll be back girl.I told you i'll be home
                        
                    |
