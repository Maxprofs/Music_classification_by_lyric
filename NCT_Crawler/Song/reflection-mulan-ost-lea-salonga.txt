Âu Mỹ khác|

                        Look at me,
I will never pass
For a perfect bride, or a perfect daughter
Can it be
I'm not meant to play this part?

Now I see
That if I were truly to be myself
I would break my family's heart

Who is that girl I see
Staring straight back at me
Why is my reflection someone I don't know

Somehow I cannot hide
Who I am - though I tried
When will my reflection show
Who I am... inside...

When will my reflection show
Who I am... inside...
                        
                    |
