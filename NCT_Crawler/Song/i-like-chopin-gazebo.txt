                        Bài hát: I Like Chopin - Gazebo

Remember that piano, so delightful, unusual
That classic sensation, sentimental confusion
Used to say "I like Chopin"
Love me now and again, wooh

Rainy days never say goodbye
To desire when we are together
Rainy days growing in your eyes
Tell me where's no way

Imagine you're facin' a sunshine reflection
A vision of blue skies, Forever distractions
Used to say "I like Chopin"
Love me now and again, wooh

Rainy days never say goodbye
To desire when we are together
Rainy days growing in your eyes
Tell me where's no way
Rainy days never say goodbye
To desire when we are together
Rainy days growing in your eyes
Tell me where's no way
Rainy days never say goodbye
To desire when we are together
Rainy days growing in your eyes
Tell me where's no way
                        
                    |
