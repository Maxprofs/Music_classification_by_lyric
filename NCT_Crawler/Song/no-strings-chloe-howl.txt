                        Bài hát: No Strings - Chloe Howl

We're both there at the same time, we both go
Don't need to talk to each other, we got codes
Have a bit too much to drink, say hello
We're gonna go home together
We really should know better

But *** your no strings
And your 'hey I'll ring'
But I'm, but I'm imagining things
No strings, kinda hope I have twins
Come on, come on, am I imagining something?
You can't win at all
And the trouble with no strings is you can only fall

They're playing our favourite song
You come dance near me but not for long
You know sometimes I think you're so immature
Don't know what trip you're on
Don't even know if I'm the right sex
You don't even know if I'm the right sex, do ya?

*** your no strings
And your 'hey I'll ring'
But I'm, but I'm imagining things
No strings, kinda hope I have twins
Come on, come on, am I imagining something?
You can't win at all
And the trouble with no strings is you can only fall

With all this love you're unprotecting
I'd hate to think of what you're collecting
The novelty's worn
You can't get it for nothing
So let's put this to bed, put this to bed
Without crawling in your bed

But *** your no strings
And your 'hey I'll ring'
But I'm, but I'm imagining things
No strings, kinda hope I have twins
Come on, come on, am I imagining something?
You can't win at all
And the trouble with no strings is you can only fall

No more crawlin' in your bed

*** your no strings
And your 'hey I'll ring'
But I'm, but I'm imagining things
No strings, kinda hope I have twins
Come on, come on, am I imagining something?
You can't win at all
And the trouble with no strings is you can only fall
                        
                    |
