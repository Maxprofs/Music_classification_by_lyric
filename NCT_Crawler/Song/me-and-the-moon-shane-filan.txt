                        Bài hát: Me And The Moon - Shane Filan

I thought I saw you there
Holding my hand when you were scared
Scared of the dark, there's no lights in the park
Just the love we shared
How can such a part of me be gone

They say, home is a place where your heart is
Go back to the road where it started
Whether it's wrong or it's right
If you ever wonder, then I'll be
Back on the street where I met you
Drawing the stars like we used to
I wish I was holding you tight
But it's me and the moon tonight

I swear I saw you there
Just like the old days with no care
Down in the garden, the leaves were still falling
Right by the shed
How can such a part of me be gone

They say, home is a place where your heart is
Go back to the road where it started
Whether it's wrong or it's right
If you ever wonder, then I'll be
Back on the street where I met you
Drawing the stars like we used to
I wish I was holding you tight
But it's me and the moon tonight

Me and the moon tonight
Me and the moon tonight
Me and the moon tonight

I'll be, back on the street where I met you
Drawing the stars like we used to
I wish I was holding you tight
But it's me and the moon tonight

They say, home is a place where your heart is
Go back to the road where it started
Whether it's wrong or it's right
If you ever wonder, then I'll be
Back on the street where I met you
Drawing the stars like we used to
I wish I was holding you tight
But it's me and the moon tonight

But it's me and the moon tonigh
