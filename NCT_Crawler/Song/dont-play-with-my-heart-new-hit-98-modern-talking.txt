                        Don't Play.....
Don't Play With My Heart


You Can Stop My Heart
Love Is Here And Now You're Gone 
Oh Please, Don't Tear Apart
Baby, I Am So Alone
We're Looking On The Same Stars
And On The Same Moon
What Have I Done To You , Lady
Oh, Wherever You Are, Baby, Please Come Back Soon
Can't You See I'm Waiting For You


OH, Don't play with my heart
Don't do that again
If you break it apart - I cannot be your friend
Don't play with my heart
Again and again
If you tear it apart
How this love will end


Don't Play (Playing tricks with my heart) Don't Play (Playing tricks with my heart) Don't Play (Playing tricks with my heart) Don't Play (Playing tricks with my heart) 

Oh, You know it's true
I gave you every single day
Now, It's up to you
Baby, Please don't go away


Oh, we'll find paradise
And we'll loose it all
What have I done to you, baby
Don't Tell me no lies
Just give me a call
Can't you see I'm waiting for you
