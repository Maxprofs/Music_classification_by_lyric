Âu Mỹ khác|

                        I'm lying in my bed, all alone 
Called you once again, no one is home 
It's raining outside, on Saturday night 
Turning out the light, again I tried 

My friends say I'm too good, too good for you 
And maybe that is true, well I don't care 
What do they all know, they got it all wrong 
This is so unfair, they're playing our song 

Nobody gets too much heaven no more 
It's much harder to come by 
I'm waiting in line 
Nobody gets too much love anymore 
It's as high as a mountain 
And harder to climb 

Something's going on, what is wrong 
I want you to be here, why don't you come 
And spend some time with me, can't you see 
Have we come undone 
Is this the end of our song 

Nobody gets too much heaven no more 
It's much harder to come by 
I'm waiting in line 
Nobody gets too much love anymore 
It's as high as a mountain 
And harder to climb 

Nobody gets too much heaven no more 
It's much harder to come by 
I'm waiting in line 
Nobody gets too much love anymore 
It's as high as a mountain 
And harder to climb 

[BRIDGE] 
How do I deal 
With how I feel 
How to reveal 
Oooh... what is real love 
As another day fades away 
So I say 

Nobody gets too much heaven no more 
It's much harder to come by 
I'm waiting in line 
Nobody gets too much love anymore 
It's as high as a mountain 
And harder to climb 

Nobody gets too much heaven no more 
It's much harder to come by 
I'm waiting in line 
Nobody gets too much love anymore 
It's as high as a mountain 
And harder to climb
                        
                    |
