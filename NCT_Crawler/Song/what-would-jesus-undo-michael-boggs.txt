Ca sĩ: Michael Boggs

Would God unpreach every sermon spoke in hatred
The kind with hell fire burning on their lips
Would He unsing every sacred song of worship
We sing it but dont mean a word of it
Would he unsay every scripture said in anger
The kind that's used to hurt more than to help
Would he unpoint all the pointing words and fingers
Hold up a mirror so we can point 'em at ourselves
Oh the things we do in His name
I wonder if He shakes his head
and thinks that's not what I meant
What does hurting the hurting prove
If we're supposed to love
I wonder why we judge
when grace has graced us too
When it comes down to me and you
what would Jesus undo What would Jesus undo
Would He unkeep all the treasures that we're hoarding
oh and give a couple hungry mouths some food
Would He unbuild all the walls the church keeps building
to keep all the sinners off our pews
Oh the things we do in His name
I wonder if He shakes His head
and thinks that's not what I meant
What does hurting the hurting prove
If we're supposed to love
I wonder why we judge
when grace has graced us too
When it comes down to me and you
what would Jesus undo
Oh love doesn't keep score
love cares more for
others than it does itself
When will we realize
maybe open up our eyes and see
this ain't the way it's meant to be
I wonder if He shakes His head
and thinks "that's not what I meant
What does hurting the hurting prove
If we're supposed to love
I wonder why we judge
when grace has graced us too
If it comes down to me and you I pray we always see the truth and maybe ask a time or two
What would Jesus undo
What would Jesus undo
