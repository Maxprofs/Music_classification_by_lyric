                        (Michael Jackson)
 You can look at them coming out the walls
 You can look at them climbing out the bushes
 You can find them when the letter's bout to fall
 He be waiting with his camera on focus Everywhere you seem to turn there's a monster
 When you look up in the air there's a monster
 Paparazzi got you scared like a monster, monster, monster Too bad
 Oh-oh Hollywood, it's got you jumping like you should
 (Too bad)
 It's got you bouncing off the walls
 It's got you drunk enough to fall
 (Oh oh) Hollywood just look in the mirror
 And tell me you like, don't you, don't you like it Monster
 He's a monster (mmm...)
 He's an animal Monster (yea-eah)
 He's a monster
 He's an animal (Oh-oh-oh) He's coming at ya, coming at ya rather too fast
 Mama say, mama got you in a zig zag
 And you're running
 And you're running just to escape it
 But they're gunning for the money so they fake it Everywhere you seem to turn there's a monster
 When you look up in the air there's a monster
 When you see them in the street
 There's a monster, monster, monster (Too bad)
 (Oh-oh) Hollywood it's got you jumping like you should
 It's got you bouncing off the wall
 It's got you drunk enough to fall
 (Too bad)
 (Oh-oh) Hollywood just look in the mirror
 And tell me d'you like what you see Monster
 (he's like an animal)
 He's a monster
 (just like an animal)
 He's an animal
 (and he's moving in the air)
 Monster
 He's a monster
 He's an animal
 (everybody wanna be a star) Why are they never satisfied with an all you give, (yeh, yeh, yeh, yeah)
 You give them your all
 They're watching you fall
 They eat your soul [50 Cent]
 Catch me in a bad mood, flippin' you'll take a whippin'
 Animal, Hannibal, cannibal addition
 Tears appear, yeah, blurring your vision
 Fear in the air, screaming, your blood drippin'
 Shiver a second, now, now, now, now what is it
 Funeral's, cemeteries, don't worry it's time to visit
 Broke bones, tombstones, how do you think I'm kidding
 Its home, sweet home, the land of the forbidden
 All hail, run tell, the King has risen
 2010 Thriller, there's nothing iller, it's killer
 There vision, the missin' the pack, this is that,
 This the bomb, ring the alarm
 MJ number 1, it's goes on and on
 Its goes on and on
 We get to crippin', its running in the early morn'
 Keep on dreaming there's nowhere to run
 You can drive but you done
 I can feel it in the air, hear the monster come. [Michael Jackson]
 (Too bad)
 (Oh-oh) Hollywood it's got you jumping (like you should, girl)
 It's got you bouncing (ooh off the walls)
 It's got you drunk enough to fall
 (Too bad)
 Oh oh Hollywood
 Just making it clearer, and tell me you like
 Don't you, don't you like it Monster
 (ah-ah, say you wanna be a star)
 He's a monster
 (say you wanna go far)
 He's an animal
 (Why do you keep stalking me) Monster
 (what'd you do to me)
 He's a monster
 (why did you take, why did you fake it)
 He's an animal
 (yea-ah, why you haunting me) Monster
 (why you stalking me)
 He's a monster
 (why you haunting me)
 He's an animal
 (why'd you do it, why'd you, why you stalking me) Monster
 (why you haunting me)
 He's a monster
 (why you haunting me)
 He's an animal
 (Why did you, why did you, oh-oh-oh) He's dragging you down like a monster
 He's keeping you down like a monster He's dragging you down like a monster
 He's keeping you down like a monster
