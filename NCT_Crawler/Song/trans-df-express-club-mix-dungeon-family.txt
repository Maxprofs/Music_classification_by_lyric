 Grab your ticket

 Trans df express, trans df express
 Grab your ticket (ticket!)
 Come get wit it
 Trans df express, trans df express (oh ***!)

 [cee-lo]
 I am the one and only son of a machine gun
 Untrapable, meaning I can't be place between none
 _even in darkness_, I already ate this diction
 It's so bold you could smell that funk with a cold
 It's unbelieveable, bare a resemblance to broken mold
 I'm op-timistic, I'm the air in the open road
 Make ya move it's moderate, no need to speed
 It's inevitable you arrive in due time indeed
 Now is the, time and place to in-vade the empty space
 I'm a profectionist, I never pressure the pen space
 But I wouldn't be amazing without god's amazing grace
 I can travel outer space while standin in one place

 [andre benjamin]
 Hippy to the hop, like a digi-log frog
 Throw me the cat and I'll throw you the dog [bark]
 Simple as a dimple ain't it?
 A hole in your cheek, let's hit the town so we can paint it,
 Red -- or maybe baby blue for two
 As sure as you are my lover, that is my favorite color
 And we get down - off to my castle we drown
 In each others love we puddle, huddle - break, fourth down, and inches
 (ahh!) we all some players don't ride no benches (ahh!)
 Elegant princes come to your senses (ahh!)
 I noticed that your one of a kind
 That's makes you kind of the one
 I'm, sharing my spaghetti with --
 The lady and the tramp, the mystery the myth
 Not into runnin frames, but I got a thang for ya
 Swoosh! I will do ya, surely I adore ya

 Gipp, a 2002 boy
 What'chu think it say 2a, ya goin my way
 Went from ragtime buddy to a cakewalk stage
 Didn't ask 'cause I past you made this weight
 My empression is one and no other
 Kinda-sorta yo, dr. Demental
 Had you come through the lab
 Doctor, organized instrumental
 We gon' keep it on the track and the gristle
 This ex-press, here the whistle? [train horn]

 [backbone]
 Who the *** changed the face of the game
 And bought it back "5, deuce, 4, tre"
 The alliance of elite emcees
 Attention, salute, at ease
 The world renowned, from here clean across seas
 It's the critical acclaimed, dungeon family
 We are now boardin, all seats and all rows
 But it ain't no more tickets 'cause it's a sold-out show

 [Hook:]

 [big boi]
 I stank I can, I stank I can, I know I can, I will
 ?? Lil' p-i-t be knockin players off the field, for real
 Dungeon family got my sword and my sheild
 To campleton not camelot, let's smoke the 'dro and chill
 (chill?) like four babies, and now you want the pill
 Used to be raw dawg but now you want the grill
 Seville flawless, so now you want drill
 And takin a groupie home is just like lovin some roadkill
 Pimpin and panderin, on a level you can serve
 Ths metal, nouns, pronouns, adverbs, and verbs
 I spit the words of wordsmith, how ya gonna burst ***
 Sip-sip, sip-sip, "sippin on some syrup" like three 6
 Engine number 9 is on the grind
 Like ya molars when ya rolled and that's your backteeth bitin down
 Now open up and say it, the d to the f's the greatest
 The talented town, then tip up your drink, your head has been deflated
