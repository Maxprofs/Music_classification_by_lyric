                        Bài hát : Wavin’ Flag (Feat. Will.I.Am & David Guetta) - K'naan

When I get older, I will be stronger,
They'll call me freedom, just like a Waving Flag,
When I get older, I will be stronger,
They'll call me freedom, just like a Waving Flag,

So wave your flag
now wave your flag
now wave your flag

Born to a throne, stronger than Rome
but Violent prone, poor people zone,
But it's my home, all I have known,
Where I got grown, streets we would roam.
But out of the darkness, I came the farthest,
Among the hardest survival.
Learn from these streets, it can be bleak,
Except no defeat, surrender retreat,

So we struggling, fighting to eat and
We wondering when we'll be free,
So we patiently wait, for that fateful day,
It's not far away, so for now we say

When I get older, I will be stronger,
I make it better, Struggle no longer
When I get older, I will be stronger,
They'll call me freedom, just like a Waving Flag,

So wave your flag
now wave your flag
now wave your flag

So many wars (wars)
Settling scores (scores)
Bringing us promises, leaving us poor

And in a situation, When that's a compensation
They got no occupation, No buy no medications
See it's a combination, of no education
We can navigate, and save tommrows genetation
Cos they cant control us, nor they cant hold us down

We gon pick it up even though we still struggling
fighting to eat and
We wondering when we'll be free,
So we patiently wait [WAIT!!]
For that fateful day, [GO!!]
It's not far away, so for now we say

When I get older, I will be stronger,
I make it better, Struggle no longer
When I get older, I will be stronger,
They'll call me freedom, just like a Waving Flag,

So wave your flag
now wave your flag
now wave your flag

(Ohhhh Ohhhh Ohhhhh Ohhhh)x4

(Ohhhh Ohhhh Ohhhhh Ohhhh)
And everybody will be singing it
(Ohhhh Ohhhh Ohhhhh Ohhhh)
And you and I will be singing it
(Ohhhh Ohhhh Ohhhhh Ohhhh)
And we all will be singing it
(Ohhh Ohh Ohh Ohh)


When I get older I will be stronger(stronger x3)
They'll call me freedom, just like a Waving Flag,

So wave your flag
now wave your flag
now wave your flag
