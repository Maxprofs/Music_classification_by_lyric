When you leave my colors fade to gray
ooh-a-ooh-a-eh, ooh-a-ooh-a-eh
Every word of love I used to say
Now I paint it everyday,

Ma-Ya-Hi
Ma-Ya-Hu
Ma-Ya-Ho
Ma-Ya-Ha Ha
Ma-Ya-Hi
Ma-Ya-Hu
Ma-Ya-Ho
Ma-Ya-Ha Ha

Hello, Salute, it’s me, your babe
And I made something that’s real
To show you how I feel,

Hello, Hello, it’s me, Alina
I will paint my words of love
With your name on every wall,

When you leave my colors fade to gray.
ooh-a-ooh-a-eh, ooh-a-ooh-a-eh
Every word of love I used to say
Now I paint it everyday

When you leave my colors fade to gray
Here my love will stay but all my colors fade away
Every word of love I used to say
Now I paint it everyday

[3, 2, 1, Come On]

Ma-Ya-Hi
Ma-Ya-Hu
Ma-Ya-Ho
Ma-Ya-Ha Ha
Ma-Ya-Hi
Ma-Ya-Hu
Ma-Ya-Ho
Ma-Ya-Ha Ha

I sold my strings, my song, and dreams
And I buy some paints to match the colors of my love

Hello, Hello, it’s me Alina
I will paint my words of my love
With your name on every wall.

[Bass Jump, Higher]

When you leave my colors fade to gray.
ooh-a-ooh-a-eh, ooh-a-ooh-a-eh
Every word of love I used to say
Now I paint it everyday

When you leave my colors fade to gray
Hey my love will stay but all my colors fade away
Every word of love I used to say
Now I paint it everyday 

Ma ya hi...hu...ho...hahhah
