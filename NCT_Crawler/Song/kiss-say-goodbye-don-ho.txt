                        Do we have to say "good-bye" 
With a kiss that will break our hearts 
Where have all the love have gone? 
Yet it's hard to believe us apart. 
So, please, don't leave me! 
I want you back in my arms again 
Just for a moment girl 
I want to feel your trembling lips again. 
Let's this kiss good-bye 
The end is charged-in near 
Let me feel the warmth of your love again 
Knew we have to part knew it from start 
Why do our love always end this way? 
Let's just kiss and say "good-bye", girl! 
Break my heart to see us end this way, girl! 
Though we have to go away now it hurts cause love can't stay. 
Kiss and say "good-bye" 
Nothing can be right 
Why do we have to end this way, girl? 
Hard to say "good-bye", everything's not right 
So, let's just: kiss and say "good-bye", love.
