                        Bài hát: We Are Powerful - Lenka

We are invincible, we are unique
 We are incredible, we are free 
We are beautiful, we are a dream
 We are wonderful, you and me

We are powerful 
We are powerful

We fell in love on the same dark night
When the moon was high and the stars were bright
We stood still while the world turned 'round
and we knew then that we are powerful

We are powerful
We are powerful

We are magnetic, we are bold
We are electric, we won't grow old
We are mysterious, we are wise
We are adventurous, you and I

We are powerful
We are powerful

We fell in love on the same dark night
When the moon was high and the stars were bright
We stood still while the world turned 'round
and we knew then that we are powerful

We are powerful
We are powerful

We fell in love on the same dark night
When the moon was high and the stars were bright
We stood still while the world turned 'round
and we knew then that we are powerful
We are powerful

We are powerful
We are powerful

We fell in love on the same dark night
When the moon was high and the stars were bright
We stood still while the world turned 'round
and we knew then that we are powerful

We are powerful
We are powerful
