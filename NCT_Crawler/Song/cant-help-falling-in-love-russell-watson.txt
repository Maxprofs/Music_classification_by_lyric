                        Wise men say only fools rush in
 But I can't help falling in love with you
 Shall I say would it be a sin
 If I can't help falling in love with you
 Like a river flows (Oh)
 To the sea (Oh)
 So it goes
 Some things are meant to be Take my hand (take my hand)
 Take my whole life too (life too)
 For I can't help falling in love with you Like a river flows (Oh)
 To the sea (Oh)
 So it goes
 Some things are meant to be
 Take my hand (take my hand)
 Take my whole life too (life too)
 for I can't help falling in love with you
 For I can't help falling in love with you
