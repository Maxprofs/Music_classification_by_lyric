                        A little faith
Brightens a rainy day
Life is difficult you can't go away
Don't hide yourselves in the corner
You have my place to stay

Sorrow is gonna say goodbye
Opens up
You'll see the happy sunshine
Keep going on with your dream
Chasing tomorrow's sunrise
The spirit can never die

Sun will shine my friend
Won't let you cry my dear
Seeing you shed a tear
Make my world disappear
You'll never be alone in darkness

See my smile my friend
We are with you holding hands
You have got to believe
You are my destiny
We've meant to be your friends
That's what a friend should be
                        
                    |
