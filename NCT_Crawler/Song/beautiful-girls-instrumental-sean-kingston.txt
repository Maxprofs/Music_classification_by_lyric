                        Song: Beautiful Girls (Instrumental) - Sean Kingston

Jr! Sean Kingston!

 You're way too beautiful girl
 That's why it will never work
 You had me suicidal, suicidal
 When you say it's over

 Damn all these beautiful girls
 They only wanna do you dirt
 They'll have you suicidal, suicidal
 When they say it's over

 See it started at the park, used to chill after dark
 Oh, when you took my heart, that's when we fell apart
 Cuz we both thought, that love could last forever
 (Last forever)
 They say we're too young, to get ourselves sprung
 Oh we didn't care, we made it very clear
 And they also said, that we couldn't last together
 (Last together)
 See it's very define, you're one of a kind
 But you're much on my mind, you often get decline
 Oh lord my baby you're driving me crazy

 You're way too beautiful girl
 That's why it will never work
 You had me suicidal, suicidal
 When you say it's over
 Damn all these beautiful girls
 They only wanna do you dirt
 They'll have you suicidal, suicidal
 When they say it's over

 It was back in 99, watching movies all the time
 Oh when I went away for doing my first crime
 And I never thought, that we was gonna see each other
 (See each other)
 And then I came out, mommy move me down south
 Oh I'm with my girl who I thought was my world
 It came out to me, that she wasn't the girl for me
 See it's very define, you're one of a kind
 But you're much on my mind, you often get decline
 Oh lord my baby you're driving me crazy

 You're way too beautiful girl
 That's why it will never work
 You had me suicidal, suicidal
 When you say it's over
 Damn all these beautiful girls
 They only wanna do you dirt
 They'll have you suicidal suicidal
 When they say it's over

 Now we are fussing and now we are fighting
 Please tell me why, I'm feeling slighted
 And I don't know, how to make it better
 (Make it better)
 You're dating other guys, you're telling me lies
 Oh I can't believe what I'm seeing with my eyes
 I'm losing my mind, and I don't think it's clever
 (Think it's clever)

 You're way too beautiful girl
 That's why it will never work
 You had me suicidal, suicidal
 When you say it's over
 Damn all these beautiful girls
 They only wanna do you dirt
 They'll have you suicidal... Suicidal
