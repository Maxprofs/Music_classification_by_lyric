                        Can't Stop Love
We stand here today, together as one
You brighten my days,
just like the sun
When everything around,
is like stormy weather,
We always survive,
cause were in this together

Whoever said that we could never hold on,
Do now know I found my star
(Baby you are my star)
And now I'm happy I stood up for so long
And baby this is where our story starts

I can't stop,
can't stop this love
No matter what they say,
I love you
I can't stop, can't stop,
I love you no matter what they say, I love you
They said this love was the impossible kind
But we were strong enough to fight for this life
I can't stop,
can't stop this love
No matter what they say,
I love you

Now i'm carried away because I've opened arms
You're here to stay,
deep in my heart
They said that we couldn't, but we did make it work
And nothing could stop us, not even two different worlds

Whoever said that we could never hold on,
Do now know I found my star
(Baby you are my star)
And now I'm happy I stood up for so long
And baby this is where our story starts

I can't stop,
can't stop this love
No matter what they say,
I love you
I can't stop, can't stop,
I love you no matter what they say, I love you
They said this love was the impossible kind
But we were strong enough to fight for this life
I can't stop,
can't stop this love
No matter what they say,
I love you

I can't stop, stop,
No i can't stop
I can't stop, stop,
No i can't stop...

I can't stop,
can't stop this love
No matter what they say,
I love you
I can't stop, can't stop,
I love you no matter what they say, I love you
They said this love was the impossible kind
But we were strong enough to fight for this life
I can't stop,
can't stop this love
No matter what they say,
I love you
