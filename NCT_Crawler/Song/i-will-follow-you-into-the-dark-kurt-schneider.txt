                        Love of mine,
someday you'll die,
I'll be close behind
I'll follow you into the dark

No blinding light or tunnels to gates of while
just our hands clasped so tight
waiting for the hint of a spark

If Heaven and Hell decide 
that they both are satisfied
illuminate the NO's on their vacancy signs
If there's no one beside you
when your soul embarks
then I'll follow you into the dark

In Cathelic school as vicious as Roman rule
I got my knuckles bruised 
by a lady in black
And I held my tongue
as she told me "Son
fear is the heart of love"
so I never went back

If Heaven and Hell decide 
that they both are satisfied
illuminate the NO's on their vacancy signs
If there's no one beside you
when your soul embarks
then I'll follow you into the dark

I'll follow you into the dark
                        
                    |
