                        Bài hát: La La La (Pretty Sister Who Buys Me Food OST) - Rachael Yamagata

When the night falls 
and the rest of the world 
quiets down
I come running to you 
and there you sing me a song
La La La La La La La
The little sweet melody
La La La La
Oh how I wish 
it would never end
Turn off the light dear
Let me sink beneath 
the waves of your heart
And then 
comes the light in darkness 
glowing through the night
Has the rain stopped
Is the daybreak yet to come
But why should I be worried
When I am here with you now
La La La La La La La
The little sweet melody
La La La La La La
How I wish 
it would never end
La La La La La La La
I love your sweet melody
La La La 
How I wish 
it would never end
It seems so unreal
But it is not untrue
Come away with me
Leave it all behind
                        
                    |
