                        A lot of people ask me
 Where the *** I've been at the last few years
 *** I don't know
 But I do know - I'm back now (haha)

 Here comes the rain and thunder now
 Nowhere to run, to run to now
 I'll disappear, you'll wonder how
 Looking for me, I'm underground (x2)

 Dre, I'm down here under the ground
 Dig me up, broken tibias fibias yeah fix me up
 60 s***s, all of them dying from Asphyxia
 After they sip piss through Christopher Reeves sippy cup
 Dixie cups, toxins, boxes of oxipads
 Enough oxi-cotton to send a ***ing ox to rehab
 Whack job in a bag and a black stalking cap
 Jacking off to a hockey mask at a boxing match (he can't say that)
 Yes he can, I just did faggot, now guess again
 Better text message your next of kin,
 Tell em s***s about to get extra messy especially when I flex again
 Throw a ***ing lesbian into wetzy men
 Faggidy, faggidy, fagidy, ragidy ann and andy, no!
 Ragidy, andy and andy no! It can't be, it can't be
 Yes it can be, the ***ing anti-christ is back danny and satan in black satin panties
 This is amity ville, calamity god damn it insanity pills fanny pack filled with zanies
 Through every nook and cranny looking for trannies
 Milk and cookies spilled on my silk Negligee lookie
 Razor-ba-lades with me to make you b-leed,
 Cases of maybelline make-up laying on the table with weed
 Slim shady, *** sounds like a fable to me
 Until he jumps out of the ***ing toilet when you're taking a pee.

 Here comes the rain and thunder now
 Nowhere to run, to run to now
 I'll disappear, you'll wonder how
 Looking for me, I'm underground (x2)

 Six semen samples, 17 strands of hair
 Found at the back of a van after the shoot with Vanity Fare
 Hannah Montana prepare to elope with a can opener
 And be cut open like a cantaloupe and canopy beds
 Glad bags, yeah glad to be back, because last year was a tragedy
 That landed me smack dabin rehab
 *** doctor, I didn't understand a damn what he said
 I planned to relapse the second I walked out of that bitch
 Two weeks in brightened, I ain't enlightened
 Biting into a ***ing vicadin like I'm a viking
 Oh! Lighten the striken, might be a ***in' sign a need a psychic
 Evaluation, *** Jason its Friday the 19th
 That means is just a regular day
 And this is the kind of *** I think of a regular-lay
 *** lesbians should have had her legs in the way
 Now she's pregnant and gay, missing both legs and begging to stay.

 Here comes the rain and thunder now
 Nowhere to run, to run to now
 I'll disappear, you'll wonder how
 Looking for me, I'm underground (x2)

 Tell the critics I'm back and I'm coming
 Spit it back in abundance
 Hit a fag with onions and split a bag of fonions
 Mad at me understandable, cannibal shooting animal,
 Light up a cannon and have him catapult adding a dog!
 Captain of a cult, with an elite following to turn Halloween back
 Into a trick or treat holiday
 Have Micheal Myers looking like a liar, swipe his powers
 Replace his knife with flowers and a stack of fliers
 Hit Jason Forbes with 40's
 Stuck a expository up his ass and made him tell me a story
 Gave Hannibal Lector a ***ing nectarine
 Sat him in a ***ing fruit and vegetable section and gave him a lecture
 Walked up elm street with a ***ing wifflebat drew
 Fought Freddy Krueger and Edward Scissor Hands too
 Came out with a little scratch, ooh
 Looking like a got in a ***ing pillow fight with a triple fat goose
 Insanity, can it be panity, where is the humanity
 And having a twisted fantasy with an arm and leg amputee
 Straight jacket with a hundred eight brackets
 With a strap that wraps twice around my back, then they latch it
 Cut your ***ing head off and ask you where your headed off to,
 Get it, headed off to? (haha)
 Medic this headache's awful
 This anesthetic's pathetic
 So's this diabetic waffle
 And this prosthetic arm keeps crushing my hard taco

 Here comes the rain and thunder now
 Nowhere to run, to run to now
 I'll disappear, you'll wonder how
 Looking for me, I'm underground (x2)

 (Talking)
 So, it wasn't a choice, it was I had to do this.
 And now I got 90 days clean and uh, that's all I have to share, Thanks.

 Thanks for sharing Brian, is there anyone else
 Who would like to share this evening?

 Yeah I got something to share-
 When you walked through the door you were queer to me
 So come here baby boy, just come here to me
 You're a c*** boy, everybody wants you
 You're gayer than you would ever claim to
 I won't have to rape you
 So homie lay down down down
 Lay down down down
 Lay down down down
 Lay down lay down

 Where's everybody going?
 This always went over real big in gay a
 Ok wait, I got another one

 I just love condoms and lots of c**
 No?
 Oh ***.
