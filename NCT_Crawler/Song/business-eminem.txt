Marshall!
Marshall!
Bitches and Gentleman!
It's showtime!
Hurry, hurry step right up!
Introducin' the star of our show, his name is...
Marshall!
You wouldn't wanna be anywhere else in the world right now
So without futher ado, I bring to you...
Marshall!
Your bout to witness hip hop in its
Most pourest, most rawest form, flow almost flawless
Most hardest, most honest, known artist
Chip off the old block but old doc is BACK!
Looks like Batman, brought his own Robin
Oh God, Sadam's got his own Laden
With his own private plane, his own pilot
Set to blow college dorm room doors off the hinges
Oranges, peach, pairs, plums, oranges

My inches away from you, here fear none
Hip hop is in a state of 911, so
Let's get down to business
I don't got no time to play around what is this?
Must be a circus in town, let's shut the *** down
On these clowns, can I get a witness?
Hell Yeah!
Dre gotta move fast, gotta perform miracles
Gee willikers Dre, holly bat syllables
Look at all the bull*** that goes on in Gotham
When I'm gone time to get rid of these rap criminals
So, skip to your lou, while I do what I do best
You ain't even impressed no more, you used to it
Flows too wet, nobody close to it
Nobody says it was till everyone knows the ***
The most hated on outta all those who say it hate it
On an eighties songs and
exaggerate it all so much
they make it all up
There's no such thing
Like a female with good looks who cooks and cleans
It just means so much more to so much more
People when you rappin' and you know what for
The show must go on, so I'd like to welcome ya'll
To Marshall and Andre's carnival
C'mon! Now..
It's just like old times, the dynamic duo
Two old friends, why panic?
You allready know whos capable, the two caped heroes
Dial straight down the center 8-0-0
You can even call collect, the most feared duet
Since me and Elton, play career Russian Roulette
And never even seen me blingin' get me bustin' a sweat
People steppin' over people just to rush to the set
Just to get to see a MC who breathes so freely
Ease over these beats, and be so breezy
Jesus, how can *** be so easy
How can one Chandra be so Levy
Turn on these beats MC's dont see me
Believe me, BET and MTV
Are gonna grieve when we leave, dawg fo sheezy
Can't leave rap alone the game needs me
'Til we grow beards, get weird and disappear into the mountains
Nothin' but clowns down here
But we, ain't fuckin' around 'round here
Yo Dre!
Has come to save the day
Back with his friend Andre
And to remind you that bull*** does not pay
Because
And Andre are here to stay and never go away
Until our dying day, until we're old and grey
So until next time friends
Same blonde hair, same rap channel
Goodnight everyone, thank you for coming
Your host for the evening
