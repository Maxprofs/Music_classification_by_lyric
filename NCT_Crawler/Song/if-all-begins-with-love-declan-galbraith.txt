                        Rain has to fall if the flower is to grow
And the night has to come if the moonlight is to glow

And although my eyes may cry a thousand tears
In the end I'm sure they'll fill with laughter
And if by chance I live a million years
I believe one thing thing will still be true

chorus:
In love I'll find the answer
To the question
That is written in my heart
Have faith and it will guide me
On my journey
If I remember from the start
It all begins with love
It all begins with love

The river has to bend on it's journey to the sea
And the tide has to turn if the ocean is to breathe

maybe I will search this world a hundred times
Or maybe I'll find my dream tomorrow
but somewhere deep within this heart of mine
I believe one thing will still be true

chorus:
In love I'll find the answer
To the question
That is written in my heart
Have faith and it will guide me
On my journey
If I remember from the start
It all begins with love
It all begins with love, with love, with love

chorus:
In love I'll find the answer
To the question
That is written in my heart
Have faith and it will guide me
On my journey
If I remember from the start
It all begins with love
It all begins with love
It all begins with love
It all begins with love
                        
                    |
