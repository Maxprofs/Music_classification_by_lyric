                        Bài hát: I Choose You - Keyshia Cole

So many things he does for me
Such a provider he cares for me
Wish I could give him all of me
But I can't, can't let you go
I tried hating you, but I just love you more
Compared him to you, but he can't match your score
In this game of love, there's no rules
When it comes to us, I choose you.

[Chorus:]
If it ain't you, it's not worth it
No matter what I do, nothing's working
Baby I know love's not perfect
Even if he gives me the world it'll never be enough
Cause I choose you
I choose you
And if it ain't you
Then it's just not worth it

[Verse 2:]
I heard you found you another
But she's not me, how could you love her?
We've got history, we were meant to be
She can't replace what we had based on chemistry
I tried hating you but I just love you more
Don't care what she do
She could never match my score
In this game of love, there's no rules
When it comes to us, I choose you.

[Chorus:]
If it ain't you, it's not worth it
No matter what I do, nothing's working
Baby I know love's not perfect
Even if he gives me the world it'll never be enough
Cause I choose you
I choose you
And if it ain't you
Then it's just not worth it

[Bridge:]
Can't give up
I'm a keep on trying
To get your love
No sense in denying
You had my heart
I'm not over you
Whatever it takes I'm gon' do.

[Chorus:]
If it ain't you, it's not worth it
No matter what I do, nothing's working
Baby I know love's not perfect
Even if he gives me the world it'll never be enough
Cause I choose you
I choose you
And if it ain't you
Then it's just not worth it
                        
                    |
