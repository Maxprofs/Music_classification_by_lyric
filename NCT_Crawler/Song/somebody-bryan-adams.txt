Bryan Adams--Somebody

I bin lookin' for someone
Between the fire and the flame
We're all lookin' for somethin'
To ease the pain
Now who can you turn to
When it's all black and white
And the winners are losers
You see it every night
I need somebody
Somebody like you
Everybody needs somebody
I need somebody
Hey what about you
Everybody needs somebody
When you're out on the front line
And you're watchin' them fall
It doesn't take long to realize
It ain't worth fightin' for
I thought I saw the Madonna
When you walked in the room
And they cut right through
oh they cut right through
I need somebody
Somebody like you
Everybody needs somebody
I need somebody
Hey what about you
We all need somebody
Another night another lesson learned
It's the distance keeps us sane
But when the silence leads to sorrow
We do it all again - all again
I need somebody
Somebody like you
Everybody needs somebody
