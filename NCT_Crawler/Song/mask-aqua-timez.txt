                        Bài hát: Mask - Aqua Timez

Kizu hitotsu nai kokoro ga doko ni aru no darou ka
Kubimoto wo toorisugiru kaze ni tazunerareta
Mattou na kotae nante mochiawasete wa inai
Hitori hitotsu no inochi iki iki to ikiru dake

Where can I find a heart that doesn't have a single wound?
I was asked by the wind as it blew past my neck.
I don't have a good answer to this question.
People, with just one life, are trying their best to thrive.

Sukoshi dake ao sugita haru ni uchinomesarete
Onaji natsu no hikari wo tomo ni kakiwakete kita
Kimi no eranda michi ni maemuki sa yo, habikore
Mata itsuka tomoshi aemasu you ni

After we were slightly buffeted by the overly green spring,
together we pushed through summer's radiance.
On the path you have chosen, I hope positivity would spread
so that we could light each other's way again someday.

"Kumorazu ni ikite hoshii dakara ame wo kirawanai de"
"Uso wa tsukazu ni ite hoshii sabishiku naru dake dakara"

"I want you to live without any dark cloud, so don't hate this temporary rain."
"I want you to live without having to lie; loneliness is nothing to fret about."

Kimi no karada wa sono uchigawa ni ai wo hisomasete hakobu tame ni arunda
Zutto zutto umareta hi kara zutto
Boku mo kimi no kare mo dare mo minna kotoba ni dekizu samayotterunda
Itsuka itsuka todokerareru you ni tte

Your body exists for the purpose of carrying the love concealed within,
forever, and ever, from the day you were born.
You, I, he, and everyone else, are all wandering without being able to say anything.
We only hope that one day, eventually, our words would reach their destination.

Hito no wa ni hairisobire dou suru koto mo dekizu
Kodoku to iu kyoten de kisetsu wo kikaeru dake
Gyakufuu ni dakare nagara iki taeteku negai wa
Sorezore ga motsu omoi no naka ni dake sumitsuku

Unable to fit ourselves into society, we are left powerless.
From a base named loneliness, we see off one season after another.
The wish to perish slowly in the counter-current's embrace
will only settle in the thoughts we each cling to.

Koko de wa nai dokoka ni nigete shimaitakutte
Jibun ja nai dareka ni natte shimaitakutte
Toriaezu haritsuketa egao no ichimai oku
Hito wa nani wo hoshigaru no darou

We want to escape somewhere else other than our current location.
We want to become someone else other than our current self.
For the time being we have put on a smiling mask.
Just what do people truly desire?

Nesobetta shibafu no ue sukoshi dake naita ato ni
DOONATSU no ana kara nozoku sora ga amari ni aokute kondo wa omoikiri naita

Lying sprawled on the grass, after I have wept a little,
I peeked from a donut's hole, saw a beautifully cerulean sky, and cried to my heart's content.

TAIMU MASHIN ga nakutatte iinda ima wo daiji ni dekitara iinda
Kedo kedo koukai wo tebanasezu
Itsuka yorisou tame ni hitori ni natta hitotsu ni naru tame kakera ni natte
Sou sa sou da yo
Isshou no uchi ni ma ni au you ni tte

I don't need a time machine. I only need to treasure my present time.
But, but, unable to let go of my regrets,
I became alone while trying to find someone else, became pieces while trying to become whole.
Yes, that's right,
I hope I can make it in time within my lifetime.

Kimi ga kureta ano omoi ni kirei na namae nado nakute mo
Kimi ga kureta ano omoi wa kioku no sora wo maitsuzukeru

Even if there are no pretty names for the thoughts you gave me,
those thoughts will still dance nimbly in the sky of memories.

"Kumorazu ni ikite hoshii dakara ame wo kirawanai de" to
"Uso wa tsukazu ni ite hoshii sabishiku naru dake dakara" to

"I want you to live without any dark cloud, so don't hate this temporary rain."
"I want you to live without having to lie; loneliness is nothing to fret about."

Boku no naka de maigo ni natta kodoku wo kimi wa sagashi dashite dakishimete kureta
Mou ne naite iinda yo tte
Korae kireru you ni natte shimatte kanashii no ni nakenakatta
Boku zutto boku zutto nakitakattanda naa

You found and embraced the loneliness within me when I had lost my way,
and told me that it would be fine for me to cry now.
I trained myself to hold in my tears no matter how sad I might feel.
But for all this time, I have always wanted to cry.

Kokoro ni mo kabusenai de omoikiri waraitakattanda

I have always wanted to smile freely, without having to put a mask over my heart.
                        
                    |
