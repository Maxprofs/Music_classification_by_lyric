                        You think love’s a game
Love is a motion 
Endless and so deep
Always emotion I've got many ways
To reach tomorrow
Love will always grow
No pain, no sorrow 

When you take me in your arms
You can break me with your heart
I feel the magic of your charm
Oh you're tearing me apart

Midnight lady love takes time
Midnight lady it's hard to find
Midnight lady I call your name
I know you can ease my pain

Midnight lady just you and me
Midnight lady eternally
Midnight lady I can fly
In your arms I'll get high

Magic touched my life
I'm still dreaming
Anything before has lost its meaning
Heaven in your eyes
My soul is on fire
Oh my feelings grow we can't go higher

Oh I just want a girl
Baby just to call my own
And I just wanna dream
I don't have to dream alone.
