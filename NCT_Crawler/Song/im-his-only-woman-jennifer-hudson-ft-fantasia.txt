                        song : I'm His Only Woman - Jennifer Hudson, Fantasia

Hello? Hello, can I speak to Jennifer, please?
 Yes, this is Jennifer, may I ask who's calling?
 Hi Jennifer, I'm Tony's girlfriend
 I don't mean to call on that disrespectful stuff like Wait a minute, Tony's girlfriend?
 Apparently you got the wrong number
 Because I'm Tony's woman, his only woman that is Well, obviously that's what he's been telling you
 But I'm calling right now to formally introduce myself
 My name is Fantasia, did you just say introduce yourself?
 Yeah Well, I don't need no introduction
 I am his woman and I am Jennifer Hudson
 If this was ten years ago I'd be at your front door
 Ready to whoop your ass but you know what I'm too grown for that
 I ain't got nothing else to say I'm his only woman, his woman
 And you can't break up this home
 You can say what you want
 This is my man, get your own After all these years I spent, must have been close to ten
 You can't mean the same to him especially when that's my man
 Baby now that he's with you tell me why he calls me boo
 Guess he played you like a fool, I think he's lying to you Oh, I'm just tryna talk to you baby, woman to woman
 Like two adults not tryna start no commotion
 But the man you claim is yours says he's mine and he loves me too
 Same promises to you, the honest truth, guess we both are fools Seems that you're the one who's calling me
 Oh, he belongs to me, only me and only me
 This situation you don't want no confrontation with, with me boo
 I don't know what he's telling you
 But it seems to me that you're confused I'm his only woman, his woman, yeah
 And what you're saying to me I don't care
 I'm not tryna go back and forth
 Simply you're not welcome over here After all these years I spent, must have been close to ten
 You can't mean the same to him especially when that's my man
 Baby now that he's with you tell me why he calls me boo
 I guess he's lying, lying to you I can't believe it, can't believe it
 The same man that I knew when he lived with his mama
 The same damn man who car note that I paid
 Who bed that I made so you better believe After all the years I spent, must have been close to ten
 You can't mean the same to him especially when he's my man
 Baby now if he's with you tell me why he calls me boo
 Guess he lied to me and he's lying to you
