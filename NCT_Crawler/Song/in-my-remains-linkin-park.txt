                        Separate, sifting through the wreckage 
I cant concentrate, searching for a message 
in that fear and pain, broken down and waiting for 
a chance to feel alive.

Now In my Remains! Are Promises that never came
So thats violence way, to wash away the worst of me

Come apart, falling in the cracks of every broken heart
Digging through the wreckage of your disregard
sinking down and waiting for a chance to feel alive 

Now In my Remains! Are Promises that never came
So thats violence way, to wash away the worst of me

Like an army falling one by one by one
Like an army falling one by one by one
Like an army falling one by one by one
Like an army falling one by one by one


Now In my Remains!(one by one, one by one)
Are Promises that never came (One by one by one)
So thats violence way (one by one, one by one)
to wash away the worst of me (one by one by one)

Like an army falling (one by one, one by one)
one by one by one

Like an army falling one by one by one
                        
                    |
