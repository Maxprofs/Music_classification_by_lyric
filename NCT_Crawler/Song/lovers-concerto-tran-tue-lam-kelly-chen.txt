                        Bài hát: Lover's Concerto - Kelly Chen (Trần Tuệ Lâm)

How gentle is the rain 
That falls softly on the meadow 
Birds high up in the trees 
Serenade the clouds with their melody. 

Oh....!How gentle is the rain 
That falls softly on the meadow 
Birds high up in the trees 
Serenade the clouds with their melody. 

Oh....! See there beyond the hills 
The bright colors of the rainbow 
Some magic from above 
Made this day for us 
Just to fall in love. 

You hold me in your arms 
And say once again you love me 
And if your love is true 
Everything will be just as wonderful! 

Now, I belong to you 
From this day until forever 
Just love me tenderly 
And I'll give to you 
Every part of me. 

Oh! Don't ever make me cry 
Through long lonely nights without love 
Be always true to me 
Keep this day in your heart eternally. 

You hold me in your arms 
And say once again you love me 
And if your love is true 
Everything will be just as wonderful!
                        
                    |
