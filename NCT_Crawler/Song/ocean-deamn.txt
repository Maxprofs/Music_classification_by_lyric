[Verse]
Don’t break me down, baby
I’m losing my mind now, baby
I've been tryin' so hard, yeah
To find a way to your heart (to your heart)

[Pre-Chorus]
Maybe I’m crazy
Maybe I’m lonely
Maybe I hate you, baby
Maybe I love you

[Chorus]
I’ll tell you all my secrets
My walls are caving in
You’re playing on my weakness
I want to breathe you in

My love is like the ocean
Your love is like a dream
I give you my devotion
So, baby, please, talk to me

[Drop]
So, baby, please, talk to me

[Verse]
Don’t break me down, baby
I’m losing my mind now, baby
I've been tryin' so hard, yeah
To find a way to your heart (to your heart)

[Pre-Chorus]
Maybe I’m crazy
Maybe I’m lonely (lonely)
Maybe I hate you, baby
Maybe I love you (love you)

[Drop]
So, baby, please, talk to me

[Bridge]
My love is like the ocean
So, baby, please, talk to me (talk to me)
Maybe I love you

My love is like the ocean
So, baby, please, talk to me (talk to me)
Maybe I love you

[Chorus]
I’ll tell you all my secrets
So, baby, please, talk to me
You’re playing on my weakness
My devotion
Baby, please, talk to me

[Drop]
My love is like the ocean
Please, talk to me
Please, talk to me

My love is like the ocean
Please, talk to me
Maybe I love you

[Outro]
Maybe I love you
Maybe I love you
Maybe I love you
Baby, please, talk to me
