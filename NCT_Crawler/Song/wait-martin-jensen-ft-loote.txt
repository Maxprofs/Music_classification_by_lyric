                        Bài hát: Wait - Martin Jensen, Loote

When times are hard 
Feels out of place 
Our fading love takes us back to yesterday 
The bed is cold 
From our mistakes 
Sheets so empty though we never liked the space 
Woke up I'm half drunk 

Got a feeling we ain't done 
Cause anywhere you run 
No one's gonna know you better 
Cause I was your first one 
Back when we were so young 
You can go and have your fun 
I know you'll still wake up together 

Wa-a-a-ait I'll sta-a-a-ay 
I'll ho-old you everyday, everday I 
Wa-a-a-ait I'll sta-a-a-ay 
I to-old you everyday, everyday I'll wait (drop) 
Everyday I'll wait (still in the drop :v) 
Everyday I'll wait (still in the drop :vv) 
Everyday I'll wait (still in the drop :v) 
Everyday, everyday I'll wait 

We're trapped inside 
These paper walls 
Side by side still together we're apart 
All these years 
The high and lows 
All we know is us now we can't let it go 
Woke up I'm half drunk 

Got a feeling we ain't done 
Cause anywhere you run 
No one's gonna know you better 
Cause I was your first one 
Back when we were so young 
You can go and have your fun 
I know we'll still wake up together (drop) 
Everyday I'll wait (still in the drop :v) 
Everyday I'll wait (still in the drop :vv) 
Everyday I'll wait (still in the drop :v) 
Everyday, everyday I'll wait
