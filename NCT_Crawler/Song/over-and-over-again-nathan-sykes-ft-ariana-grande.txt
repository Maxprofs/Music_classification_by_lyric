                        Bài hát: Over And Over Again - Nathan Sykes, Ariana Grande

From the way you smile
To the way you look
You capture me
Unlike no other
From the first hello
Yeah, that's all it took
And suddenly
We had each other

And I won't leave you
Always be true
One plus one, two for life
Over and over again

So don't ever think I need more
I've got the one to live for
No one else will do
And I'm telling you
Just put your heart in my hands
I promise it won't get broken
We'll never forget this moment
Yeah we'll stay brand new
'Cause I'll love you
Over and over again
Over and over again

[Ariana Grande:]
From the heat of night
To the break of day
I'll keep you safe
And hold you forever
And the sparks will fly
They will never fade
And every day gets better and better

And I won't leave you
Always be true
One plus one, two for life
Over and over again

[Nathan Sykes:]
So don't ever think I need more
I've got the one to live for
No one else will do
Yeah I'm telling you
Just put your heart in my hands

[Both:]
I promise it won't get broken
We'll never forget this moment
Yeah we'll stay brand new
'Cause I'll love you
Over and over again
Over and over again

[Both:]
Girl when I'm with you
I lose track of time
When I'm without you
You're stuck on my mind
I'll be all you need
Until the day that I die
I'll love you
Over and over again

[Both:]
So don't ever think I need more
I've got the one to live for
No one else will do
I'm telling you

Just put your heart in my hands
I promise it won't get broken
We'll never forget this moment
Yeah we'll stay brand new
'Cause I'll love you
Over and over again
Over and over again

Over and over again
