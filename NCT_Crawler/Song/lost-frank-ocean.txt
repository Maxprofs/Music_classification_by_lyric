                        Double D
 Big full breast on my baby (yo we goin' to Florida)
 Triple weight
 Couldn't weigh the love I've got for the girl
 And I just wanna know
 Why you ain't been goin' to work
 Boss ain't workin' ya like this
 He can't take care of you like this Now you're lost
 Lost in the heat of it all
 Girl you know you're lost
 Lost in the thrill of it all
 Miami, Amsterdam
 Tokyo, Spain, lost
 Los Angeles, India
 Lost on a train, lost Got on my butter cream (There we go) silk shirt and it's Versace (Wanna buy them Prototypes)
 Hand me my triple weight
 So I can weigh the work I got on your girl(Too weird to live, too rare to die)
 No I don't really wish
 I don't wish the titties was yours
 No, have I ever
 Have I ever let you get caught? Lost
 Lost in the heat of it all
 Girl you know you're lost
 Lost in the thrill of it all
 Miami, Amsterdam
 Tokyo, Spain, lost
 Los Angeles, India
 Lost on a train, lost She's at a stove (who?)
 Can't believe I got her out here cookin' dope (Cookin' dope)
 I promise she'll be
 Whippin' meals up for a family of her own some day
 Nothin' wrong (Nothin' wrong, ain't nothin' wrong)
 No nothin' wrong with lie
 Nothin' wrong with another short plane ride (Nothin' wrong)
 Through the sky (Up in the sky)
 You and I (Just you and I) are lost Lost
 Lost in the heat of it all
 Girl you know you're lost
 Lost in the thrill of it all
 Miami, Amsterdam
 Tokyo, Spain, lost
 Los Angeles, India
 Lost on a train, lost Love lost, lost
 Love love,
 Love lost, lost
 Love love
 Love lost
 Love love
 Love lost
