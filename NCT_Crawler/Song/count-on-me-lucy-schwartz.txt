                        Yesterday wasn't easy, made a wish by the bay and it's hard to give all away
 Lift your head up really hear me, when the water is rising and you can't close your eyes or breathe Chorus
 Trust in me to make it better
 We can carry through to the end
 We'll get free from stormy weather
 Can count on me I'll be your friend Suddenly it gets clearer
 With your hands on the wheel we can turn interfere the crowd
 Better days are drawing nearer
 And there's no way, no how, and no body to stop us now [Chorus] Do, do, do do do do,
 Do, do do do darling you can count on me
 Hey, hey, hey
 Do, do, do do do do,
 Do, do do do I'll be there whenever you need me
 Hey, hey, hey
 Wherever you are
 I'm not very far
 I'll be by your side
 To make it alright [Chorus]
                        
                    |
