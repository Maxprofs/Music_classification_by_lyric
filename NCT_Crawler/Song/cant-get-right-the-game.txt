R&B/Hip Hop/Rap|

                        I bought Ether, bought Takeover
 Seein’ Jay and Nas on stage was hip-hop’s makeover
 And that very day you knew niggas was born
 Tyler the Creator, Drake, J Coles, and Big Seans
 Time for the world to pay homage
 Bow to the rap gods or them K’s vomit
 *** you know about Dipset you little dip***
 If you ain’t ***, then you ain’t get your dick wet
 I see your little chain
 I see your little dreads tryin’ to be a Lil Wayne, ***
 I used to wanna be a little Hov
 Started with a little rock, got me a little stove
 Made a little money, bought me a little rose
 Paid cash money like I was from Hollygrove
 Sold ten mill, everybody know my name now
 Thinkin’ back, it’s a mother***in’ shame how
 Biggie got killed and Pac got murked
 Sometimes I gotta step in the church, cause I ain’t tryin’ to go to hell
 As the blood spills from my pen
 It’s time to confess my sins, cause I ain’t tryin’ to go to hell
 I smoke weed, pop pills, but I’m thinkin’ it’s time for me to chill
 Cause I ain’t tryin’ to go to hell
 I’m triyin’ to get some head tonight, have a stripper in my bed tonight
 But I ain’t tryin’ to go to hell

 Father forgive me, cause I ain’t perfect
 No, no no no
 Why is everything wrong?
 Oh I can’t get it right, I always try to get it right

 Dre promised me records, I never got ‘em
 That’s why I had nightmares that a nigga shot him
 For all my albums missed records
 Felt he ***ted on me for Kendrick, recorded *** records
 And Kendrick, my nigga, put him on his first mixtape
 I pop champaign when I heard he was with Dre
 And I’m tellin’ y’all this true story cause I’m real
 Dre, first time, he ain’t ’bout it, wonder how he feel
 Cause I feel like *** severin’ the relationship
 The only doctor I knew to make all of his patients rich
 Snoop, Pac, Em, 50
 Me, Kdot, watch us do a 360
 Plus the Documentary say we from penitentiaries
 I ain’t trippin’, niggas been disloyal for centuries
 Finally got the crown, this mother***er meant for me
 Funny how you do your top 5′ s and don’t mention me
 *** ‘em all

 Father forgive me, cause I ain’t perfect
 No, no no no
 Why is everything wrong?
 Oh I can’t get it right, I always try to get it right

 See I been spendin’ these late nights
 Oo, girls I never seen gettin’
 Constantly intoxicated
 Only God could save me, yeah
 With ‘em by the sunrise
 One day everyone dies
 That’s the way the story goes
 ? I can’t feel my heart
 But I just keep ridin’, ridin’
 Feel so numb, numb, oh yeah

 Father forgive me, cause I ain’t perfect
 No, no no no
 Why is everything wrong?
 Oh I can’t get it right, I always try to get it right
