                        I LIKE IT - Narcotic Thrust

I hate the treadmill everyday
I hate the mundane things they say
the boredom sets in 9 to 5
at night that's when i come alive

I long to be connected
I long to be affected
the bright lights beckon me
beckon me to you

[chorus]
I like it when we go to extremes
I like it when you enter my dreams
I like it when i feel your touch
I like it.. I like it so much
I like it when we're one on one
I like it when we come undone
I like it when we go to extremes
you let me, let me live my dreams

oh oh oh

I like it so much
oh oh oh
I like it so much
oh oh oh
I like it so much

I like it... 

I like it... 

There must be more to life than this
this life i surely will not miss
to spend my time waiting in line
in search for something the grand design

I long to be connected
I long to be affected
the bright lights beckon me
beckon me to you

[chorus]
I like it when we go to extremes
I like it when you enter my dreams
I like it when i feel your touch
I like it.. I like it so much
I like it when we're one on one
I like it when we come undone
I like it when we go to extremes
you let me, let me live my dreams

I like it so much
oh oh oh
I like it so much
oh oh oh
I like it so much
