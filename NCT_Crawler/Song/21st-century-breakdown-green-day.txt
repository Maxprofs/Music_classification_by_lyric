Green Day - 21st Century Breakdown

Born into Nixon I was raised in hell
A welfare child where the teamsters dwelled
The last one born the first one to run
My town was blind from refinery sun

My generation is zero
I never made it as a working class hero

21st century breakdown
I once was lost but never was found
I think I'm losing what's left of my mind
To the 20th century deadline

I was made of poison and blood
Combination is what I understood
Videogames to the tower's fall
Homeland security could kill us all

My generation is zero
I never made it as a working class hero

21st century breakdown
I once was lost but never was found
I think I'm losing what's left of my mind
To the 20th century deadline

We are the cries of the class of '13
Born in the year of humility
We are the desperate in the decline
Raised by the bastards of 1969

My name is 'No one'
The long lost son
Born on the 4th of July
Raised in the barnyards of heroes and cons
That left me for dead or alive

I am a nation
A worker of pride
My debt to the status quo
The scars on my hands
And a means to an end
It's all that I have to show

I swallowed my pride
And I choked on my faith
I've given my heart and my soul
And lied through my teeth
The pillar of damage control

I've been to the edge
And I've thrown the bouquet
Of flowers left over the grave
I sat in the waiting room
Wasting my time
And waiting for judgement day

I praise liberty
The "Freedom to obey"
It's a song that strangles me,
Don't cross the line

Oh, dream, American dream
I can't even sleep
From the light's early dawn

Oh, bleed, America bleed
Believe what you read
From heroes and cons
