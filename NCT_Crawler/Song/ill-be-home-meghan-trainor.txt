                        Bài hát : I'll Be Home - Meghan Trainor

Santa called to make sure I'm prepared
He said winter love is spreading everywhere
Summer came and took off with the spring
So now we star the Christmas caroling

I'll find my way back home
And light up every tree
We will hang our stockings for you and one for me

Cause Santa called to make sure I'm prepared
He said pack your bags and tell them you'll be late

I'll be home with my love
This Christmas
I promise, I promise
I'll be home with my love
This Christmas
I promise, I promise I'll be home
I'll be home
(I'll be home)

Santa called to make sure I'm prepared
He said wrap the gifts with all your love and care
The wind blows the snow up in the sky
But I won't let the wind delay my flight

I'll be home with my love
This Christmas
I promise, I promise
I'll be home with my love
This Christmas
I promise, I promise I'll be home

I'll be home, I'll be home
I promise, I promise I'll be home
I'll be home, I'll be home
(I'll be home)

Santa called to make sure I'm prepared
He said pack your bags and tell them you'll be there

I'll be home with my love
This Christmas
I promise, I promise
I'll be home with my love
This Christmas
I promise, I promise I'll be home
I'll be home, I'll be home

I'll be home with my love
This Christmas
I promise, I promise
I'll be home
