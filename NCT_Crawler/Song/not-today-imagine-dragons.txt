                        Bài hát: Not Today (From "Me Before You" Soundtrack) - Imagine Dragons

There she goes
In front of me
Take my life
Set me free again
We'll make a memory out of it

Holy Rollers at my back
Don't look on, take me back again
We'll make a memory out of it

(pre-chorus)
We finally fall apart and we break each other hearts
If we wanna live young love
We better start today

(chorus)
Its gotta get a easier, oh easier somehow
Cause I'm falling, I'm falling
Oh easier, and easier somehow
Oh, I'm calling, I'm calling 
And it isn't over
Unless it is over
I don't wanna wait for that
Its gotta get easier, and easier somehow
But not today......Not today

There she goes
In front of me
Take my life, set me free again
We'll make a memory out of it

Holy Rollers, at my back
Don't look on, take me back again
We'll make a memory out of it

(pre-chorus)
We finally fall apart and we break each other hearts
If we wanna live young love
We better start today

(chorus)
Its gotta get a easier, oh easier somehow
Cause I'm falling, I'm falling
Oh easier, and easier somehow
Oh, I'm calling, I'm calling
And it isn't over
Unless it is over, 
I don't wanna wait for that
Its gotta get easier, and easier so.....

(Bridge)
Come with me
Come with me
Aye-eeeeh
So come with me
Oh come with me aye-ehhhh

Not today, not today, not today, not today

(chorus)
Its gotta get a easier, and easier somehow
Cause I'm falling, I'm falling, Oh easier, and easier somehow
Oh, I'm calling, I'm calling and it isn't over
Unless it is over, I don't wanna wait for that
Its gotta get easier, and easier somehow

(finale)
Its gotta get easier, and easier somehow
But not today, not today, not today, not today, not today....
