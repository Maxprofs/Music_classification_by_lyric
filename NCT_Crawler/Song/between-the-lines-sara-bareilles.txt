                        Time to tell me the truth
 To burden your mouth for what you say
 No pieces of paper in the way 'Cause I can't continue pretending to choose
 These opposite sides on which we fall
 The loving you later as if at all
 No right minds could wrong me this many times My memory is cruel
 Queen of attention to details
 Defending intentions if he fails Until now, he told me her name
 It sounded familiar in a way
 I could have sworn I'd heard him say it
 Ten thousand times, oh, if only I had been listening Leave unsaid, unspoken
 Eyes wide shut, unopened
 You and me always between the lines
 Between the lines I thought I, thought I was ready to bleed
 That we'd move from the shadows on the wall
 Stand in the center of it all Too late, two choices, to stay or to leave
 Mine was so easy to uncover
 He'd already left with the other
 So I learned to listen through silence Leave unsaid, unspoken
 Eyes wide shut, unopened
 You and me always be
 You and me always be I tell myself all the words he surely meant to say
 I'll talk until the conversation doesn't stay on
 Wait for me, I'm almost ready when he meant let go Leave unsaid, unspoken
 Eyes wide shut, unopened
 You and me always be
 You and me always between the lines
 Between the lines, between the lines
                        
                    |
