                        It's up in my heart
 When it skips a beat
 Can't feel no pavement
 Right under my feet Up in my lonely room
 When I'm dreamin' of you
 Oh, what can I do ? I still need you
 But I don't want you now When I'm down and my hands are tied
 I cannot reach a pen for me to draw the line
 From this pain I just can't disguise
 Its gonna hurt but I'll have to say goodbye Up in my lonely room
 When I'm dreamin' of you
 Oh, what can I do? I still need you
 But I don't want you now Up in my lonely room
 When I'm dreamin' of you
 Oh what can I do
 I still need you
 But I don't want you now
                        
                    |
