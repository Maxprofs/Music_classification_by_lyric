                        (michael sembello) In the news today
 Heavy weather
 Oh, I can remember
 The skies were so blue
 That lucky old moon I promised to you
 Now it's gone lately
 Something's happening
 I don't understand Oh, how come decembers
 Are hotter that june?
 And how come the flowers
 Don't know when to bloom?
 Something's wrong, people
 Something's happening
 Happening where we live The rising smoke against an endless sea of cars
 As mother nature gets another senseless scar In the news today
 I guess we're in for heavy weather
 In the world today
 We're heading for some heavy weather The rain is falling harder each day
 The faces keep changing
 But the problem remains
 Something's wrong, people
 Right before our eyes
 We've been hypnotized The sound of silence
 Broken by the sound of war
 How can we heal
 If we keep opening up the sore? In the news today
 I guess we're in for heavy weather
 In the world today
 We're heading for some heavy weather Will we ever hear the message?
 Read the signs?
 Stop all this talking now
 It's time to save our lives In the news today
 I guess we're in for heavy weather
 In the world today
 We're heading for some heavy... The road ahead keeps leading back again
 The train we're on is coming to an end
 Let's open up our eyes In the world today
 We're heading for some heavy weather In the news today
 I guess we're in for heavy weather In the news today
 I guess we're in for heavy weather
