                        [Verse 1]
 All I am is a man
 I want the world in my hands
 I hate the beach
 But I stand in California with my toes in the sand
 Use the sleeves off my sweater
 Lets have an adventure
 Heads in the clouds but my gravity's centered
 Touch my neck and I'll touch yours
 You in those little high waisted shorts
 Oh

 [Pre-Chorus]
 She knows what I think about
 And what I think about
 One love, two mouths
 One love, one house
 No shirts, no blouse
 Just us to find out
 Nothing that I really wanna tell you about no

 [Chorus]
 Cause it's too cold whoa
 For you here
 And now
 So let me hold whoa
 Both your hands in the holes of my sweater

 [Verse 2]
 And if I may just take your breath away
 I don't mind if there's not much to say
 Sometimes the silence guides our minds
 To move to a place so far away
 The goosebumps start raise
 The minute that my left hand meets your waist
 And then I watched your face
 Put my finger on your tongue
 Cause you love the taste yeah
 These hearts adore
 Everyone the other beats hardest for 
 Inside this place is warm
 Outside it starts to pour

 [Pre-Chorus]
 Coming down
 One love, two mouths
 One love, one house
 No shirt, no blouse
 Just us, you find out
 Nothing that I really wanna tell you about
 No no no

 [Chorus]
 Cause it's too cold whoa
 For you here
 And now
 So let me hold whoa
 Both your hands in the holes of my sweater

 Cause it's too cold whoa
 For you here
 And now
 So let me hold whoa
 Both your hands in the holes of my sweater
 Hold

 [Bridge]
 Whoa, whoa...
 Whoa, whoa... whoa
 Whoa, whoa... (x2)

 [Chorus]
 Cause it's too cold whoa
 For you here
 And now
 So let me hold whoa
 Both your hands in the holes of my sweater

 It's too cold whoa
 For you here
 And now
 So let me hold whoa
 Both your hands in the holes of my sweater

 And it's too cold, it's too cold
 The holes of my sweater...
