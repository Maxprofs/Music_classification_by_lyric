                        Stand, stand and walk
 Tragedy is cheap and so is talk
 The decision yours to make, what will you do?
 In the end it comes back to you
 'Cause it's a long way to fall Thunder, don't scare me at all
 Lightning, well just a little
 Pressure, it ain't worth a dime
 And your wounds, they'll all heal in time
 'Cause it's a long way to fall The answers are getting harder
 The answers are getting harder
 The answers are getting harder The answers are getting harder
 (If an answer comes to those who pray)
 (Comes to those who pray)
 The answers are getting harder
 (If an answer comes to those who pray)
 (Comes to those who pray) The answers are getting harder and harder
 (If an answer comes to those who pray)
 (Comes to those who pray)
 And there ain't no way to bargain or to barter
 But if you've got the angst you got the ardor
 You might faint from the fight but you're gonna find it For every challenge could have paradise behind it
 And if you accept what you have lost and you stand tall
 You might just get it back and you can get it all
 So now you know why it's a long way to fall
 Yeah 'cause it's a long way to fall, it's a long way to fall So stand, stand and walk
 Stand
