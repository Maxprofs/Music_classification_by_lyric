Trình Bày: Sade
Album:lovers Rock

you think i'd leave your side baby?
you know me better than that
you think i'd leave down 
when your down on your knees?
i wouldn't do that
i'll do you right when your wrong
i-----ohhh, ohhh
if only you could see into me
oh, when your cold
i'll be there to hold you tight to me
when your on the outside baby 
and you can't get in
i will show you,
 your so much better than you know
when your lost, when your alone 
and you can't get back again
i will find you darling i'll bring you home
if you want to cry
i am here to dry your eyes
and in no time you'll be fine
you think i'd leave your side baby
you know me better than that
you think i'd leave you down 
when your down on your knees
i wouldn't do that
i'll do you right when your wrong
i-----i, ohhhh, ohhh
if only you could see into me
oh when your cold
i'll be there
to hold you tight to me
oh when your alone
i'll be there by your side baby
oh when your cold
i'll be there
to hold you tight to me
oh when your alone
i'll be there by your side baby
