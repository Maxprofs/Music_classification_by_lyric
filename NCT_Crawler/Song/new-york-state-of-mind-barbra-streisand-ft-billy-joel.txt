                        Bài hát : New York State Of Mind - Barbra Streisand, Billy Joel

Some folks like to get away 
Take a holiday from the neighborhood 
Hop a flight to Miami Beach or to Hollywood 
But I'm takin' a Greyhound 
On the Hudson River line 
I'm in a New York state of mind 
Seen all those movie stars 
And their fancy cars and their limousines 
Been high in the Rockies, under the evergreens 
But I know what I'm needin' 
And I don't wanna waste more time 
I'm in a New York state of mind 
It was so easy livin' day by day 
Out of touch with the rhythm and blues 
But now I need a little give and take 
The New York Times and the Daily News 
Comes down to reality 
And it's fine with me cause I've let it slide 
I don't care if it's Chinatown or up on Riverside 
I don't have any reasons 
I've left them all behind 
I'm in a New York state of mind 
It was so easy livin' day by day 
Out of touch with the rhythm and blues 
But now I need a little give and take 
The New York Times and the Daily News 
Comes down to reality 
And it's fine with me cause I've let it slide 
I don't care if it's Chinatown or up on Riverside 
We don't have any reasons 
Cause left them all behind 
I'm in a New York, I'm in a New York state of mind...
