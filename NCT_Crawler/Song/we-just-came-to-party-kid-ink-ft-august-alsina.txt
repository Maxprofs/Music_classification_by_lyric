(Pre-Hook)
Let’s skip the conversation
Got no patience
Lookin for a good girl
It’s a special occasion
Bitches be like

(Hook)
We just came to party, man we just came to party
We we we just came to party, we we just came to party
Niggas be like we just came to party, we just came to party
We we we just came to party, we we just came to party

(Verse)
Okay now we just came to party, started kinda late
Probably one into the morning, just live out the time
It’s bout to ride down the highway, would hit a club
Find a hottie off of molly, fall in love
Man them niggas be like
(We be poppin bottles)
But you still be in the line
I ain’t even on the list, you can see me on flyer
Reason why I got yo girl on my fly, I swear to God
She be singing in the club like Mariah
Man them bitches be like
We can hit the studio, never seen a booth before
I can book a session, man I promise you’ll get every note
She be like (what a dream)
I be like (errthang)
Running out of time for the game so

(Pre-Hook)
Let’s skip the conversation
Got no patience
Lookin for a good girl
It’s a special occasion
Bitches be like

(Hook)
We just came to party, man we just came to party
We we we just came to party, we we just came to party
Niggas be like we just came to party, we just came to party
We we we just came to party, we we just came to party

(Verse)
What you stop and flow
Drinks lined up like dominoes
Sayin once you seen enough flow
Round two, go and take it down boo
Don’t be afraid though you is bout that life
Man them bitches be like
She might see me later on
Baby andale, yeah, *** we waitin for now?
You know where the door is, say you got class
We can take it where yo dorm is, over or a cab baby
Don’t think that she drive, getting harder to disguise
If we runnin out of time, I think you should decide
If you comin for the ride
Try to make it home before the sun is on the rise
Get the vibe, we go

(Bridge)
Wutchu wanna do?
I could follow through with my crew
Niggas be like
Hurry up, just hurry up
On your way get drinks, I got the drugs
Bitches be like
Roll up, fill this cup up
Watch me cut up
Wussup?
I already know, man and them niggas be like
Slow up, let me pour up, do you roll up?
Turn up, I throw this dough up and them bitches be like

(Hook)

We we we just came to party, we we just came to party
