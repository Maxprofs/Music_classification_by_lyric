I said that I’ma ride for my mother***ing niggas,
Most likely I’ma die with my finger on the trigger
I've been grinding outside, all day with my niggas
And I ain’t going in, unless I'm with my nigga
My nigga, my nigga
My nigga, my nigga (My mother***ing niggas!)
My nigga, my nigga (My nigga, my nigga)
My nigga, my nigga

First thing first, I love all of my niggas
This rap *** crack, then I involve my niggas
You looking for some lean, let me call my nigga
He sell it for the high, I need all my niggas
Some nigga smoke, smoke, some nigga drink, drink
Got niggas on the block with the glock they don't think
That’s a nigga back up, they in the bucket lapped up
I got that act right if you niggas wanna act up
He talking like a snitch, no that ain’t my nigga
He tripping off a bitch, no, that ain’t my nigga
Take a nigga case, ***, that’s my nigga
Know him since I was 8, yeah, that’s my nigga
*** my first bitch passed her to my nigga
Hit my first lick pass with my nigga
*** them other niggas ‘cause I’m down for my niggas
I ride for my niggas, *** them other niggas

I said that I’ma ride for my mother***ing niggas,
Most likely I’ma die with my finger on the trigger
I've been grinding outside, all day with my niggas
And I ain’t going in, unless I'm with my nigga
My nigga, my nigga (dope boys, my niggas)
My nigga, my nigga (YG, my nigga)
My nigga, my nigga (Rich Homie, my nigga)
My nigga, my nigga (It's the mother***ing world)

You know I'm down with the niggas down for me
I got two words for you, love and loyalty
It’s me and my nigga tripping on a half of bean
We used to hit up wall and buy everything we see
Me and my down ass nigga getting twisted
Nigga get to tripping knock the gravy, out your biscuit
Jay know I *** with you the long way, my nigga
So when I see you out I’m like hey, my nigga
Tried to act right, buy the case my niggas
Drink the act right and get straight with my niggas
Me and my nigga riding dirty, tryna chase them figures
Who got the yola? who got the yola? Don’t matter, go figure

I said that I’ma ride for my mother***ing niggas,
Most likely I’ma die with my finger on the trigger
I've been grinding outside, all day with my niggas
And I ain’t going in, unless I'm with my nigga
My nigga, my nigga
My nigga, my nigga (YG, my nigga)
My nigga, my nigga (Rich Homie, my nigga)
My nigga, my nigga (My nigga, my nigga)

My nigga sell cake, my nigga got weight
My nigga fronted me, he the reason I'm straight
My nigga got a house, my nigga got a lake
My nigga we eating, my nigga get a plate
And I'm still hittin' licks, my nigga, my nigga
Knock a nigga ***, my nigga, my nigga
I *** a nigga bitch with my nigga, my nigga
If a nigga talking *** then he ain’t my nigga
My nigga, my nigga
YG my nigga and I ain’t going in they
Tryna leave my nigga, shawty see me and wanna leave with a nigga
But it wasn't enough room ‘cause I came with my niggas
My niggas, my niggas, I need to settle in ‘cause I’m too fly, nigga
And I’m all about my business like a suit and tie, nigga
I'll ride for my niggas believe that

I said that I’ma ride for my mother***ing niggas,
Most likely I’ma die with my finger on the trigger
I been grinding outside, all day with my niggas
And I ain’t going in, unless I'm with my nigga
My nigga, my nigga
My nigga, my nigga (My mother***ing niggas)
My nigga, my nigga (My nigga, my nigga)
My nigga, my nigga (My mother***ing niggas)
My nigga, my nigga (My mother***ing niggas)
My nigga, my nigga
My nigga, my nigga
My nigga, my nigga (My mother***ing niggas)
My nigga, my nigga (My mother***ing niggas)
