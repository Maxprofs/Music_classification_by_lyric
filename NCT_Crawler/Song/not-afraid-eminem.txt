                        [Chorus] 
I’m not afraid to take a stand 
Everybody come take my hand 
We’ll walk this road together, through the storm 
Whatever weather, cold or warm 
Just let you know that, you’re not alone 
Holla if you feel like you’ve been down the same road 

[Intro] 
Yeah, It’s been a ride... 
I guess I had to go to that place to get to this one 
Now some of you might still be in that place 
If you’re trying to get out, just follow me 
I’ll get you there 

[Verse 1] 
You can try and read my lyrics off of this paper before I lay ‘em 
But you won’t take the sting out these words before I say ‘em 
Cause ain’t no way I’m let you stop me from causing mayhem 
When I say ‘em or do something I do it, I don’t give a damn 
What you think, I’m doing this for me, so *** the world 
Feed it beans, it’s gassed up, if it thinks its stopping me 
I’mma be what I set out to be, without a doubt undoubtedly 
And all those who look down on me I’m tearing down your balcony 
No if ands or buts don’t try to ask him why or how can he 
From Infinite down to the last Relapse album he’s still ***tin’ and 
Whether he’s on salary, paid hourly 
Until he bows out or he ***’s his bowels out of him 
Whichever comes first, for better or worse 
He’s married to the game, like a *** you for Christmas 
His gift is a curse, forget the earth he’s got the urge 
To pull his duck from the dirt and *** the whole Universe 

[Chorus] 

[Verse 2] 
Ok quit playin’ with the scissors and ***, and cut the *** 
I shouldn’t have to rhyme these words in the rhythm for you to know it’s a rap 
You said you was king, you lied through your teeth 
For that *** your feelings, instead of getting crowned you’re getting capped 
And to the fans, I’ll never let you down again, I’m back 
I promise to never go back on that promise, in fact 
Let’s be honest, that last Relapse CD was “ehhhh” 
Perhaps I ran them accents into the ground 
Relax, I ain’t going back to that now 
All I’m tryna say is get back click-clack BLAOW ! 
Cause I ain’t playin’ around 
There’s a game called circle and I don’t know how 
I’m way too up to back down 
But I think I’m still tryna figure this *** out 
Thought I had it mapped out but I guess I didn’t 
This ***ing black cloud’s still follow’s me around 
But it’s time to exercise these demons 
These mother***ers are doing jumping jacks now! 

[Chorus] 

[Bridge] 
And I just can’t keep living this way 
So starting today, I’m breaking out of this cage 
I’m standing up, Imma face my demons 
I’m manning up, Imma hold my ground 
I’ve had enough, now I’m so fed up 
Time to put my life back together right now 

[Verse 3] 
It was my decision to get clean, I did it for me 
Admittedly I probably did it subliminally for you 
So I could come back a brand new me, you helped see me through 
And don’t even realise what you did, believe me you 
I been through the ringer, but they can do little to the middle finger 
I think I got a tear in my eye, I feel like the king of 
My World, haters can make like bees with no stingers, and drop dead 
No more beef flingers, no more drama from now on, I promise 
To focus solely on handling my responsibility’s as a father 
So I solemnly swear to always treat this roof like my daughters and raise it 
You couldn’t lift a single shingle on it 
Cause the way I feel, I’m strong enough to go to the club 
Or the corner pub and lift the whole liquor counter up 
Cause I’m raising the bar, I shoot for the moon 
But I’m too busy gazing at stars, I feel amazing and 

[Chorus] 
I’m not afraid to take a stand 
Everybody come take my hand 
We’ll walk this road together, through the storm 
Whatever weather, cold or warm 
Just let you know that, you’re not alone 
Holla if you feel like you’ve been down the same road.
