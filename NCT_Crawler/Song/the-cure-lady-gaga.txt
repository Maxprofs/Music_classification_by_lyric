                        Bài hát: The Cure - Lady Gaga

I'll undress you, cause you're God
Cover you as you decide
When you fall asleep inside my arms
May not have the fancy things
But I'll give you everything
You could ever want, it's in my arms
So baby tell me yes, and I will give you everything
So baby tell me yes, and I will be all yours tonight
So baby tell me yes, and I will give you everything
I will be right by your side
If I can find a cure, I would fix you with my love
No matter what you know, I'll fix you with my love
And when you say you're okay, I'm gonna heal you anyway
Promise I'll always be there, promise I'll be the cure
Be the cure
Love your feet, your hands, your legs
Let me take care of ya' babe
Close your eyes, I'll sing your favorite song
I wrote you this lullaby
Hush now baby, don't you cry
Anything you want could not be wrong
So baby tell me yes, and I will give you everything
So baby tell me yes, and I will be all yours tonight
So baby tell me yes, and I will give you everything
I will be right by your side
If I can find a cure, I would fix you with my love
No matter what you know, I'll fix you with my love
And when you say you're okay, I'm gonna heal you anyway
Promise I'll always be there, promise I'll be the cure
Be the cure
I'll fix you with my love
I'll fix you with my love
(I'll fix you with my love)
If I can find a cure, I would fix you with my love
No matter what you know, I'll fix you with my love
And when you say you're okay, I'm gonna heal you anyway
Promise I'll always be there, promise I'll be the cure
Be the cure
Be the cure
Be the cure
I'll fix you with my love
