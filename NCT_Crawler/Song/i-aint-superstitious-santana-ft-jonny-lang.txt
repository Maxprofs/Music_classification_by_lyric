                        Well, I ain't superstitious
 But a black cat 'crossed my trail
 No, I ain't superstitious
 But a black cat 'crossed my trail Bad luck ain't got me too far
 I won't let it stop me now, no, no Well, the dogs began to bark
 All over my neighborhood
 Ooh, the dogs began to bark
 All over my neighborhood It's a mean old world to live in
 I can't face it by myself at all Oh, yeah
 Oh, yes I will Well, the dogs began to bark
 All over my neighborhood, yeah, yes
 Well, the dogs began to bark
 All over my neighborhood I got a feeling 'bout the future
 And I know it ain't too good Well, I ain't superstitious
 But a black cat 'crossed my trail
 I know I ain't superstitious
 But a black cat 'crossed my trail Bad luck ain't got me too far
 Ain't gonna let it stop me now, oh, no, no, no, no And I know it ain't good, yeah
 This can't be good, no, no
 Oh, no, sinner you said it here, ooh yeah
 Alright, alright, alright
