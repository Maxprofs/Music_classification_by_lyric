                        Snow is falling
all around me
children playing
having fun

it's the season
love and understanding
merry christmas everyone

time for parties and celebration
people dancing all night long
time for presents
and exchanging kisses
time for singing christmas songs

we're gonna have a party tonight
i'm gonna find that girl underneath the misteltoe,
we'll kissed by candlelight

Room is swaying, records playing
All the songs, we love to hear
All I wish that everyday was christmas
What a nice way to spend the year

We're gonna have a party tonight
I'm gonna find that girl
Underneath the mistletoe, we'll kiss by candle light

Snow is fallin, all around me
Children playing, having fun
It's the season, love and understanding
Merry christmas everyone
Merry christmas everyone

Oah merry cristmas everyone

Snow is falling, all around me
Children playing, having fun
It's the season, love and understanding
Merry christmas everyone

Snow is falling, all around me
Children playing, having fun
It's the season, love and understanding
Merry christmas everyone

Snow is falling, all around me
Children playing, having fun
It's the season, love and understanding
Merry christmas everyone
Merry christmas everyone
Merry christmas everyone
