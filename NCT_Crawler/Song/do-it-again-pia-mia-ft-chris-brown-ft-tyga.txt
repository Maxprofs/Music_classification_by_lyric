                        Bài hát: Do It Again - Pia Mia, Chris Brown, Tyga

[Tyga:]
Bye baby, they ain't fly baby
Looking at the whip frame, that's a nice 'Cedez
Used to throw it to me, that's Tom Brady
With the long blonde hair, that's Marcia Brady
I'm all about your Lately Chelsea Handler, handler
Got your legs racing hard on vacation
No exaggeration, said you amazing
Moving too fast, can't pace it

[Pia Mia (Tyga):]
Hey boy, when I first met you
Thought it was special
I told you that
Hey boy, I bet true love was pourin'
When I kissed you I meant it
I wanna go back, (I don't wanna go)
I wanna go back, (But if you wanna go)
Can we go back, (I'll make it happen though)
Boy can we go back, (Let's do it soon)

[Chorus - Pia Mia x2:]
It's nice to, nice to know ya, let's do it again
How we did it in a one night stand
Boy I wanna be more than a friend to ya
It's nice to, nice to know ya, let's do it again
How we did it in a one night stand
Boy I wanna be more than a friend to ya
Let's do it again

[Chris Brown:]
Hey baby, are you sure that you want it
Or caught up in the moment?
Oh baby, it got a little crazy on the first night
So I'ma have to do you better than the first time
I'm lovin' how you scratchin' and you grittin' your teeth
I'm lovin' how that booty shake when it's on me
You gotta nigga blowing up your caller ID
Guess it was a set up, you got me

[Chorus - Pia Mia & Chris Brown]

[Pia Mia:]
I wanna go back, (one more time)
Wanna go back, (let's do it again)
Can we go back, (can you take me baby)
Boy can we go back
[x2]

[Chorus - Pia Mia]

[Tyga:]
Pia let me know
                        
                    |
