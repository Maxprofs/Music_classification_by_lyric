Ooh, I can't wait to get next to you
Ohh, I just can't leave you alone
Boy you got me doin' things that I would never do
And I can't stop the way I'm feelin' if I wanted to
I'm crazy 'bout the way that you could make me say your name
And if I couldn't have you, I would probably go insane, 'cause

Only you can me feel
(Only you can make me feel)
And only you can take me there
(Only you can take me there)

Only you can me feel
(Only you, only you can make me feel)
And only you can take me there
(Only you can take me there)

Ooh, I can't wait to get next to you
Ohh, I just can't leave you alone
Boy you stay inside my mind, ain't no denyin' that
And only you could do them things that got me comin' back
This gotta be the realest thing that I have ever felt
And I'll do what I gotta do to keep you to myself, 'cause

Only you can me feel
(Only you can make me feel)
And only you can take me there
(Only you can take me there)

Only you can me feel
(Only you can make me feel)
And only you can take me there
(Only you can take me there)

Crazy
(Crazy)
'Bout the
('Bout the)
Way you
(Make me)
Feel

I just
(I just)
Gotta
(Gotta)
Have you
(Have you)
Here

And I
(And I)
Wanna
(Wanna)
Let you
(Let you)
Know

I won't
(I won't)
Ever
(Ever)
Let you
(Let you)
Go

Only you can me feel
(Only you can make me feel)
And only you can take me there
(Only you can take me there)

Only you can make me feel
(You can make me feel)
And only you can take me there
(Only you can take me there)

Ooh, I can't wait to get next to you
Ohh, I just can't leave you alone
