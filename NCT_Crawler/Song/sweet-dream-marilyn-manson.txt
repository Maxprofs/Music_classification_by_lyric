                        Sweet dreams are made of this 
Who am I to disagree? 
Travel the world and the seven seas 
Everybody's looking for something 
Some of them want to use you 
Some of them want to get used by you 
Some of them want to abuse you 
Some of them want to be abused 

Sweet dreams are made of this 
Who am I to disagree? 
Travel the world and the seven seas 
Everybody's looking for something 

Some of them want to use you 
Some of them want to get used by you 
Some of them want to abuse you 
Some of them want to be abused! 

I wanna use you and abuse you 
I wanna know what's inside you 

Movin' on 
Hold your head up 
Movin' on 
Keep your head up (repeats 3x) 

Movin' on! 

Sweet dreams are made of this 
Who am I to disagree? 
Travel the world and the seven seas

I'm gonna use you and abuse you 
I'm gonna know what's inside 
Gonna use you and abuse you 
I'm gonna know what's inside you
