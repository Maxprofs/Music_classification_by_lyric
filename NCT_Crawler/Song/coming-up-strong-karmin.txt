                        Song: Coming Up Strong - Karmin

 Why you crying? It's ok now
 If I hold you, will you calm down?
 It's your way with words, that can make me burn
 When you say it, do you mean it?
 When I shout out, can you hear me?
 When it's all too much, look at what we've done
 That's when I'm comin' up strong, comin' up strong
 comin' up, comin' up strong, comin' up ohh
 now, now, nothin' you can do to break us now
 singin' our song gettin' lost to the sound
 once i was lost, now I'm found
 shinin' through the dark can't hold us down
 That's when I'm comin' up strong, comin' up strong
 comin' up, comin' up strong, comin' up ohh
 now, now, nothin' you can do to break us now
 singin' our song gettin' lost to the sound
 once i was lost, now I'm found
 shinin' through the dark can't hold us down
 Call me ruthless, we've been through this
 Who's to blame now, babe it's useless
 Cause it's no one's fault, if the lights were off
 When we're shinin', then we're flyin'
 Through the wheelhouse, that we're grindin'
 When it's all too much, look at what we've done
 That's when I'm comin' up strong, comin' up strong
 comin' up, comin' up strong, comin' up ohh
 now, now, nothin' you can do to break us now
 singin' our song gettin' lost to the sound
 once i was lost, now I'm found
 shinin' through the dark can't hold us down
 That's when I'm comin' up strong, comin' up strong
 comin' up, comin' up strong, comin' up ohh
 now, now, nothin' you can do to break us now
 singin' our song gettin' lost to the sound
 once i was lost, now I'm found
 shinin' through the dark can't hold us down
 So easy
 We forget and say clouds are movin' in
 Rain starts to fall again
 But as soon as you tell me it's okay
 That's when I'm comin' up strong, comin' up strong
 comin' up, comin' up strong, comin' up ohh
 now, now, nothin' you can do to break us now
 singin' our song gettin' lost to the sound
 once i was lost, now I'm found
 shinin' through the dark can't hold us down
 That's when I'm comin' up strong, comin' up strong
 comin' up, comin' up strong, comin' up ohh
 now, now, nothin' you can do to break us now
 singin' our song gettin' lost to the sound
 once i was lost, now I'm found
 shinin' through the dark can't hold us down
 Why you crying? It's ok now
 If I hold you, will you calm down?
 When it's all too much, look at what we've done
