                        [Rihanna]
I know you've been hurt, by, someone else.
I can tell by the way, you carry yourself.
If you let me, here's what I'll do.
I'll take care of you.
I've loved and I've lost.

[Drake] [Verse1]
I've asked about you, and they told me things,
But, my mind didn't change and I still feel the same
What's a life with no fun, please don't be so ashamed.
I've had mine, you've had yours.
We both know, we know.
They won't get you like I will,
My only wish is I die real,
Cause that truth hurts and those lies heal.
And you can't sleep thinking that he lies still.
So you cry still, tears all in her pillowcase,
Big girls all get a little taste, oh
Pushing me away, so I give her space oh.
Dealing with a heart that I didn't break.
I'll be there for you, I will care for you
I keep thinking you just don't know.
Tryna run from that, say you done with that,
On your face girl it just don't show.
When your ready, just say your ready.
When all the baggage just ain't as heavy,
And the party's over just don't forget me.
We'll change the pace, and we'll just go slow.

[Hook] [Drake]
You won't ever have to worry.
You won't ever have to hide.
And you have seen all my mistakes,
So look me in my eyes.

[Rihanna]
Cause if you let me, here's what I'll do.
I'll take care of you.
I've loved and I've lost.

[Verse 2] [Drake]
It's my birthday, I'll get high if I want to,
Can't deny that I want you,
But I'll lie if I have to. Cause you don't say you love me,
To your friends when they ask you.
Even though we both know that you do, you do.
One time, been in love one time.
You and all your girls in the club one time.
All so convinced that you're following your heart,
Cause your mind don't control what it does sometimes.
We all have our nights though,
                        
                    |
