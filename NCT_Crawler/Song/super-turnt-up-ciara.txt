We been keepin' secrets from each other
I just wanna say what's on my mind
Boy you make me feel like a woman
I’mma need this feeling all the time

[Pre-Hook]
Word around town is Shawty got that good look
Once you get a dose of it, have you locked down
I call him Mr. Batman, hit 'em on his cellular
Signal in the sky, yea there he go

That's my baby
He be puttin' it down
I love my baby
We go round and round

[Hook 2x]
You know that I

Boy your love got me super turnt up
I can’t lie, I’m super turnt up
Super turnt up, super turnt up

You go out of your way to make me happy
You deserve the man of the year(the year)
I need to put that in my life
Keep you by my side
Ain’t no way around it, let’s be clear

[Pre-Hook]

Put that boomerang on you baby keep it coming back

Screw it up, slow it down like this
Top notch, I be so high
Them other broads can’t even see me

Running through yo hood, speakers loud with the top drop
We ain’t never been turnt to a love fiend
