                        You just wanna fill the void now
 I can tell that you’ve been yelling at him all night long
 And I can hear it in your voice now
 He got you smoking extra packs a day
 Don’t you worry bout me talking
 I know why you’ve been coming
 I’ll be quiet this say nothing to me
 Just wrap your legs around my waist
 I won’t stop until you ask me
 Don’t you worry bout us messing up my sheets
 Cause unlike you I got nothing to hide
                        
                    |
