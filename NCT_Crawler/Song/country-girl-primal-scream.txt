                        You never get too big
 You never get too heavy
 You never get too cool you stop paying your dues
 Yeah, What can a poor boy do
 Better go back to yr mama
 She'll take care of you

 Lost your wife
 Lost your son
 Stay out drinking till the morning comes
 Yeah
 What can a poor boy do
 Better go back to your mama
 She'll take care of you

 Country girl
 Take my hand
 Lead me thru this diseased land
 I am tired I am weiry I am worn
 I have stole
 I have sinned
 Oh my soul
 Its unclean
 Country girl
 Gotta keep on keeping on

 Crazy women
 Mess your head up
 Wake up drunk and beaten
 In some strange bed
 Yeah
 What can a poor boy do
 Better go back to your mama
 Shell take care of you

 One more time

 Country girl
 Take my hand
 Lead me thru this diseased land
 I am tired I am weiry I am worn
 I have stole
 I have sinned
 Oh my soul
 Its unclean
 Country girl

 Gotta keep on keeping on
 Gotta keep on keeping on
 Gotta keep on keeping strong
 Gotta keep on keeping on
 With you
 Got the riot city blues

 What do you have to say
 Before I have to go
 Be careful what you say
 Youll reap just what you sow
 Yeah
 What can a poor boy do
 What can I do
 Better go back to yr mama
 Shell take care of you

 One last time

 Country girl
 Take my hand
 Lead me thru this diseased land
 I am tired I am weiry I am worn
 I have stole
 I have sinned
 Oh my soul
 Its unclean
 Country girl
 Gotta keep on keeping on

 Country girl
 Gotta keep on keeping on
