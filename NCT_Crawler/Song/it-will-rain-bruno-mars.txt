If you ever leave me, baby, 
Leave some morphine at my door 
Cause it would take a whole lot of medication 
To realize what we used to have, 
We don't have it anymore. 

There's no religion that could save me 
No matter how long my knees are on the floor, oh 
So keep in mind all the sacrifices i'm making 
To keep you by my side 
And keep you from walking out the door. 

Cause there'll be no sunlight 
If I lose you, baby 
There'll be no clear skies 
If I lose you, baby 
Just like the clouds pass, 
I will do the same 
if you walk away 
Everyday, it will rain, 
Rain, rain. 

2. 
I'll never be your mother's favorite 
Your daddy can't even look me in the eye 
Oooh if I was in their shoes,Ii'd be doing the same thing 
Saying there goes my little girl 
Walking with that troublesome guy. 

But they're just afraid of something they can't understand 
Oooh well little darling watch me change their minds 
Yeah for you I'll try, I'll try, I'll try, I'll try 
I'll pick up these broken pieces 'til I'm bleeding 
If that'll make it right. 

Ooooh don't just say 
Goodbye, don't just say, goodbye 
I'll pick up these broken pieces 'til I'm bleeding 
If that'll make it right. 

Cause there'll be no sunlight 
If I lose you, baby 
There'll be no clear skies 
If I lose you, baby 
Just like the clouds pass, 
I will do the same 
if you walk away 
Everyday, it will rain, 
Rain, rain.
