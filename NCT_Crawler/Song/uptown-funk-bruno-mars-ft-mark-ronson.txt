                        Bài hát : Uptown Funk - Bruno Mars, Mark Ronson

This hit 
That ice cold 
Michelle Pfeiffer
That white gold
This one, for them hood girls
Them good girls
Straight masterpieces 
Stylin', while in
Livin’ it up in the city
Got Chucks on with Saint Laurent
Got kiss myself I’m so pretty

(1)
 I’m too hot (hot damn)
Called a police and a fireman
I’m too hot (hot damn)
Make a dragon wanna retire man
I’m too hot (hot damn)
Say my name you know who I am
I’m too hot (hot damn)
Am I bad 'bout that money
Break it down

Girls hit your hallelujah (whuoo)
Girls hit your hallelujah (whuoo)
Girls hit your hallelujah (whuoo)
‘Cause Uptown Funk gon’ give it to you
‘Cause Uptown Funk gon’ give it to you
‘Cause Uptown Funk gon’ give it to you
Saturday night and we in the spot
Don’t believe me just watch (come on)
Don’t believe me just watch
Don’t believe me just watch
Don’t believe me just watch
Don’t believe me just watch
Don’t believe me just watch
Hey, hey, hey, oh!
Stop
Wait a minute
Fill my cup, put some liquor in it
Take a sip, sign a check
Julio, get the stretch
Ride to Harlem, Hollywood, Jackson, Mississippi
If we show up, we gon' show out
Smoother than a fresh dry skippy

(2)
I’m too hot (hot damn)
