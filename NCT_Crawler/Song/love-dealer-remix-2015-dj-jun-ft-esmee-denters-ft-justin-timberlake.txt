                        Bài hát: Love Dealer (Remix 2015) - DJ Jun, Esmee Denters, Justin Timberlake

Let's go
Baby, I gotta have some more
Turn the track up
What's it gonna take to get a score?
Turn the beat up, yeah

Got me like a fiend banging on your door
I think I want some of that
Why don't you meet me on the floor?
And then

Step into my office
Won't you try to sample, a taste of my stuff?
I've got a million different flavors
All the boys say they can't get enough

Once I'm under your skin, you're begging me for more
You'll get addicted to this but baby, you've been wrong
Don't let these innocent eyes fool you
When I'm on the floor, the floor, the floor

'Cause I could be your dealer
I can be your only friend when you need a
I'll keep you coming back again

You can call me anytime I can make you feel fine
Look into my bag of tricks if you need a fix
Then I'm your dealer, hey, love, love dealer, hey

All those other pushers they say
They got that good stuff but you already know
You already know what it is
That they can't do what I do, oh no
I'll take you places you never thought you'd go

I can get you so high with the things I do
You get a rush in your veins when we start to move
Don't let these innocent eyes fool you
When I'm on the floor, the floor, the floor

'Cause I could be your dealer
I can be your only friend when you need a
I'll keep you coming back again

You can call me anytime I can make you feel fine
Look into my bag of tricks if you need a fix
Then I'm your dealer, hey, love, love, dealer, hey

You can call me anytime I can make you feel fine
Look into my bag of tricks if you need a fix
Then I'm your dealer, hey, love, love dealer, hey

Baby, I gotta have some more
Eyes roll back and you feel dizzy
What's it gonna take to get a score?
Now, now you got me in your system

Got me like a fiend banging on your door
So now you know what you've been missing
Why don't you meet me on the floor?
And then break

You ain't gotta say that you like it
I can tell by the look in your eyes
Won't you give it a try? You'll be mine

'Cause I could be your dealer
I can be your only friend when you need a
I'll keep you coming back again

You can call me anytime I can make you feel fine
Look into my bag of tricks if you need a fix
Then I'm your dealer

I can be your only friend when you need a
I'll keep you coming back again

You can call me anytime I can make you feel fine
Look into my bag of tricks if you need a fix
Then I'm your dealer, hey, love, love dealer, hey

Love, love dealer, hey
Love, love dealer, hey
Love, love dealer, yeah
