[Chorus]
When I'm weak I want to fly, high
Higher, and higher, and higher
Don't wanna risk my life
Its the only way to..., break the rules, and take over the world
Higher, and higher, and higher
Dont wanna risk my life
Its the only way to..., break the rules, and take over the world

It's the only way to..., break the rules, and take over the world

[Chorus]
When I'm weak I want to fly, high
Higher, and higher, and higher
Don't wanna risk my life
Its the only way to..., break the rules, and take over the world
Higher, and higher, and higher
Its the only way to..., break the rules, and take over the world

[Outro]
Its the only way to..., break the rules, and take over the world
