                        Bài hát: Mr.Right - Nightcore

I'm done with wishful thinking
And with day-dreaming
Of ever finding Mr.
My Everything
Just looking for the right guy
To keep me spinning
And keep my finger free from
That diamond ring 


I'm looking out for fun with
My ladies tonight
So if you think you could be fun
You can come by my side
Don't care what you do
Or if you live with your mom
But if its really fun you've got,
Then baby come give me some. 


REF(2x): No more Mr. Right
No, no more of that, for me
No more perfect night
No more Mr. Wow
With some luck you might
Be Mr. Tonight, baby
You could be my Mr. Right Now 


Now ladies everywhere
Of every nation, black or white
We love dreaming about
Our charming prince or shiny knight
We keep on
Searching
And wishing

And dreaming day and night 

We keep on
Planning
And scheming
In search of Mr. Right
So if you feel you've wasted time
With men who weren't meant to be
Just come out
And say it
And sing along with me 

REF(2x): No more Mr. Right
No, no more of that, for me
No more perfect night
No more Mr. Wow
With some luck you might
Be Mr. Tonight, baby
You could be my Mr. Right Now

Lets just forget all those plans
The rules of getting a man
And let go of those strategies
I'll go on living my life
Without searching so hard
For the right Mr. Right for me 

REF(2x): No more Mr. Right
No, no more of that, for me
No more perfect night
No more Mr. Wow
With some luck you might
Be Mr. Tonight, baby
You could be my Mr. Right Now.
