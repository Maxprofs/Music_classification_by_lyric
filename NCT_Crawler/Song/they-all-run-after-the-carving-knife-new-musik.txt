                        Song: They All Run After The Carving Knife - 

The race is on
For just how long
They attack they defend
To reach the end

See how they run
See how they run
See how they run

They race to the top
Until they drop
And they take the pain
Is it all in vain

See how they run
See how they run
See how they run

See how they run
See how they run
See how they run

Now they've lost their minds
And they seek to find
The very top of the hill
And some of them will

See how they run
See how they run
See how they run

See how they run
See how they run
See how they run

See how they run
See how they run
See how they run

See how they run
See how they run
See how they run

See how they run
See how they run
See how they run

See how they run
See how they run
See how they run
                        
                    |
