                        I thought I'd found the man of my dreams
 Now it seems, this is how the story ends
 He's going to turn me down and say
 Can't we be friends I thought for once it couldn't go wrong
 Not for long, I can see the way this ends
 He's going to turn me down and say
 Can't we be friends Never again, through with love
 Through with men
 They play their game without shame
 And who's to blame I thought I'd found a man I could trust
 What a bust, this is how the story ends
 He's going to turn me down and say
 Can't we be friends Yes, I thought I knew the wheat from the chaff
 What a laugh, this is how our story ends
 I'll let her turn me down and say
 Can't we be friends I acted like a kid out of school
 What a fool, now I see this is the end
 I'll let her turn me down and say
 Can't we be friends Oh what should I give
 Though he gave me the air
 Why should I cry
 He was sigh and wonder why Yes, I should have seen the signal to stop
 What a flop, this is how the story ends
 She's gonna turn me down and say
 Can't we be friends What should I give
 Though he gave me the air
 And why should I cry
 He was sigh and wonder why I should have seen the signal to stop
 What a flop, this is how the story ends
 I let him turn me down and say Can't we be, can't we be, can't we be
 Can't we be, can't we be, can't we be friends
 Oh yes
