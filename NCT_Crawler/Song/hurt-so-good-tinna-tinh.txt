                        Bài hát: Hurt So Good - Tinna Tình

I miss the first kiss you gave me that night
Your heart was beating you hold me tight
Now you’re gone you say goodbye
I’m here and missing your smile
Why you’re so afraid of being with me
What is in your heart let me see
Please don’t ever let me go
Because I know I miss you so
Do you know you are so beautiful
And I’m in love with you
Everytime I see your smile it’s like everything turns blue
I would never ever hurt you baby but I know I’m wrong
