                        **In the heat of the night
We are having a fiesta
We dance until siesta
When the sun come alive (2 times)

I've been waiting the summertime to come
Welcome beaches,lying in the sun
Music playing, people everywhere
No need to worry,the tequila is here
And when the sun goes down we having fun
Coz there will be a party going on...

**In the heat of the night
We are having a fiesta
We dance until siesta
When the sun come alive (2 times)

heat of the night
heat of the night


Life is easy on the holiday
Only problems seem so far away
The bar is open, and everybody sings:
''Excuse me senorita, for you free drinks""
And when the sun goes down we having fun
Cos there will be a party going on..

**In the heat of the night
We are having a fiesta
We dance until siesta
When the sun come alive (2 times)


heat of the night
And when the sun goes down we having fun
Cos there will be a party going on..

In the heat of the night
We are having a fiesta
In the heat of the night,night
We are having a fiesta,

"let's swing it copa de dance !"
"hola senorita, let's go to the beach."
