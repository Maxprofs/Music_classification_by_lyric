                        If you were hurt like I was before
 Ladies, go turn up your radio
 'Cause I'ma sing this one for all, yeah See they complain about our attitude
 Talk about the things we do
 For me, it seems so obvious
 (And I can make you comin', keep comin' back) You're always so up and criticize
 I got my flaws and yes I realize
 I've become so hard to deal with
 Because this cord around my heart is so tight How many times? How many times? How many times?
 I caught you on the phone with her?
 How many times? How many times? How many times?
 Did I take you back and you broke my heart? Oh, this song know how I feel
 You betrayed my love
 And the moral of the story is
 How many times? How many times? Our sister, our sister Mary
 She used to tell us about this in the 90's
 I used to say that I'll never be, no, never never me
 But it is 2011 and I feel I can't get any lower Takin' out my anger
 On any and everybody that comes around
 I've become so hard to deal with
 Because this cord around my heart is so tight How many times? How many times? How many times?
 I caught you on the phone with her?
 How many times? How many times? How many times?
 Did I take you back and you broke my heart? Oh, this song know how I feel
 You betrayed my love
 And the moral of the story is
 How many times? How many times?
 How How many times must I cryin'?
 (Oh, I'm so tired of cryin')
 And how many times should my son see my tears
 Wishin' away
 How many of y'all going through the same thing? I've become so hard to deal with
 Because this cord around my heart is so tight
 I'm so tired How many times? How many times? How many times?
 I caught you on the phone with her?
 How many times? How many times? How many times?
 Did I take you back and you broke my heart? Oh, this song know how I feel
 You betrayed my love
 And the moral of the story is
 How many times? How many times? How many times do I gotta get hurt
 To know it never ain't gon' get no better?
 How many times, ladies, have you been hurt
 And you know in your hear it won't get no better? You, you
 This one's for you
 You, you
 This one's for you
