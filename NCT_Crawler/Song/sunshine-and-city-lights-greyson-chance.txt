                        It's taking us downtown You're watching me, watching, watching me go But I never listen No, I never let you know
Now we're heading uptown Is there something or nothing you wanted to say? 'Cause I need to go now Do you want me to stay? to stay
What you need, to know, is to try And let it go, let it go What you need, to find, is someone Who never will let you go
And oh, and sunshines and city lights Will guide you home And oh, yeah you gotta know That I'll never let you go
Now we're stuck in mid-town Surrounded by people and nothing but sound And we're going nowhere And we are the lost and found
We're all over this town Is there something or nothing you wanted to say? 'Cause I need to go now [ From: -and-city-lights-lyrics-greyson-chance.html ] Do you want me to stay? to stay
What you need, to know, is to try And let it go, let it go What you need, to find, is someone That never will let you go
And oh, and sunshines and city lights Will guide you home And oh, yeah you gotta know That I'll never let you go
And sunshines and city lights, ooh ooh ooh... And sunshines and city lights, hmm...
What you need, to know, is to try And let it go, let it go What you need, to find, is someone Who never will let you go
What you need, to know, is to try And let it go, let it go What you need, to find, is someone That never will let you go
And oh, and sunshines and city lights Will guide you home And oh, yeah you gotta know That I'll never let you go
