                        Bài hát: Rolling In The Deep (Adele - Sbs Kpop Star Special No 4) - Lee Hi

Theres a fire starting in my heart, 
Reaching a fever pitch and its bringing me out the dark, 

Finally, I can see you crystal clear, 
Go ahead and sell me out and Ill lay your sheet bare, 
See how Ill leave with every piece of you, 
Dont underestimate the things that I will do, 

Theres a fire starting in my heart, 
Reaching a fever pitch and its bringing me out the dark, 

The scars of your love remind me of us, 
They keep me thinking that we almost had it all, 
The scars of your love, they leave me breathless, 
I cant help feeling, 

We could have had it all, 
(Youre gonna wish you never had met me), 
Rolling in the deep, 
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep), 
You had my heart inside of your hands, 
(Youre gonna wish you never had met me), 
And you played it to the beat, 
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep), 


Baby, I have no story to be told, 
But Ive heard one on you and Im gonna make your head burn, 
Think of me in the depths of your despair, 
Make a home down there as mine sure wont be shared, 

The scars of your love remind me of us, 
They keep me thinking that we almost had it all, 
The scars of your love, they leave me breathless, 
I cant help feeling, 

We could have had it all, 
(Youre gonna wish you never had met me), 
Rolling in the deep, 
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep), 
You had my heart inside of your hands, 
(Youre gonna wish you never had met me), 
And you played it to the beat, 
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep), 

Throw your soul through every open door, 
Count your blessings to find what you look for, 
Turn my sorrow into treasured gold, 
Youll pay me back in kind and reap just what youve sown, 

We could have had it all, 
(Youre gonna wish you never had met me), 
Rolling in the deep, 
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep), 
You had my heart inside of your hands, 
(Youre gonna wish you never had met me), 
And you played it to the beat, 
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep), 

Could have had it all, 
(Youre gonna wish you never had met me), 
Rolling in the deep, 
(Tears are gonna fall, rolling in the deep), 
You had my heart inside of your hands 

But you played it, 
You played it, 
You played it, 
You played it to the beat
