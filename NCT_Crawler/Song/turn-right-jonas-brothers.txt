[00:-2.00]Jonas Brothers - Turn Right
[00:-1.00]

Pick up all your tears
Throw them in your backseat
Leave without a second glance
Somehow I'm to blame
For this neverending racetrack
You call life

So turn right
Into my arms
Turn right
You won't be alone
You might
Fall off this track sometimes
Hope to see you on the finish line

Driving all your friends out
At a speed they cannot follow
Soon you will be on your own
Somehow I'm to blame
For this neverending racetrack
You call life

Turn rightn (Turn right)
Into my arms
Turn right (Turn right)
You won't be alone
You might (You might)
Fall off this track sometimes
Hope to see you at the finish line
I did all I could
And I gave everything
But you had to go your way
And that road was not for me

So turn right
Into my arms
Turn right
You won't be alone
You might (You might)
Fall off this track sometimes
Hope to see you at the finish line
