                        Bài hát: Pray To God - Calvin Harris, Haim

Ooh, I remember when this road was my own
I pray to God, I just don't know anymore
I pray to God, I just don't know anymore
Ooh, I lost the feeling but I'm tryna hold on
I thought the end of love is what made you strong
I pray to God, I just don't know anymore!

When there's no getting through, I won't hold back
I won't throw everything from the life way back then
I've been laying on the floor, sweeping on the ground
I would give up everything in life if I'd know how!

'Cause I can't stop wondering if I was too late,
If I was too late to see the signs
If I could go back with hands on, look up into the sky
I'd give it, I'd give it, I'd give it
I'd give it to you,
Give it to you!

Ooh, when the moon was shinning bright before mornin'
I made a deal with the stars to keep holdin'
Shinning bright to coming rewrite back home
The lights in my eyes they disappeared,
A vision in my mind about to keep me from feel
I won't let it hold me down, the other way around
I don't want the words to I can't make a sound

'Cause I can't stop wondering
If I was too late to see the signs
If I could go back with hands on, look up into the sky
I'd give it, I'd give it, I'd give it
I'd give it to you,
Give it to you!

Can't hold back, reaching out
I-I-I was living in the heat of the moment
Between us, I told you that
I-I-I was living in the heat of the moment
I'd give it, I-I-I was living in the heat of the moment
I'd give it, I-I-I was living in the heat of the moment
I'd give it, I-I-I was living in the heat of the moment
I'd give it, give it to you give it to you!

I'd give it, I'd give it, I'd give it
I'd give it to you,
Give it to you!

I'd give it, I'd give it, I'd give it
I'd give it to you,
Give it to you!
