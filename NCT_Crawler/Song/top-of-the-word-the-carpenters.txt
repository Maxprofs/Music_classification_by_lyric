Không Lời|

                        Such a feeling's comin' over me 
there is wonder in'mót everything I see 
not a cloud in the sky got the sun in my eyes 
and I won't be suprised if it's a dream 
everything I want the world to be 
is now coming true especially for me 
and the reason is clear it's because you are here 
you're the nearest thing to heaven that I've seen 
I'm on the top of the world lookin' 
down on creation and the only explanation I can find 
is the love that I've found ever since you've been around 
your love's put me at the top of the world. 

something in the wind has learned my name 
and it's tellin' me that things are not the same 
in the leaves on the trees 
and the touch of the breeze 
there's a pleasing sense of happiness for me 
there is only one wish on my mind... 
when this day is through I hope that I will find 
that tomrrow will be 
just the same for you and me 
all I need will be mine if you are here 
I'm on the top of the world lookin' 
down on creation and the only explanation I can find 
is the love that I've found ever since you've been around 
your love's put me at the top of the world. 
I'm on the top of the world lookin' 
down on creation and the only explanation I can find 
is the love that I've found ever since you've been around 
your love's put me at the top of the world.
