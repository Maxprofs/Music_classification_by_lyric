[ar:Mariah Carey]
[al:Mary Christmas]
[offset:500]
O Holy night
The stars are brightly shining
It is the night of our dear Saviour's birth
Long lived the world
In sin and their pining
'Till he appeared and the soul felt its worth
The thrill of hope
The weary world rejoices
For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn
Fall on your knees
O hear the angel voices
O night divine
O night when Christ was born
O night divine
O night, O night divine

The thrill of hope
The weary world rejoices
For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn
Fall on your knees
O hear the angel voices
O night divine
O night when Christ was born
O night divine
O night, O night divine

THE END
