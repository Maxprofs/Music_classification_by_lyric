                        G-g-girl I gotta know
How you dance like that
D-d-dance like that
You dance like that
Cause you’re puttin’ on a show
Can I take you back?
Take you back
I just gotta ask you the...

Show me yours, I’ll show you mine
Don’t you worry, you’re too fine
We got one thing on our minds
And we got plenty of time

[Chorus x2:]
Girl I gotta go, I’m finished with the show
If you wanna *** me, I won’t say no
T-t-t-touchin on my ***
While I’m touchin on your ***
You know that we are gonna ***
Cause I don’t give a ***

I can’t get you outta my mind
With the way you walk
The way you walk
The way you walk
Baby you should be a sign
The way you make me stop
Make me stop
Make me stop

Cause some like fast and some like slow
Ladies come and ladies go
Skip the tell and let’s just show
Cause I wan’t you to know...

[Chorus x2]

(I don’t give a ***)

Girl you know I want you, want you, want you now
You know you want me, want me, want me now
Cause there’s not that much to figure out
So baby let’s get down

[Chorus x2]

(I don’t give a ***)
(I don’t give a ***)
(I don’t give a ***)
                        
                    |
