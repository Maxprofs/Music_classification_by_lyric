                        Bài hát: My Heart Would Take You Back - Shayne Ward

Another night, you're out again
On the town, you're running around
You're playing with my emotions
When will this ever end?
True love is about forgiving
I see your face and my head starts spinning
I'm such a fool, but I can't stop loving you

My fallen angel, well I love you so
My heart would take you back
But my head says to let you go

You're troubled girl, in every way
But I'd take you back
No matter what they say
You got to walk and take the shot
I don't listen to what they say
Even though I'm locked in ???
I can see them all laughing at me on behind
I'm such a fool
But I can't stop loving you

My fallen angel, well I love you so
My heart would take you back
But my head says to let you go

How can you change a simple man
I'm moving on the best I can
Little know you how I do
Forgiving all the pain you've put me through

My fallen angel, well I love you so
My heart would take you back
But my head says to let you go
My heart would take you back
But my head says to let you go
                        
                    |
