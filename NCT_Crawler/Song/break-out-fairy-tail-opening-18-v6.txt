You'd better break out your world 
You go! BREAK OUT! 

Shinjiru kokoro de hajimaru SUTOORII
Ikiteku koto ga "tsuyosa" da to Tell Me 

Kodoku de egai ta Perfect Style mogai te kowashi te ni shita 
Sorezore ni hibi ki kasanaru One Place 
Itsudatte (Believe)
Kimi wa soba ni ite (You're always there for me)
Hontou no yuuki wo mise te kureteita 

I wanna go my way 

BREAK OUT! BREAK OUT! Just do it now yurugi nai kizuna to 
Non-Stop BREAK OUT! BREAK OUT! Believe in my soul motto atsuku nare 
Kakaekire naku te (So they will never know) 
Toozake ta yume mo (That's all right)

BREAK OUT! BREAK OUT! tadoritsuku made 

BREAK OUT! BREAK OUT! 
You'd better break out your world 
Cause you are not alone now 
You go! BREAK OUT!! Give it a kick and "BREAK OUT"
