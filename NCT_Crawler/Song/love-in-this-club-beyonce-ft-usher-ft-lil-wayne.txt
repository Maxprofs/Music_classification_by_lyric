(Usher Talking) 
Im the king, yall know that 
She the queen, came right back 

(Beyonce&Usher :) Yeaaaaa Yeaaaaa 

(Oh Remix!!) 

(Verse 1) 
Usher: 
Now baby girl there aint nothin more that i can say 
You know by now i want it more than anything 
If i walk away and just let you leave 
You'll be stuck in my head like a melody 

Beyonce: 
I know you want it (yea) 
Im hesitating (why?) 
You must be crazy 
I got a man, you got a lady 

Usher: 
I know we here together 
So this must be something special 

(Hook) 
Caus e, you could be anywhere you wanna 
But you decided to be here with me 
No coincidence it was meant to be 
Dont be shy gon' let ya boy get in 
So you can tell all of your friends you was on the remix like 

(Chorus) 
In this club 
In this club 
(Ladies can i put this love up on you one time if you aint scared, say wussup) 
In this club 
In this club 
(They can keep watchin, im not stoppin, baby i dont give up) 
In this club 
In this club 
(Ladies can i put this love up on you one time if you aint scared, say wussup) 
In this club 
In this club 
(They can keep watchin, im not stoppin, baby i dont give up) 

(Verse 2) 

Baby you know i'd be down 
But we cant have all these people staring standin' around 
This right here is only for your eyes to see 
But you getting carried away saying we can do it wherever 
The way you touching me (hey) 
Like no other 

Usher: 
Imma make you feel insane 

Beyonce: 
You r trying your hardest to make me give in 
But imma be down to give you what you wantin' if you keep it up 
I strongly doubt this velvet rope would hold me up 
And i dont want security rollin' up on us (i got ya) 
Im not hesitating i just dont wanna rush 

(Hook) 
Cause, you could be anywhere you wanna 
But you decided to be here with me 
No coincidence it was meant to be 
A mess if i mess around and let you get in 
You gon' tell all of your friends you was on this remix like 

(Chorus) 
In this club 
In this club 
(Fellas can i put this love up on you one time if you aint scared, say wussup) 
In this club 
In this club 
(They can keep watchin, im not stoppin, baby i dont give up) 
In this club 
In this club 
(Ladies can i put this love up on you one time if you aint scared, say wussup) 
In this club 
In this club 
(They can keep watchin, im not stoppin, baby i dont give up) 

(Lil wayne) 
Shawty want a thug, it started with a hug 
And the rest went like this 
I gave her neck a kissy kiss 
She gave my neck a kiss back 
I said we could do it like a stack 
I mean we could do it like a G 
On the couch in V.I.P 
Shawty we can get it on 
Im like shout out to the D.J 
for playin' this song 
Girl, we could act like two damn fools 
Have everybody think we doin a dance move 
Call me, so i can make it juicy for ya 
Meet me in the bathroom and you could be my secret lover girl 
And it started with a hug but now we makin' love in this club 
And we not gonna stop just because 
The people in the crowd are watching us 
Cause we dont give a damn what they say, this is 
Th-the remix baby! 

(Bridge) 
Ushe r: 
Come a little closer let daddy put it on ya 
Need you to know, what happens here stays here 

Beyonce: 
And im, ready and willing 
Mamas got to go 
But your standing at attention 
Keep it on the low 

Usher: 
Aint nobody watching 
Dont worry they cant see us 
I know i got you hot now let me in 

Beyonce: 
You in the club or the car 
Wherever you are 
Run and tell the D.J 
Run it back on replay (heyyy) 

(chorus)
                        
                    |
