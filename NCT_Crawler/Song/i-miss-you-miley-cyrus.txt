                        sha la la la la(2)
You use to call me your angel
Said i was sent staight down from heaven
You'd hold me close in your ams
I love the way you felt so strong
I never wanted you to leave
I wanted you to stay here holding me
(chourus)
I miss you
i miss your smile
And i still shed a tear
Every once in a while
And even though its difrent now
You're still here somehow
My heart won't let you go
And i need you to know
I miss you
sha la la la la
I miss you
. . . . .
And you use to call me your dreamer
And now i'm leavin' out my dream
Oh how i wish you could see
Everything thats happening for me
I'm thinking back on the past
Its true that time it flying by to fast
(repeat chourus)
I know your in the better place( yea)
But i wish i can see your face(oh)
I know your where you need to be
Even know its not here with me
(repeat chourus) (2)
