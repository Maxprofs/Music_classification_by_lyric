                        Bài hát: Just Say Good Bye - Hiroyuki Sawano, Aimer

Thank you mom, I still love you
Your memories in a plastic case
That's stays deep inside my heart
But I've never seen his face
I wish you could rest in peace so long
You left me alone in this world

Say good bye, Stop crying now
We are a part of war in this deep world so
Say good bye, Now I must go
How can we stop war?
I can't see any more in this sad place

Thank you mom I want to hug you
If you were still by my side so
That stays deep in side of my heart
But I've never seen your smile
I wish for them.... they could rest in peace
That you gave me life in this world

Say good bye, Stop crying now
We are a part of war in this deep world so
Say good bye, Now I must go
How can we stop war?
I can't see any more in this sad place

Say good bye, Don't fear hell
We are a part of war in this deep world so
Say good bye, Now I have to go
How can it be?
I can't speak no more

Say good bye, Stop crying now
We are a part of war in this deep world so
Say good bye, Now I must go
How can we stop war?
I can't see any more in this sad place
                        
                    |
