                        Bài hát : Best Day Of My Life - American Authors

I had a dream so big and loud
I jumped so high I touched the clouds
Wo-oah-oah-oah-oah-oh-oh
Wo-oah-oah-oah-oah-oh-oh
I stretched my hands out through the sky
We danced with monsters through the night
Wo-oah-oah-oah-oah-oh-oh
Oah-oah-oah-oah-oah-oh-oh

I'm never gonna look back, woah
I'm never gonna give it up, noo
please don't wake me now

Oo-o-o-o-o-o
This is gonna be the best day of my life
My li-i-i-i-i-ii-ife
Oo-o-o-o-o-oooooo
This is gonna be the best day of my life
My li-i-i-i-i-ii-ife

I howled at the moon with friends
And then the sun came crashing in
Wo-oah-oah-oah-oah-oh-oh
Oah-oah-oah-oah-oah-oh-oh
But all the possibilities
No limits just epiphanies
Wo-oah-oah-oah-oah-oh-oh
Oah-oah-oah-oah-oah-oh-oh

I'm never gonna look back, woah
I'm never gonna give it up, noo
just don't wake me now

Oo-o-o-o-o-o
This is gonna be the best day of my life
My li-i-i-i-i-ii-ife
Oo-o-o-o-o-o
This is gonna be the best day of my life
My li-i-i-i-i-ii-ife

I hear it calling outside my window
I feel it in my soul
Soul
The stars were burning so bright
The sun was out 'til midnight
I say we lose control
Control
This is gonna be the best day of my life
My li-i-i-i-i-ii-ife
Oo-o-o-o-o-o
This is gonna be the best day of my life
My li-i-i-i-i-ii-ife
This is gonna be, this is gonna be, this is gonna be
The best day of my life
Everything is looking up everybody up, now
Oo-o-o-o-o-o
This is gonna be the best day of my l-ii-fe
My li-i-i-i-i-ii-ife
