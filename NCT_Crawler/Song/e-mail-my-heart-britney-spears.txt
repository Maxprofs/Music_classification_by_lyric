E-mail my heart
Britney Spears
by:jj99010

Forever
It's been hours seems like days
Since you went away
And all I do is check the screen
To see if you're okay
You don't answer when I phone
Guess you want to be left alone
So I'm sending you my heart, my soul
And this is what I'll say
I'm sorry, oh so sorry
Can't you give me one more chance
To make it all up to you
E-mail my heart And say our love will never die
And I, I know you're out there
And I know that you still care
E-mail me back and say our love will stay alive
Forever..........
E-mail my heart

I can see you in my mind
Coming on the light
And opening in this letter that I've sent a hundred times
Here's a picture of us two
I look so good on you
And can't you please forgive me
For the hurt I've put you through
I'm sorry, oh so sorry
Can't you give me one more chance
To make it all up to you
E-mail my heart And say our love will never die
And I, I know you're out there
And I know that you still care
E-mail me back and say our love will stay alive
Forever..........
E-mail my heart
I'm sorry, oh so sorry
Can't you give me one more chance
To make it all up to you
E-mail my heart And say our love will never die
And I, I know you're out there
And I know that you still care
(know that you still you care)
E-mail me back and say our love will stay alive
Forever..........
(what you say, what you say, what you say.....)
Forever..(what you say, what you say, what you say)
E-mail my heart

END love Britney Forever..........
