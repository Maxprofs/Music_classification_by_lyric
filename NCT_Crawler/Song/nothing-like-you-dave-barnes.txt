                        Song: Nothing Like You - Dave Barnes

Streets full of people
Souls full of sparks
Days full of color
Turning nights full of stars

Everywhere I've ever been
I come back time and time again

Cause there ain't nothing like you
Ain't nothing like you, ain't nothing like you
There ain't nothing like you
Ain't nothing like you, ain't nothing like you

Bluest skies to the ocean tides
All got something to prove
There ain't nothing like you
Ain't nothing like you

There ain't nothing like you
Ain't nothing like you

My head's full of trouble
My heart just won't sleep
Only you and every one of your kisses
Bring that healing to me

The stories that are mine to tell
All got you and all end well

Cause there ain't nothing like you
Ain't nothing like you, ain't nothing like you
There ain't nothing like you
Ain't nothing like you, ain't nothing like you

Bluest skies to the ocean tides
All got something to prove
There ain't nothing like you
Ain't nothing like you

There ain't nothing like you
There ain't nothing like you

There ain't nothing like the way I feel
When there's nothing but me and you
Your love has got a hold on me
There's nothing that I can do

There's nothing like you
There ain't nothing like you

There ain't nothing like you
Ain't nothing like you, ain't nothing like you
There ain't nothing like you
Ain't nothing like you, ain't nothing like you

Bluest skies to the ocean tides
All got something to prove
There ain't nothing like you
Ain't nothing like you

There ain't nothing like you...
Ain't nothing like you.
