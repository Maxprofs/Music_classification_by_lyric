                        Bài hát: One Call Away - Jeremy Greene

I will go through all give up my life for you
Take out my heart on a plate for you
Coz I aint going away

I would go up the heavens
take the stars right out of the sky
Coz I aint going away

Coz I don't want you to leave me
so I beg you to stay
And baby the aint nothing
That I wouldnt say
So when ever your lonely
I've waited right on your mind
Just pick up the phone baby
Coz I will come away

And I still remember when I met you
I told myself I couldnt get you
That I had you, that I lost you
I would go up the heavens
take the stars rigtt out of the sky
Coz I aint going away

Coz I don't want you to leave me
so I beg you to stay
And baby the aint nothing
That I wouldnt say
So when ever your lonely
I've waited right on your mind
Just pick up the phone baby
Coz I will come away

Girl I don't want you to leave me
so I beg you to stay
And baby the aint nothing
That I wouldnt say
So when ever your lonely
I've waited right on your mind
Just pick up the phone baby
Coz I will come away
                        
                    |
