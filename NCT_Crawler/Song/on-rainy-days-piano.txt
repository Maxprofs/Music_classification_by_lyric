                        Bài hát: On Rainy Days - Piano

I'm trying hard to keep it in
Don't even know where to begin
You're doing this to me
This feeling that I can't explain
What's the use now anyway
I can't fight this emotion

In this bittersweet surprise
You bring me sorrowful goodbyes
When will we, see past the hurting in our eyes?

Misery sinking in the deep
Drowning what was left of us
But I'll hold on forever because

You are like the raindrops falling from above
Giving life to me with your love
Even grey clouds haunting cannot make me leave
On the rainy days I think of you and me

Can we just talk about this please
Can you just tell me what you need
We have to work this out

Nothing could make me walk away
So you don't have to contain
All the torment inside you

I don't know what I can do to make you
Trust me when I say I'm staying
Through hardship, love will still remain

We've both fought battles with the darkness to
Overcome the grief
Baby all that I ask is believe

You are like the raindrops falling from above
Giving life to me with your love
Even grey clouds haunting cannot make me leave
On the rainy days I think of you and me

Just let go
Of all the doubt that lingers in your mind
Just focus on me here by your side
We both agree nothing's easy
But trust in me and maybe
You will find love that makes you complete

I am yours forever, never letting go
Do you trust me enough to know?
Any hurts, pain, tears, love, I accept it all
Take my hand, together we'll keep holding on

I am like the raindrops falling from above
Giving life to you with my love
Even grey clouds haunting cannot make me leave
On the rainy days I think of you and me
                        
                    |
