                        I Wanna Hear Your Heartbeat Half away from having dreams 
On a Sunday, Sunday night Walking all alone in the streets 
On a Sunday, Sunday night But then an angel passed me by 
A little angel made me sigh 
Just when I wanted you A dream came true called love. 

I wanna hear your heartbeat Wanna feel what you need 
Let me stay tonight By your side, by your side 

I wanna hear your heartbeat Share your dreams 
when you''re asleep Let me hold you tight In the night, in the night 

I don''t wanna waste one second Without your lovin'' 
Without you Sunday girl You only got to reach out Reach out to taste my lovin'' Want you so Sunday girl 

Oh, I really want you Heaven sent you down to me 
On a Sunday, Sunday night To rescue me from misery 

On a Sunday, Sunday night You made me leave the past behind I''ve got you always on my mind 

Just when I wanted you A dream came true called love. 
I wanna hear your heartbeat Wanna feel what you need Let me stay tonight By your side, by your side 
I wanna hear your heartbeat Share your dreams when you''re asleep Let me hold you tight In the night, in the night I don''t wanna waste one second Without your lovin'' Without you Sunday girl You only got to reach out Reach out to taste my lovin'' Want you so Sunday girl Oh, I really want you (want you) I wanna hear your heartbeat Wanna feel what you need Let me stay tonight By your side, by your side I wanna hear your heartbeat Share your dreams when you''re asleep Let me hold you tight In the night, in the night I don''t wanna waste one second Without your lovin'' Without you Sunday girl You only got to reach out Reach out to taste my lovin'' Want you so Sunday girl Oh, I really want you (want you)
