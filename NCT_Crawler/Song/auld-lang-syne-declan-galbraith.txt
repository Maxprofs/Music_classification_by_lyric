                        And once again here we are,
family and friends from afar,
Sharing our hopes and our dreams,
Laughing at old memories,
So when that old song starts,
Everyone sing from the heart.


Let's sing...

Should auld acquaintance be forgot,
And never brought to mind,
Should auld acquaintance be forgot,
For the sake of auld lang syne.

Dancing as one, holding hands,
Like people all over the land,
Greeting a friend with a smile,
World is at peace for awhile,
So when that old song starts,
Everyone sing straight from the heart.




Let's sing...

Should auld acquaintance be forgot,
And never brought to mind,
Should auld acquaintance be forgot,
For the sake of auld lang syne.

For auld lang syne, my friends,
For auld lang syne,
We'll take a cup of kindness yet,
For the sake of auld lang syne.

For auld lange syne, my friends,
For auld lange syne,
We'll take a cup of kindness yet,
For the sake of auld lang syne.

For auld lang syne, my friends,
For auld lang syne,
We'll take a cup of kindness yet,
For the sake of auld lang syne.

For auld lange syne, my friends,
For auld lange syne,
We'll take a cup of kindness yet,
For the sake of auld lang syne.
