                        Stop the rain in the night in my heart deep inside.
Hold me
I need you -
Stop the rain in the night
our love can't sunrive.
It's now or never
stop the rain in the night.

You and me - it's a tragedy with an open end.
Take a chance for a new romance
we're cryin' for love.
Every day
every night
we're bound up in a hard fight.
Joy and tears side by side
that's our life


Stop the rain in the night in my heartdeep inside. . . .

Every day
every night
we're bound up in a hard fight.
Joy and tears side by side
that's our life.
Stop the rain in the night in my heart deep inside.
Hold me
I need you - stop the rain in the night.
Stop the rain m the night. (3x)
