                        She wants me to come over
I can tell her eyes don't lie
She's calling me in the dark
She moves, I swear the room where the lights up like the sky
Confidence like a rock star

I wanna put my hands on her hands
Feel the heat from her skin
Get reckless in the starlight
I'm moving to the beat of her heart
I was so lost until tonight, tonight

I found you, in the darkest hour
I found you, in the pouring rain
I found you, when I was on my knees
And your light brought me back again
Found you in the river of pure emotions
I found you, my only truth
I found you, and the music playing

I was lost 'til I found you, you, you
'Til I found you, you, you

The night is getting colder
And I can't come off this high
I don't want this here to end
I know she feels the same
Cause I can see it in her eyes
She says, "Can we start again?"

I wanna put my hands on her hands
Feel the heat from her skin
Get reckless in the starlight
She's moving to the beat of my heart
We were so lost until tonight, tonight

I found you, in the darkest hour
I found you, in the pouring rain
I found you, when I was on my knees
And your light brought me back again
Found you in the river of pure emotions
I found you, my only truth
I found you, and the music playing

I was lost 'til I found you, you, you
'Til I found you, you, you

I said, people
We're all looking for love tonight
But sometimes we can't see it
We're all blinded by the light
And we all get love, all get love
Searching for that peace of mind
Just when I have given up
Were looking for some kind of sign

That's when I found you, you, you
I found you, you, you
I found you, you, you
I found you, you, you

I found you, in the darkest hour
I found you, in the pouring rain
I found you, when I was on my knees
And your light brought me back again
Found you in the river of pure emotions
I found you, my only truth
I found you, and the music playing

I was lost 'til I found you
                        
                    |
