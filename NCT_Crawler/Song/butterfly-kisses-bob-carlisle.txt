                        There's two things I know for sure
 She was sent here from heaven
 And she's daddy's little girl
 As I drop to my knees by her bed at night
 She talks to Jesus and I close my eyes
 And I thank God for all of the joy in my life
 Oh but most of all For butterfly kisses after bedtime prayer
 Stickin' little white flowers all up in her hair
 Walk beside the pony daddy it's my first ride
 I know the cake looks funny daddy but I sure tried Oh with all that I've done wrong
 I must have done something right
 To deserve a hug every mornin'
 And butterfly kisses at night Sweet 16 today
 She's lookin' like her mama a little more every day
 One part woman the other part girl
 To perfume and make up from ribbons and curls
 Trying her wings out in a great big world
 But I remember Butterfly kisses after bedtime prayer
 Stickin' little white flowers all up in her hair
 You know how much I love you daddy
 But if you don't mind
 I'm only gonna kiss you on the check this time Oh with all that I've done wrong
 I must have done something right
 To deserve her love every mornin'
 And butterfly kisses at night All the precious time
 Like the wind the years go by
 Precious butterfly
 Spread your wings and fly She'll change her name today
 She'll make a promise and I'll give her away
 Standing in the bride room just staring at her
 She asked me what I'm thinkin'
 And I said I'm not sure
 I just feel like I'm loosin' my baby girl
 And she leaned over Gave me butterfly kisses with her mama there
 Stickin' little white flowers all up in her hair
 Walk me down the isle daddy
 It's just about time
 Does my wedding gown look pretty daddy?
 Daddy's don't cry Oh with all that I've done wrong
 I must have done something right
 To deserve her love every mornin'
 And butterfly kisses I couldn't ask God for more than this is what love is
 I know I've got to let her go but I'll always remember
 Every hug in the mornin' and butterfly kisses
                        
                    |
