                        Bài hát: Kinda Don't Care - Justin Moore

I've been watchin' my weight
I've been tryin' to do right
I've been tryin' to get a little more sleep at night
I've been workin' like a dog
I've been goin' to church
Yeah, I've been bein' so damn good, it hurts

I kinda wanna light up a couple smokes
Kinda want some Crown mixed in my Coke
Kinda wanna hole up in some corner booth somewhere
I kinda wanna find a pretty little thing
That's kinda like me, don't want no strings
Knowin' in the morinin' that it ain't goin' nowhere
But tonight, I kinda don't care

No, I don't wanna think
'Bout nothin' at all
I don't wanna sit around here all night, wishin' you'd call
I kinda wanna drown your memory
Kinda wanna raise my finger to all them used to be's

I kinda wanna light up a couple smokes
Kinda want some Crown mixed in my Coke
Kinda wanna hole up in some corner booth somewhere
I kinda wanna find a pretty little thing
That's kinda like me, don't want no strings
Knowin' in the morinin' that it ain't goin' nowhere
But tonight, I kinda don't care

Yeah, tonight I kinda wanna light up a couple smokes
Kinda want some Crown mixed in my Coke
Kinda wanna hole up in some corner booth somewhere
I kinda wanna find a pretty little thing
That's kinda like me, don't want no strings
Knowin' in the morinin' that it ain't goin' nowhere
But tonight, I kinda don't care
Kinda don't care
Hell, if you don't care
Then I kinda don't care

Aww hell, I don't care
