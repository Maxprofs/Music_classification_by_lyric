                        1. Someone once told me that you have to choose
What you win or lose
You can’t have everything.

Don’t you take chances
You might feel the pain
Don’t you love in vain
’cause love won’t set you free.

I can’t stand by the side
And watch this life pass me by
So unhappy
But safe as could be.

[Chorus:]
So what if it hurts me
So what it I break down
So what if this world just throws me off the edge
My feet run out of ground
I gotta find my place
I wanna hear my sound
Don’t care about all the pain in front of me
I just trying to be happy
(I just wanna be happy, yeah).

2. Holding on tightly
Just can’t let go
Just trying to play my role
Happy lyrics on ***
Slowly disappear.

But all these days
They feel like they’re they’re same
Just different faces
Different place
Get me out of here.

I can’t stand by the side
Ooh, no
And watch this life pass me by
Pass me by.

[Bridge:]
Oh, happy
Oh

So when it turns that I can see
This rope
Victim
Don’t say anything.
                        
                    |
