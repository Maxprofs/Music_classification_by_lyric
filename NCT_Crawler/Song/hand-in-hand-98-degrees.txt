                        There's one thing I'm sure of is
that we will always be
Even though the road seems
to get a little rough
It's for you I live I can do anything
And it will never be too much

In my darkest hour you are
there to light the way
And when I'm down you
always lift me up again
Oh, oh, oh, oh
You know me
better than I know myself
You comfort me and let me know
with you I'm gonna win

Chorus:
Walk with me hand in hand
We help each other
understand how to go through
There will never be a day
that we'll grow apart
So we'll forever be
together hand in hand

Sometimes I'm wrong
and even in that case
You didn't go away you
stayed right next to me
As time goes on I realize
that you're for me
And I will love you for eternity

(Verse 2)

(Chorus)
                        
                    |
