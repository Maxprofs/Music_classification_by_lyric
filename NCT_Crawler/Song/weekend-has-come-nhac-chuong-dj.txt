                        Bài hát: Weekend Has Come (Nhạc Chuông) - DJ

Weekend has com I see you again,
Monday to Fri,
I wait for the time with you and
All my love I lay in your arms,
I kissing your lips

Be no more away from you so 
That is the time I'm working on me
Forgot all the lone-ly nights with TV, I think
That will be never, my future I swear
Now what we need a comeback again forever
                        
                    |
