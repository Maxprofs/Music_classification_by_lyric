                        Bài hát: I'm Not Her (Acoustic Version) - Clara Mae

Been two years our memory are blured
Haven't heard your voice, no, not a word
But still they
They talk about the thing we was
They talk about us
I don't know the thing that you have heart

She's standing on your feet
With our song on repeat
She painted every role of us
She's taking off her clothes
In the bed you kept me warm
Heard she's everything I never was 

[Chorus] 
No, I'm not her, no, never will 
Never gonna move like her, move like 
I'm not her, no, never will 
Never gonna look like her, be like 
I'm not her, I'm not her (no) 
At least that's what I've heard 

[Verse 2] 
Me, myself, just stumble under glue 
The thing I thought was missing wasn't you 
And now I'm no longer scared to meet the night 
I'm doing alright 
Me, myself, we started something new
                        
                    |
