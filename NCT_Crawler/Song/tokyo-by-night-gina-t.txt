Follow my car, I'll show you how is life.
Sensual people, it's something can be magic in life.
Take my hand and you will understand.
Mysteri es like dust will bring you free train, this is dream.
Tokyo by night, city's full of life,
You see in my eyes, Tokyo by night.
Tokyo by night, shining me your light
I will lead you through, Tokyo by night.
Follow me boy, I'll lead you through the night.
Exit the car as if don't chase the whole traffic in moonlight.
Take your chance, enjoy this place all lives.
Sweet charming ladies, erotic of sence, see full smile.
Tokyo by night, city's full of life,
You see in my eyes, Tokyo by night.
Tokyo by night, shining me your light
I will lead you through, Tokyo by night.
