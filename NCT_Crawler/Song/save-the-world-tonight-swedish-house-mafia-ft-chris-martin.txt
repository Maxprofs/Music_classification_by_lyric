                        1)
Into the streets
We're coming out
We never sleep
Never get tired
So urban feels
In suburban life

(*)
Turn the crowd up now
We'll never back down
Shoot down a skyline
And watching it on prime time
Turn up the love now
Listen up now, turn up the love

Chorus:
Who's gonna save the world tonight?
Who's gonna bring me back to life?
We're gonna make it, you and I
We're gonna save the world tonight

OHOHOHOHOOHOH (3x)

2)
We're far from home, it's for the better
What we dream, it's all that matters
We're on our way, united

(*)

(Chorus)
                        
                    |
