                        Bài hát: Do What U Want (Clean Version) - Lady Gaga, R. Kelly

[Verse 1: Lady Gaga]
I feel good, I walk along
But then I trip upon myself and I fall off
I stand up, and then I'm OK
But then you break that chip
That makes me want to scream

[Pre-Chorus: Lady Gaga]
So do what you want
What you want with my body
Do what you want
Don't stop, let's party
Do what you want
What you want with my body
Do what you want
What you want with my body

Write what you want
Say what you want bout me
If you’re wondering
Know that I’m not sorry
Do what you want
What you want with my body
What you want with my body

[Chorus: Lady Gaga]
You can’t have my heart
And you won't use my mind but
Do what you want (with my body)
Do what you want with my body
You can’t stop my voice cause
You dont own my life but
Do what you want (with my body)
Do what you want (with my body)

[Verse 2: R. Kelly]
Early morning, longer nights
Time for private flights
Crazy schedule, fast life
I wouldn't trade it in
Cause it's our life
(now let's slow it down)

I could be the drink in your cup
I could be the green in your blunt
Your pusha man, ya I got what you want
You want to escape all of the crazy ***
You're the mailman, I'm the president
I love to hear you sing, girl

[Pre-Chorus 2: R. Kelly]
Do what I want
Do what I want with your body
Do what I want
Do what I want with your body
Back of the club, taking shots, getting naughty
No invitations, it's a private party
Do what I want
Do what I want with your body
Do what I want
Do what I want with your body
Ya we taking these haters and we roughin' em up
And we laying in the cut like we don't give a ***

[Chorus]

[Verse 3: Lady Gaga]
Sometimes I'm scared I suppose
If you ever let me go
I would fall apart
If you break my heart
So just take my body
And don't stop the party

[Chorus]

[Outro: Lady Gaga]
Do what you want with me
What you want with my body
Do what you want with me
What you want with my body
Do what you want with me
What you want with my body
Do what you want with me
What you want with my body
                        
                    |
