                        Bài hát: Third Day Of A Seven Day Binge - Marilyn Manson

We've only reached the third day of a seven-day binge
And I can already see your name disintegrating from my lips
We've only reached the third day of a seven-day binge
I can already see your name disintegrating from my lips

I can't decide if you wear me out or wear me well
I just feel like I'm condemned to wear someone else's hell
We've only reached the third day of a seven-day binge
I can already see your name disintegrating from my lips

I got bullets, in the booth
Rather be your victim, than be with you
I got bullets, in the booth
Rather be your victim, than be with you

I've reached the third day of a seven-day binge
I can already see your name disintegrating from my lips

I'd rather be your victim, than to be with you
Rather be your victim, than be with you
                        
                    |
