                        Bài hát: Childhood Memory - Yiruma

When I was a child I was very naughty. 
The people said' I look like a boy' That was right!. 
I used to play football , I used to climbed trees and play marbles with boys that sort of things... 
I was a shrewish child If the person joked me and maked me feel angry I could fight him or her. 
I remember I nearly burnt my house. 
At that moment I was playing matches I turned it on and threw its away. 
Unfortunately the flame flew to the blanket. 
The blanket was burning into flames , my neighbour found the flames from my house. 
They shouted' help , help" and they sloved successful flames. 
At that times I was frightened , I didn't know to have to do. 
I thought in my mind I'd give a hiding If my parent went home. 
I ran away my house. 
I arrived my friend's house and I stayed one day at there. 
when my parent found me I was very very afraid of them . 
I thought they'd hurt me but when I came back my home , they just said me Did you know your mistakes? 
I said : yes , I know. 
Then they punished me to stand corner, they didn't hurt me. 
It was really lucky!!
