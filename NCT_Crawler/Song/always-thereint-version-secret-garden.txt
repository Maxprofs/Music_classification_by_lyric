                        When I less than I should be
 And I just can't face the day
 When darkness falls surround me
 And I just can't find my way
 When my eyes don't clearly see
 And I stumble through it all
 You I leaned upon, You keep me strong
 And you rise me when I Fall

 Chorus:
 You are there when I most need you
 You are there so constantly
 You come shining through
 You always do.....
 You are always there for me

 When life brings me to my knees
 When my back against the wall
 You are standing there right with me
 Just to keep me standing tall
 Though a burden I may be
 You don't weary you don't rest
 You are reaching out to carry me
 And I know my heaven-blest

 Chorus 2x
