                        Bài hát: Domino - Jessie J

I'm feeling sexy and free.
Like glitter's raining on me.
You're like a shot of pure gold.
I think I'm 'bout to explode.

I can taste the tension like a cloud of smoke in the air.
now I'm breathing like I'm running cause you're taking me there.
Don't you know~...you spin me out of control~
Oh Oh Oh Oh We can do this all night.
turn this love to skin tight.
baby c'mon. Oh Oh Oh Oh
Booming like a drum bass
Sparkling up a rhythm
Baby c'mon Oh Oh Oh Oh 
Rock my world into the sunlight.
make this dream the best I've ever known.
Dirty dancing in the moonlight
Take me down like I'm a domino

You got me loosing my mind~
My heart beats out of time
I'm seeing Holywood stars
You strum me like a guitar
I can taste the tension like a cloud of smoke in the air.
now I'm breathing like I'm running cause you're taking me there.
Don't you know~...you spin me out of control~
Oh Oh Oh Oh We can do this all night.
turn this love to skin tight.
baby c'mon. Oh Oh Oh Oh
Booming like a drum bass
Sparkling up a rhythm
Baby c'mon Oh Oh Oh Oh 
Rock my world into the sunlight.
make this dream the best I've ever known.
Dirty dancing in the moonlight
Take me down like I'm a domino
Every second is a highlight
When we touch don't ever let me go
Dirty dancing in the moonlight
Take me down like I'm a domino

Ooh baby baby got me feeling so right
Ooh baby baby dancing in the moonlight
Ooh baby baby got me feeling so right
Ooh baby baby Ooh ooh ooh ooh

Rock my world into the sunlight.
make this dream the best I've ever known.
Dirty dancing in the moonlight
Take me down like I'm a domino
Every second is a highlight
When we touch don't ever let me go
Dirty dancing in the moonlight
Take me down like I'm a domino.
 Domino by Jessie J.
