[Intro]
You know I'm gonna hit it on the radio
You know I'm gonna put it on my video
I know you gon be turnin' up the volume
I know you wanna split me up in stereo


[Chorus]
Wheels
Maybe if you pay my bills
Maybe you can get these feels
Maybe we can make a deal, deal, deal, deal, deal, deal
Let me get your wheels, your wheels wheels

[Verse 1]
We don't talk, no trust
Babe, it's just for fun
You can ride shotgun
I'ma hit and run

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I been there, done that
And I got lost but I made it back
And I been hurt and it's all wack
So let me get that

[Chorus]
Wheels
Maybe if you pay my bills
Maybe you can get these feels
Maybe we can make a deal, deal, deal, deal, deal, deal
Let me get your wheels, your wheels wheels

[Post-Chorus]
You know I'm gonna hit it on the radio
You know I'm gonna put it on my video
I know you gon be turnin' up the volume
I know you wanna split me up in stereo

[Verse 2]
I know you couldn't sleep last night
'Cause you been thinkin' how you used to have it
Gonna have to work this town
'Cause a girl like me don't need nobody
If I'm gonna let go, do what I say so, oh
'Cause you had your way bro
Played too many games with my heart

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I been there, done that
And I got lost but I made it back
And I been hurt and it's on wax
So let me get that

[Chorus]
Your wheels
Baby if you pay my bills (baby if you pay my bills)
Maybe you can get these feels (you can get these feels oh)
Maybe we can make a deal, deal, deal, deal, deal, deal
Let me get your wheels, your wheels, wheels

[Post-Chorus]
You know I'm gonna hit it on the radio
You know I'm gonna put it on my video
I know you gon be turnin' up the volume
I know you wanna split me up in stereo (wheels)
You know I'm gonna hit it on the radio
You know I'm gonna put it on my video
I know you gon be turnin' up the volume
I know you wanna split me up in stereo (wheels)
You know I'm gonna hit it on the radio
You know I'm gonna put it on my video
I know you wanna split me up in stereo
I know you wanna split me up in stereo
You know I'm gonna hit it on the radio
You know I'm gonna put it on my video
I know you wanna split me up in stereo
I know you wanna split me up in stereo

[Chorus]
Baby if you pay my bills
Maybe you can get these feels
Maybe we can make a deal, deal, deal, deal, deal, deal
Let me get your wheels, your wheels wour wheels

[Outro]
