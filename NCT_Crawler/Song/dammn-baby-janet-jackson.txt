                        Bài hát: Dammn Baby - Janet Jackson

Ya same old song
Is dragging me down
Not good for my body
Change it up
Cuz it ain't nothing like having your own id
My lanes been stuck
I've never been afraid
To switch oh no not me
And they show me love
For being original

And tell em make room
Shake the room
Bang bang ya gon gon get it
You gotta get up off that grey line
And can't nobody tell you
What you can't do
Shut that down automatic
And I'll guarantee they'll fall in line
And watch em all go

Dammn baby baby
Watch em all go
Dammn baby baby
Watch em all go
Dammn baby baby
Watch em all go
Dammn baby baby

A brand new movement
That started with a
Conversation in a cafe
It's all about love
And how we ain't never gon let
Words get in the way
When you're giving it up
It's never what you say
It's saying what you do
You wanna show me love
Let's keep that conversation going honey

And tell em make room
Shake the room
Bang bang ya gon gon get it
You gotta get up off that grey line
And can't nobody tell you
What you can't do
Shut that down automatic
And I'll guarantee they'll fall in line
And watch em all go

Dammn baby baby
Watch em all go
Dammn baby baby
Watch em all go
Dammn baby baby
Watch em all go
Dammn baby baby

And now, the breakdown (plush)
Gonna break it down, break it down, break it down
Gonna break it down, break it down
Gonna break it down, break it down
Ho!
Watchin em all go
Daamn
OOh (ho!)
Watchin em all go
Daamn baby
Ho!
Watchin em go
D-daamn baby
Ho!
Come on!

And tell em make room
Shake the room
Bang bang ya gon gon get it
You gotta get up off that grey line
And can't nobody tell you
What you can't do
Shut that down automatic
And I'll guarantee they'll fall in line
And watch em all go

Dammn baby baby
Watch em all go
Dammn baby baby
Watch em all go
Dammn baby baby
Watch em all go
Dammn baby baby
Watch em all go
Dammn baby baby
Watch em all go
Dammn baby baby
Watch em all go
Dammn baby baby
Watch em all go
Dammn baby baby

Daamn
