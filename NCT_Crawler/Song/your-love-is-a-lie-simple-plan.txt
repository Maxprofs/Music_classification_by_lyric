                        I fall asleep by the telephone.
It's 2 o'clock and I'm waiting up alone.
And tell me where have you been?

I found a note with another name.
You blow a kiss, but it just don't feel the same.
'Cause I can feel that you're gone.

Can't bite my tongue forever,
While you try to play it cool.
You can hide behind your story,
But don't take me for a fool.

[Chorus]
You can tell me that there's nobody else. [but I feel it]
You can tell me that you're home by yourself. [but I see it]
You can look into my eyes and pretend all you want
But I know, I know, your love is just a...lie. [lie x2]
It's nothing but a...lie. [lie x2]

You look so innocent,
But the guilt in your voice gives you away.
Yeah, you know what I mean.
How does it feel when you kiss when you know that I trust you.
And do you think about me when he *s you?
Could you be more obscene?

So don't try to say you're sorry,
Or try to make it right.
Don't waste your breath because it's too late, it's too late.

You can tell me that there's nobody else. [but I feel it]
You can tell me that you're home by yourself. [but I see it]
You can look into my eyes and pretend all you want
But i know, i know, your love is just a...lie. [lie] lie [lie]
It's nothing but a...lie [lie] lie [lie]
You're nothing but a LIE!


You can tell me that there's nobody else. [but I feel it]
You can tell me that you're home by yourself. [but I see it]
You can look into my eyes and pretend all you want
but I know, [know x2]
I know, your love is just a lie. [know]
I know, you're nothing but a...lie! [lie!] lie! [lie!]
You're nothing but a...lie! [lie!] lie! [lie!]
Your love is just a...LIE!
