                        I have been in love and been alone
I have traveled over many miles to find a home
There’s that little place inside of me
That I never thought could take control of everything
But now I just spend all my time
With anyone who makes me feel the way she does

[Chorus:]

‘cause I only feel alive when I dream at night
Even though she’s not real it’s all right
‘cause I only feel alive when I dream at night
Every move that she makes holds my eyes
And I fall for her every time

I’ve so many things I want to say
I’ll be ready when the perfect moment comes my way
I had never known what’s right for me
‘til the night she opened up my heart and set it free
But now I just spend all my time
With anyone who makes me feel the way she does

[Chorus:]

‘cause I only feel alive when I dream at night
Even though she’s not real it’s all right
‘cause I only feel alive when I dream at night
Every move that she makes holds my eyes
And I fall for her every time

Now I just spend all my time
With anyone who makes me feel the way she does

[Chorus 2x :]

‘cause I only feel alive(only feel alive) when I dream at night(when you'r by my side)
Even though she’s not real it’s all right(that’s alright baby that’s all right)
‘cause I only feel alive when I dream at night
Every move that she makes holds my eyes(holds my eyes)
                        
                    |
