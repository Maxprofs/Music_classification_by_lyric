                        [Verse 1: T.I.]
Okay we walk off in this bitch
Ballin in this bitch
Hoppin' out the lambos and ferraris in this bitch
Poppin' bottles with a thick red super model bitch
They be talking alot of that but they cant do alot of this
Ay, rico told me turn the lights on
So I grab the audemar and threw the ice on
Imma big dawg, got a pistol
A lot of n-ggas rapping aint none this raw
They like, ay look at T.I., ballin' in the V.I.
Bunch of bad bitches with a [??] looking like alliyah
We just pull up, hop out
Go in, show out
Buy the whole bar, pop bottles go hard

[Verse 3: Lil Wayne]
Ain't no n-gga like a Young Money N-gga
Pop that p-ssy like a gun, pull the trigga
Shake that ass like a salt shaker
I keep a L lit up like an elevator
Bitch shake it like a dog, hop like a frog, ride it like a horse
I throw that dick like darts
Drink all muddy, flag all bloody
I'm killin' these hoes like that n-gga Ted Bundy
I'm a good looking rapper, I ain't trying stunt
Imma fire my blunt like Donald Trump
Where you at hoe? Where you at hoe?
Can a n-gga stick key up in ya back door, Tunechi
