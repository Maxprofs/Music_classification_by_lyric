                        Bài hát: Chillin' Like A Villain - Sofia Carson, Cameron Boyce, Booboo Stewart, Mitchell Hope

Let me tell you something you can really trust
Everybody's got a wicked side
I know you think that you could never be like us
Watch and learn so you can get it right

You need to drag your feet
You need to nod your head
You need to lean back
Slp through the cracks
You need to not care(Uh, you need to not stare)
You need a whole lotta help(You need to not be yourself)

You wanna cool
Let me show you how 
Need to break the rules
I can show you how
And once you catch this feeling
Yeah, once you catch this felling

You'll chillin' chillin'
Oh, chillin' like a villain(Chillin')
Chillin' like a villain(Hey)
Chillin' like a villain
Chillin' like(~2)Hey, a villain

You draw attention when you act like that
Let us teach you how to disappear 
You look like you would lose a fight to an alley cat
You gotta be wrong to get it right round here

You need to watch your back
You need to creep around 
You need to slide your smooth
Don't make a sound
And if you want it take it
And if you can't take it break it
If you care about your health(Seriously, you need to not be your self)

You wanna be cool
Let me show you how
Need to break the rules
I can show you how
And once you catch this feeling
Yeah, once you catch this felling

You'll chillin' chillin'
Oh, chillin' like a villain(Chillin')
Chillin' like a villain(Chillin')
Chillin' like a villain(Hey,Chillin' )
Chillin', chillin' like

I really wanna be bad a lot
And I'm giving it my best shot( But it's hard being what I'm not)
(Well if you don't, You're gonna get us caught)

He right we gotta stay low key 
Now show us how bad you can be
Like this?Yeah yeah yeah yeah(Like this? Yeah)

Oh yeah, I think I got this
Let's go, I'm ready to rock this

And I ain't gonna thank you for your help
I think I found the worst in myself 

You wanna be cool 
Let me show you how
Need to break the rules
I can show you how
And once you catch this feeling
Yeah, once you catch this felling

Chillin' like a villain(chillin')
Chillin' like a villain(chillin')
Chillin' like a villain(chillin')
Chillin' like a villain(chillin')
Chillin' like a villain(chillin' hey)

CHILLIN' LIKE A VILLAIN
