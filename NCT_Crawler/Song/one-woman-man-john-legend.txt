                        Bài hát: One Woman Man - John Legend

[Verse 1]
I always believed that love will surrender
And I wouldn't go down without a fight
I always left room for other contenders
'Cause I might change my mind

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Damn, I used to be so cold
We never ever get too close
Didn't ever wanna lose control
But from the moment that I tasted
I knew that I would have to chase it
You say hold up, I won't you to be

[Chorus]
A one woman man
A one woman man, oh
Want you all to my side
Don't want nobody else
Oh, you love it
Oh, you love it
Won't you be
A one woman man (one woman)
A one woman man, oh (one woman)

[Verse 2]
You made me believe that love was forever
And love could sustain us through every fight
I'll let go of all of the other
Pretenders they were wasting my time

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I never thought that I would say this
But I can see us having babies
I could see it from the stars
That I might give you my heart
From the moment that I met you
Knew that I would never let you
Slip away, it's okay
You can make me

[Chorus]
A one woman man
A one woman man, oh
Want you all to my side
Don't want nobody else
Oh, you love it
Oh, you love it
Won't you be
A one woman man (one woman)
A one woman man, uh (one woman)

[Bridge]
I can never say I loved you
I kept all my gold
But you broke in my house
You've stolen my heart
Now I've given you the key
Got all of you for all of me
But baby, I promise you'll be

[Chorus]
A one woman man, oh
Want you all to myself
Don't want nobody else
Oh, I love it
Oh, they love it
I can be
A one woman man (one woman)
A one woman man, uh (one woman)
                        
                    |
