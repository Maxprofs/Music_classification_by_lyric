                        Why you rushing me baby
 It's only us
 I don't wanna die tonight baby
 So let me sip this slow
 I'll give you what you called for
 Just let me get me in my zone
 I'll be making love to her through you
 So let me keep my eyes closed
 And I wont see a damn thing
 I can't feel a damn thing
 But if I touch you right
 I wont see a damn thing
 I can't feel a damn thing
 But I'ma touch you right

 I'ma touch you right, ooh yeah (let me set this slow)
 I'ma touch you right (let me get inside my zone)
 I'ma touch you right (just let me)

 And I believe until I fall, ooh yeah
 And I don't give a damn
 I felt the girl before

 I left it over her, baby
 I didn't need no-one
 But I'm here tonight baby
 I've been alone for too long
 Ohh, oh yeah
 So, wont say a damn thing

 I can't feel a damn thing
 But I'ma touch you right

 I can't see a damn thing
 I can't feel a damn thing

 But I'ma touch you right

 I'ma touch you right, ooh yeah (let me set this slow)
 I'ma touch you right (let me get inside my zone)
 I'ma touch you right (just let me)

 Woah, all these broken hearts on that pole
 Man if pole dancers are art you know how many fuckin' artists I know
 Got some new bills in the mail
 Got some big favours I owe
 Got some good things ahead of me
 When these bad bitches let go
 Well, girl lets go
 Walk your broken heart through that door
 Sit yo s*** ass on that couch
 Wipe that lipstick off of your mouth
 I take it slow
 She in love with my crew
 She said make enough so I can try some
 I thought taking drugs jus' aint you
 Yeah girl, just be you
 And I do this *** for my hometown
 It being going down it aint new
 That's that north north, that up top
 That ovo and that xo
 Your girlfriend at our next show
 But it's all good, don't stress though
 First night f-ck, never really planned it
 Take a deep breath, no need to panic
 Lips so French, ass so Spanish
 You don't really like attention, I don't know if she gon manage out here
 But she got me all up in my zone
 Said she like the view I got in this place
 *** I did all of that on my own
 Oh yeah
