                        The first time that I saw you
 You were dancin' on the beach
 Poetry in motion
 But you seemed so out of reach
 And the waves were breakin' 'round you
 In the California sunset, yea I made a wish to know you
 And touch your golden hair
 You turned around and looked at me
 And paradise was there
 Baby, I remember the way you took my hand
 Yesterday Time stood still
 As we walked into the night together
 The memory is locked in our hearts forever
 It seems just like yesterday
 Time stood still We found a little seaside bar
 High above the rocks
 You were drinking white wine
 And I was doing shots
 I wondered if you'd stay the night
 You just took my hand and led the way Time stood still
 As we made love through the night together
 The memory is locked in our hearts forever
 Time stood still
 Time stood still
 The memory is locked in our hearts forever
 Oh yea I thought that I'd seen love before
 What you showed me, well that's something more
 Love found two strangers walkin' on the shore
 We threw our watches in the sea
 I looked at you, you looked at me
 And time stood still We made a fire on the beach that night
 And watched the seagulls circle in the mornin' light
 Maybe there are some things
 We're not meant to understand anyway Time stood still
 Love goes on forever
 The memory is burned in our hearts forever
 Oh yes
 Time stood still
 The moment's gone forever
 But I will love you till
 Time stands still in our hearts forever
 Oh yea
 Time stood still
 Time stood still
 Time stands still in our hearts forever
 Seems just like yesterday
 Time stood still
 Time stands still
 Time stood still
 Oh yea
 Time stood still
 Forever
