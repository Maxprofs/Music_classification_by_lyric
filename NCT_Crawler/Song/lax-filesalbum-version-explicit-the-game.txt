                        [Intro:]
 Put your lighters up if you want to
 Pull your mutha***in Dodger cap
 Over your mutha***in eyes
 Until you can't see ***
 I want you to go blind nigga
 So you can feel how I felt
 When I was in that mutha***in coma

 [Chorus:]
 Raised in the city of angels
 Where it's safe and dangerous
 Switch lanes so stranger drive slow (drive slow)
 Where bangers and gangstas,
 Fast women and dank are just part of a face that we show
 We got mountains and ocean, we move in slow motion
 Off that sticky you walk up to go,
 I swear, ain't nothin better there
 That's why we all take our hats off to you
 The one more

 [The Game]
 Come to my hood (hood), look at my block (block)
 That's that project building
 Yeah, that's where I got shot (shot)
 Cause I was more hood than Suge, had more rocks than Jay
 More scars on my face than the original Scarface
 Or the homeboy Scarface
 Al Pacino couldn't be no gangsta
 Deniro in Casino, he no gangsta
 Wanna be, wanna see one, get a shovel
 Dig Tookie up nigga, cause he know gangstaz
 Niggaz think cause they watched "Menace" a couple times
 Seen Cube in "Boyz N the Hood" and pressed rewind
 That you could survive,
 When a real Crip run up on your car and flex the nine
 You must be out of yo mind
 A real Blood will put you out of yo mind
 Just stay the *** up outta my hood
 Where my niggaz take you up out of yo shine
 It ain't a movie dawg
 Hell yeah this a real ***in uzi dawg
 I'm about to hop inside my Impala
 Try to keep up, don't lose me ya'll

 [Chorus:]
 Raised in the city of angels
 Where it's safe and dangerous
 Switch lanes so stranger drive slow (drive slow)
 Where bangers and gangstas,
 Fast women and dank are just part of a face that we show
 We got mountains and ocean, we move in slow motion
 Off that sticky you walk up to go,
 I swear, ain't nothin better there
 That's why we all take our hats off to you
 The one more

 [The Game]
 I know the real O-Dog
 And that nigga know the real Game
 I call him Lorenz Tate
 And he ain't never been in no gang
 But he been to my house (house)
 And he sat on my couch (couch)
 While I put one in the air
 So yeah, that nigga know what I'm bout (bout)
 I'm bout my hood
 I'm bout my block
 I'm bout my chips
 So if the rap money stop and I punch ya clock
 Catch you slippin at a light (get out yo ***)
 We jack niggaz, out of towners, and rap niggaz
 And ball players cause we ball playa
 We chop it up with them trap niggaz
 We Outkasts, we Big Boi's, Ludacris with them big toys
 Where I'm from, it's only two things
 Standin on the corner, me and that liquor store
 Look what the Bloods did to Weezy
 Look what the Crips did to Jeezy
 This gangbangin *** ain't nothin to play with
 Me and Snoop Dogg just made it look easy

 [Chorus:]
 Raised in the city of angels
 Where it's safe and dangerous
 Switch lanes so stranger drive slow (drive slow)
 Where bangers and gangstas,
 Fast women and dank are just part of a face that we show
 We got mountains and ocean, we move in slow motion
 Off that sticky you walk up to go,
 I swear, ain't nothin better there
 That's why we all take our hats off to you
 The one more

 [Outro:]
 Ya'll niggaz got this L. A. *** real ***ed up man
 Niggaz better start respectin what the *** we about man
 We take niggaz the *** out
 This *** ain't no movie dawg
 This *** is real
 Crips, Bloods, Ese's
 We hold *** down
 This L. A.
 I wrote this *** on my face
 Put a mutha***in star behind it
 What the *** I am, Starface
 L. A. Chronicles, L. A. X. Files
