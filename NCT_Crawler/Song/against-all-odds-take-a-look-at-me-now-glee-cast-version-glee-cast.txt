                        How can I just let you walk away?
Just let you leave without a trace
When I stand here taking every breath with you, ooh
You're the only one who really knew me at all

How can you just walk away from me
When all I can do is watch you leave
'Cause we've shared the laughter and the pain
And even shared the tears
You're the only one who really knew me at all

So take a look at me now, 'cause has just an empty space
And there's nothing left here to remind me
just the memory of your face
Just take a look at me now, who has just an empty space
And you coming back to me is against the odds
And that's why I've gotta take

I wish I could just make you turn around
Turn around to see me cry
There's so much I need to say to you
So many reasons why
You're the only one, who really knew me at all

So take a look at me now, 'cause has just an empty space
And there's nothing left here to remind me
Just the memory of your face
Just take a look at me now
'Cause there's just an empty space

But to wait for you, is all I can do
And that's what I've gotta face
Take a good look at me now, 'cause I'll still be standing here
And you coming back to me is against all odds
And that's what I've got to take

Take a look at me now
Take a look at me now
                        
                    |
