                        You packed your things in the coverd bag 
Left and never looking back 
Rings on your fingers paint on your toes 
Music wherever you go you don't fit in a small town world 
But I feel you are the girl for me 
Rings on your fingers paint on your toes you're leaving town where nobody knows you can win if you want if you want it you will win on the way you will see 
But life is more than fantasy 
Take my hand follow me 
Oh you've got a brand new friend for your life you can win if you want if you want it you will win 
Come on take a chance 
For a brand new wild romance take my hand for the night 
And you feel it will be right 
Hold me tight 
Ah ah ah ah 

Oh darkness finds you're on your own 
And your sighs keep on rolling on you are miles and miles from your home 
But you never want to phone yor home 
Steady job and the nice young man 
Your parents had your future plan 
Rings on your fingers paint on your toes that's the way your story goes you can win if you want if you want it you will win on your way you will see 
But life is more than fantasy take my hand follow me 
Oh you've got a brand new friend for your life 
You can win if you want if you want it you will win 
Come on take my hand 
For a branch new wild romance 
Take my hand for the night and you feel it will be right 
Hold me tight

On your way you will see 
But life is more than fantasy take my hand follow me 
Oh you've got a brand new firend for your life you can win if you want if you want it you will win 
Come on take my hand 
For a branch new wild romance 
Take my hand for the night and you feel it will be right
