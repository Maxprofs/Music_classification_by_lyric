                        Bài hát: The Lonely Hour (Acoustic Version) - Sam Smith

I need someone that I'll look to 
In the lonely hour
That we all go through 
To give me comfort 
And love me through 
In the lonely hour
I need you
I need you 
I need you

I don't need diamonds
I don't need jewels 
No amount of riches will cover up these blues 
I don't need suggestions on how to start anew 
In the lonely hour I need you 
There's nothing I can do
I'm hopeless without you

It's a lonesome point of view 
And there's a wistful silence in an empty room 
These other voices they don't cut through 
In the lonely hour I need you
I need you 
And I need you 
I need someone that I'll look to
In the lonely hour I need you
I need you
                        
                    |
