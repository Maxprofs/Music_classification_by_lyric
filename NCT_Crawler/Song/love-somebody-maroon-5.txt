                        Bài hát: Love Somebody - Maroon 5 

I know your insides are feeling so hollow 
And its a hard pill for you to swallow 
(Refrain) 
Yeah, but if I fall for you 
I'll never recover 
But If I fall for you 
I'll never be the same 
(chorus) 
I really wanna love somebody 
I really wanna dance the night away 
I know we're only half way there, but you take me all the way 
You take me all the way 
I really wanna touch somebody 
I think about you every single day 
I know we're only half way there, but you can take me all the way 
You can take me all the way 

You're such a hard act for me to follow 
Love me today, don't leave me tomorrow 
Yeah but if I fall for you 
I'll never recover 
If I fall for you 
I'll never be the same 
I really wanna love somebody 
I really wanna dance the night away 
I know we're only half way there, but you take me all the way 
You take me all the way 
I really wanna touch somebody 
I think about you every single day 
I know we're only half way there, but you take me all the way 
You take me all the way 
Whoa whoa whoa oh oh oh 
Whoa whoa whoa oh oh oh 
(Bridge) 
I don't know where to start 
I'm just a little lost 
I want to feel like we're never gonna ever stop 
I don't know what to do, I'm right in front of you 
Asking you to stay, won't ya stay, stay with me tonight yeah 

I really wanna love somebody 
I really wanna dance the night away 
I know we're only half way there, but you take me all the way 
You take me all the way 
I really wanna touch somebody 
I think about you every single day 
I know we're only half way there, but you take me all the way 
You take me all the way 
Whoa Whoa whoa oh oh oh 
Whoa whoa 
Take me all the way 
(whoa oh oh oh) 
You, take me all the way (yeah)
