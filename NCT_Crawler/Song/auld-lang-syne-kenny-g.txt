                        Should old acquaintance be forgot 
and never brought to mind? 
Should old acquaintance be forgot 
and old lang syne 
for auld lang syne my dear 
for auld lang syne 
we'll take a cup of kindness yet 
for auld lang syne 
We two have run about the slopes 
and picked the daisies fine 
We'll take a cup of kindness yet 
for auld lang syne 
for auld lang syne my dear 
for auld lang syne 
We'll take a cup of kindness yet 
for auld lang syne 
Should old acquaintance be forgot 
and never brought to mind 
Should old acquaintance be forgot 
and old lang syne 
for auld lang syne my dear 
for auld lang syne.
