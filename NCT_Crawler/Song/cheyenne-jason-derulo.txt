                        Bài hát: Cheyenne - Jason Derulo

I’m a little unsure how we dress so complicated
If I let go I know I’ll regret it
Every heart that I held before I was sure to break it
I don’t know what you did but I just can’t stop
Thinking about you every day
No I can’t stop now

Look what we started darling
You’re not what I expected
Cause all I ever wanted was some fun
Look what we started darling
I used to look for exits
Cause all I ever wanted was some fun
I never meant to fall in love
I never meant to fall in love
I never meant to fall in love
I never meant to fall in love

(cheyenne)
Got the table set for two
You’re secure to make it
But I guess your lips again, I was dreaming
I stayed real late at night
The chair was so deteriorating
I’m tryna clear my head but I just can’t stop
Thinking about you every day
No I can’t stop now

Look what we started darling
You’re not what I expected
Cause all I ever wanted was some fun
Look what we started darling
I used to look for exits
Cause all I ever wanted was some fun
I never meant to fall in love
I never meant to fall in love
I never meant to fall in love
I never meant to fall in love

Cheyenne
Cheyenne
Cheyenne
Cheyenne

No I can’t stop
Thinking about you every day
No I can’t stop now

Look what we started darling
You’re not what I expected
Cause all I ever wanted was some fun
Look what we started darling
I used to look for exits
Cause all I ever wanted was some fun
I never meant to fall in love
(cheyenne)
I never meant to fall in love
(cheyenne)
I never meant to fall in love
(cheyenne)
I never meant to fall in love
(cheyenne)
