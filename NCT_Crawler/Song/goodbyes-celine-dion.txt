                        Mamma you gave life to me
Turned a baby into a lady
And mamma all you had to offer
Was a promise of a lifetime of love
Now I know there is no other love like a mother's
Love for her child
I know that love so complete someday must leave
Must say goodbye

Goodbye's the saddest word I'll ever hear
Goodbye's the last time I will hold you near
Someday you'll say that word and I will cry
It'll break my heart to hear you say goodbye
Mamma you gave love to me
Turned a young one into a woman
And mamma all I ever needed
Was a guarantee of you loving me
'Cause I know there is no other love like a mother's
Love for her child
And it hurts so that something so strong
someday'll be gone
Must say goodbye

But the love you give will always live
You'll always be there every time I fall
You are to me the greatest love at all
You take my weakness and you make me strong
And I will always love you till forever comes

And when you need me
I'll be there for you always
I'll be there your whole life through
I'll be there this I promise you mamma
I'll be your beacon through the darkest night
I'll be the wings that guide your broken flight
I'll be your shelter through the raging storm
And I will love you till forever comes

Goodbye's the saddest word I'll ever hear
Goodbye's the last time I will hold you near
Someday you'll say that word and I will cry
It'll break my heart to hear you say goodbye
Till we meet again until then goodbye.
