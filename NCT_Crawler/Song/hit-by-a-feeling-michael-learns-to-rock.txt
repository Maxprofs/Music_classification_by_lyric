                        I've been looking for an angle 
For a shortcut to your mind 
There's no point for us to wrangle 
So baby here's the bottom line (Here it goes) 
I know you never left me when you ran away 
'Cause I can tell you missed me more than you will say 
[Chorus] 
Suddenly the sky turns blue I'm hit by a feeling 
Whenever I am close to you my troubles fade away 
Suddenly the wind gets warm I'm finally breathing (tonight) 
That is how I know where I belong - you will always be the one 
If you're ever feeling lonely 
And you ever change your mind 
You know I never blamed you for being brave 
When I was way too scared to face the mess we'd made 
[Chorus] 
Suddenly the sky turns blue I'm hit by a feeling 
Whenever I am close to you my troubles fade away 
Whereever I go and whatever I do 
I'm always reaching out for you 
That is how I know where I belong - you will always be the one 
I am still reminded how we sat in silence 
And you smiled at me and said 
There's no need for us to cry 'cause this is not goodbye 
[Chorus] 
Suddenly the sky turns blue I'm hit by a feeling 
Whenever I am close to you my troubles fade away 
Whereever I go and whatever I do 
I'm always reaching out for you 
That is how I know where I belong - you will always be the one
