Blue - Get Down

Yo
C'mon C'mon

That's right

C'mon C'mon

Check this out

I'm not the kind of guy you can take for granted
But if you treat me right
I'll give you what you wanted
It's not the way I am to tell you what I'm feeling
But if you really care
You'll know what I'm meaning.
Think again, before you get the wrong impression on your mind,
Think again, don't walk away, I'm not fooling (I'm not fooling).
If you wanna get down with me,
Let the love come naturally,
We can get back what we had you cannot deny it.
Say you wanna get down with me,
Close your eyes and you will see,
It can be just like before you just got to try it.

Yeah that's right

C'mon check it out.

You're heard it all before
But this time I can change girl,
I'll show you so much more
Love you've never seen now
I got so much to give I want a chance to prove it
Reach out and take my hand.
I never want to lose it
[man speak]
