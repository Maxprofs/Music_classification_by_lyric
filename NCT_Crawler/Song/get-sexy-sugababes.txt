                        Bài hát: Get Sexy - Sugababes

When I'm walkin' down the street they say , "Hey, sexy"
(Hey, sexy)
When I'm dancin' in the club they say, "Hey, sexy"
(Hey, sexy)
When I'm drivin' in my car, or I'm standing at the bar
It don't matter where I are, they say, "Hey sexy"
(Hey, sexy)

Silly boys, they lovin' me so much
Silly boys, you can look but you can't touch
Silly boys, I ain't got no time to talk
Silly boys, just shut up and watch me walk

'Cause I'm too sexy in this club
Too sexy in this club
So sexy it hurts
If you feel sexy in this club
Then go 'head toast it up
Take it down, let's get sexy right now

Now
Yeah, sexy right now
Y-y-yeah, sexy right now
Y-y-yeah, sexy right now
When I'm shopping with my girls they say, "Hey, sexy"
(Hey, sexy)
In a two-piece at the beach they say, "Hey, sexy"
(Hey, sexy)
When they put me on they arms, so they maximize the charm
Cause I'm shinin' like a star, yeah, I'm so sexy
(Hey, sexy)

Silly boys, they lovin' me so much
Silly boys, you can look but you can't touch
Silly boys, I ain't got no time to talk
Silly boys, just shut up and watch me walk

'Cause I'm too sexy in this club
Too sexy in this club
So sexy it hurts
If you feel sexy in this club
Then go 'head toast it up
Take it down, lets get sexy right now

Now
