                        Bài hát: Sadderdaze - The Neighbourhood

[Verse 1]
Dirty fingernails, same as your mind
But he could strum the guitar just fine
Every now and then he'd think about his life
Daydreamin' just to pass the time

[Pre-Chorus]
Now the sun is closer than it was before
Anyone who's anyone can feel it

[Chorus]
Saturdays are not the same as they used to be
Sadder days, why do they keep on using me?
They keep on using me

[Verse 2]
Even as a child everyone would say
He was gonna be a star someday
Finally he found a way to reach the sky
But he didn't know what he'd find

[Pre-Chorus]
Now the sun is closer than it was before
Anyone who's anyone can feel it, mmm

[Chorus]
Saturdays are not the same as they used to be
Sadder days, why do they keep on using me?
They keep on using me

[Bridge]
He's got a big head full of trash
And he talks down every chance he gets
He's a grown man with committable mistakes

[Outro]
Saturdays are not the same as they used to be
Sadder days, why do they keep on using me?
Saturdays are not the same as they used to be
Sadder days, why do they keep on using me?
Saturdays are not the same as they used to be
Sadder days, why do they keep on using me?
They keep on using me
They keep on using me
They keep on using me
They keep on using me
They keep on using me
                        
                    |
