                        Bài hát : Reflection (Mulan) - V.A

Look at me
I will never pass fora perfect bride or a perfect daughter
Can it be
I'm not meant to play this part
Now I see that if I were truly to be myself
I would break my family's heart
Who is that girl I see
Staring straight back at me
Why is my reflection someone
I don't know
Somehow I cannot hide who I am
though I've tried
When will my reflection show
Who I am inside
When will my reflection show
Who I am inside
                        
                    |
