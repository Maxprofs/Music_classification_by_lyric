Touch My Body
Mariah Carey

I know that you been waiting for it, I'm waiting too
In my imagination I be all up on you
I know you got that fever for me, 102
And boy I know I feel the same my temperature's through the roof

If there's a camera up in here, then it's gon' leave with me when I do
If there's a camera up in here, then I best not catch this flick on Youtube.
Cause if you run your mouth and brag about this secret rendezvous
I will hunt you down
Cause baby I'm up in my business like a Wendy interview
But this is private, 'tween you and I

Touch my body, put me on the floor, hustle me around, play with me some more
Touch my body, throw me on the bed, I just wanna make you feel like you never did
Touch my body, let me rub your thighs, all around your waist, just a little taste
Touch my body, know you love my curves, come on and give me what I deserve
And touch my body

Boy you can book me on you like a brand new ID
I'll hug your body tighter than my favorite jeans
I want you to caress me like a tropical breeze
And float away with you in my Caribbean Scene

If there's a camera up in here, then it's gon' leave with me when I do
If there's a camera up in here, then I best not catch this flick on Youtube.
Cause if you run your mouth and brag about this secret rendezvous
I will hunt you down
Cause baby I'm up in my business like a Wendy interview
But this is private, 'tween you and I

Touch my body, put me on the floor, hustle me around, play with me some more
Touch my body, throw me on the bed, I just wanna make you feel like you never did
Touch my body, let me rub your thighs, all around your waist, just a little taste
Touch my body, know you love my curves, come on and give me what I deserve
And touch my body

I'mma treat you like a teddy bear
You won't wanna go nowhere
In the lap of luxury
Baby just turn to me
You won't want for nothing boy
I will give you plenty
Touch my body, put me on the floor, hustle me around, play with me some more
Touch my body, throw me on the bed, I just wanna make you feel like you never did
Touch my body, let me rub your thighs, all around your waist, just a little taste
Touch my body, know you love my curves, come on and give me what I deserve
And touch my body

Touch my body
Touch my body
Touch my body
Touch my body
