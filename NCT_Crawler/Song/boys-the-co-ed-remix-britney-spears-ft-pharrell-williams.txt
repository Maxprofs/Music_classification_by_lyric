                        Song: Boys (The Co-Ed Remix) - Britney Spears, Pharrell Williams

For whatever reason
I feel like I've been wanting you all my life
You don't understand
I'm so glad we're at the same place at the same time, it's over now

I spotted you dancin'
You made all the girls stare
Those lips and your brown eyes
And the sexy hair

I shake shake my thang
I make the world want you
Tell your boys you'll be back
I wanna see what you can do

What would it take for you to
Just leave with me?
Not tryin' to sound conceited
But you and me were meant to be

You're a sexy guy
I'm a nice girl
Let's turn this dance floor
Into our own little nasty world

Boys, sometimes a girl just needs one
Boys to love her and to hold
Boys and when a girl is with one
Boys then she's in control

Yo, pull your girl off the dance floor
Whisper in her ear
Must've said somethin' 'bout me
'Cuz now she's lookin over here

You lookin' at me
With that sexy attitude
But the way your girls movin' it
It puts me in the mood

What would it take
For you to just leave with me?
Not tryin' to sound conceited
But me you was destiny

I'm from N.E.R.D.
Aren't you Britney?
Let's turn this dance floor
Into our own little nasty thing

Girls, I can't speak for no one
Girls, but I need them all the time
Girls, I don't know 'bout your girl
Girls, but I know she's on your mind

Boys, sometimes a girl just needs one
Boys, to love her and to hold
Boys, and when a girl is with one
Boys, then she's in control

Here we go
Have no fear
Baby what are you waiting for?
Let me see what you can do

Boys, sometimes a girl just needs one
Boys, to love her and to hold
Boys, and when a girl is with one
Boys, then she's in control

Girls, I can't speak for no one
Girls, but I need them all the time
Girls, I don't know 'bout your girl
Girls, but I know she's on your mind

Boys, girls
Boys, girls
Boys, girls
Boys, girls

Get nasty!
