                        Say you will,say you will be mine
I just keep missing you tonight
I feel so unsure,I feel so alone
I just don't dare to open my eyes

Into deep,going in too deep
I can't get you out of my mind
Baby no matter just how hard I try
I don't want to be alone tonight

Won't you be my guilding light
Lead the way to be by your side
Won't you be my star tonight
I need more than a neon light

Say you will,say you will be mine
I just keep missing you tonight
I feel so unsure,I feel so alone
I just don't dare to open my eyes
                        
                    |
