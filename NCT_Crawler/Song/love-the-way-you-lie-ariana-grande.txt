                        On the first page of the story
The future seemed so bright
Then this thing turned out so evil
I dont know why I'm still surprised
Even angels have their wicked schemes
And you take that to new extremes
But you'll always be my hero
Even though you've lost your mind


Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
But thats all right because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
But thats all right because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
Ohh, I love the way you lie


Now there's gravel in our voices
Glass is shattered from the fight
In this tug of war, you'll always win
Even when I'm right
Cause you feed me fables from your head
With violent words and empty threats
And it's sick that all these battles
Are what keeps me satisfied


Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
But thats all right because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
But thats all right because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
Ohh, I love the way you lie

So maybe I'm a masochist
I try ro run but I don't wanna ever leave
Til these walls are goin' up
In smoke with all our memories


Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
But thats all right because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
But thats all right because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
Ohh, I love the way you lie

Hope there aren't any mistakes!
