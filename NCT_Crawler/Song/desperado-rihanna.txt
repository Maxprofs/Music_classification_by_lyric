                        Bài hát: Desperado - Rihanna

[Verse 1]
Desperado
Sitting in an old Monte Carlo
A man whose heart is hollow
Uh huh, take it easy
I’m not tryna go against you
Actually I’m going richer

[Pre-Chorus]
Gotta get up out of here
And you ain’t leaving me behind
I know you won't cause we share common interests too
Need me there ain’t no leaving me behind
Never know, no, just want out of here
Yeah, yes, once I’m gone ain’t no going back

[Chorus]
If you want, take a peek and run away
Running from and it’s out of luck
Yeah, yeah, there ain’t nothing
There ain’t nothing here for me
There ain’t nothing here for me anymore
But I don’t wanna be alone

[Verse 2]
Desperado
Sitting in an old Monte Carlo
We've both had our hearts broken
Take it easy
I'm not trying to go against you
I can be a lone wolf fishing

[Pre-Chorus]
Gotta get up out of here
And you ain’t leaving me behind
I know you won't cause we share common interests too
Need me there ain’t no leaving me behind
Never know, no, both flying up out of here
Yeah, yes, once I’m gone ain’t no going back

[Chorus]
If you want, we could be runaways
Running from and it’s out of luck
Yeah, yeah, there ain’t nothing
There ain’t nothing here for me
There ain’t nothing here for me anymore
I don’t wanna be alone

[Bridge]
Dear desperado
Yeah I don’t wanna be alone
Dear desperado
Yeah I don’t wanna be alone

[Chorus]
If you want, we could be runaways
Running from and it’s out of luck
Yeah, yeah, there ain’t nothing
There ain’t nothing here for me
There ain’t nothing here for me anymore
But I don’t wanna be alone

[Outro]
Yeah-yeah-ah
Yeah-yeah-ah
Yeah-yeah-ah
Yeah-yeah-ah
Yeah-yeah-ah
Yeah-yeah-ah
