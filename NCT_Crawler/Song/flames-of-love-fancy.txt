                        Bài hát: Flames of love - Fancy

What kind of man,
what kind of man am I?
I try to walk where I just fell,
I try to break a secret spell,
in your eyes I feel the flames of love

Flames of Love (2x)

CHORUS:
I'm drowning in the sea of love,and enough is never enough,
when I find myself, deep in your eyes,
over and over again,
Flames of Love

What kind of fool,
what kind of fool am I?
I look for shadows in the sun,
and memories of days to come
in your eyes I feel the flames of love

Flames of Love (2x)

CHORUS

I surender to sleep dead in your arms,
in a wave of lust for live,
you touch me so deep,
I cry out,
mountain in a flames of love

Flames of love (2)
                        
                    |
