                        Bài hát: Lover On The Line - Bad Boys Blue

One day I'll see I let you go away.
One day I'll think that everything is okay.
One day I'll feel that it won't hurt no more.
One day I'll know that I have lost you.

I'll be your lover on the line.
And if I suffer - never mind.
La de da lover on the line.
We got to heaven number nine.
I'll be your lover on the line.
La de da lover on the line.
I'll be your lover on the line.

One day I'll look into your cold, blue eyes.
One day I'll try to get away from your lies.
One day I saw you didn't care at all.
One day I knew that I have lost you.

I'll be your lover on the line.
And if I suffer - never mind.
La de da lover on the line.
We got to heaven number nine.
I'll be your lover on the line.
La de da lover on the line.
I'll be your lover on the line.

One day I'll do the things I wanna do.
One day I know, won't even think about you.
One day I'll feel that I am free again.
One day I'll know that I have lost you.

I'll be your lover.
I'll be your hunter.
I'll be your lover.
I'll be your lover.

I'll be your lover on the line.
I'll be your lover on the line.
And if I suffer - never mind.
La de da lover on the line.
We got to heaven number nine.
I'll be your lover on the line.
La de da lover on the line.
I'll be your lover on the line.
