You call to me, and I fall at your feet
How could anyone ask for more?
And our time apart, like knives in my heart
How could anyone ask for more?
But if theres a pill to help me forget
God knows I haven't found it yet
But I'm dying to
God, I'm trying to

Just trying not to love you, only goes so far
Trying not to need you is tearing me apart
Can't see the silver lining from down here on the floor
And I just keep on trying, but I don't know what for
'Cause trying not to love you 
Only Makes me love you more (2x's)

And this kind of pain, only time takes away
That's why it's harder to let you go
And nothing I can do, without thinking of you
That's why it's harder to let you go
But if there's a pill to help me forget
God knows I haven't found it yet
But I'm dying to
God, I'm trying to

Just trying not to love you, only goes so far
Trying not to need you is tearing me apart
Can't see the silver lining from down here on the floor
And I just keep trying, but I dont know what for
'Cause trying not to love you
Only makes me love you more

So I sit here divided just talking to myself
Was it something that I did? 
Was there somebody else?
When a voice from behind me, that was fighting back tears
Sat right down beside me, whispered right in my ear
Tonight, I'm dying to tell you

That trying not to love you only went so far
And trying not to need you was tearing me apart
Now I see the silver lining of what we're fighting for
If we just keep on trying we could be much more
'Cause trying not to love you
Oh, yeah trying not to love you
Only makes me love you more (2x's)
