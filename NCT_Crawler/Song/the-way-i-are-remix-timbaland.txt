                        Baby if you strip, you can get a tip 
'Cause I like you just the way you are 
I'm about to strip and I'm well equipped 
Can you handle me the way I'm are? 

I don't need the G's or the car keys 
Boy I like you just the way you are 
Let me see ya strip, you can get a tip 
'Cause I like, I like, I like... 

Oh 
Baby, it's alright now 
You ain't gotta flaunt for me 
If we go touch 
You can still touch my love, it's free 
We can work without the perks just you and me 
Thug it out til' we get it right 

I ain't got no money 
I ain't got no car to take you on a date 
I can't even buy you flowers 
But together we could be the perfect soulmates 
Talk to me girl 

Oh 
Baby, it's alright now 
You ain't gotta flaunt for me 
If we go touch 
You can still touch my love, it's free 
We can work without the perks just you and me 
Thug it out til' we get it right 

Oh 
Baby, it's alright now 
You ain't gotta flaunt for me 
If we go touch 
You can still touch my love, it's free 
We can work without the perks just you and me 
Thug it out til' we get it right
