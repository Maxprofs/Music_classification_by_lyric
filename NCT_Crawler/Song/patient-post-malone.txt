                        Bài hát: Patient - Post Malone

[Intro]
Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Hook]
I know my wrist be dancin' crazy
Been on some fly *** lately
Used to be so damn patient
But now it's "*** you, pay me"
Can't let these motherfuckers phase me
Never let that money change me
Ain't the way my momma raised me
Don't mean to brag but can you blame me?

[Verse 1]
Two hundred K and VVS, yellow diamonds
They wanna run up but they won't never find me
Sleep right next to the F&N
Motherfuckers the government
Shut down all the plotting
One hundred bands on my body
*** with them boys, touch your body
Lil' momma just want my pockets
'Rari take off like a rocket
Hold up, you too close
I don't know, I don't know ya
Had to run it, run it up
How I roll, how I roll, yeah
It's like after you pop off
They all act like they know ya
And Young Post be like Pablo
And they all love to blow, yeah

[Hook]
I know my wrist be dancin' crazy
Been on some fly *** lately
Used to be so damn patient
But now it's "*** you, pay me"
Can't let these motherfuckers phase me
Never let that money change me
Ain't the way my momma raised me
Don't mean to brag, but can you blame me?

[Verse 2]
Two hundred, swerving, dippin', dodge on the highway
You may contain me but you won't never stop me
On her way to my residence
Try message your boo again
She pullin' up prolly
Strally inside of that Bentley
Yeah, come take a tat' on my belly
Yeah, people actin' too friendly, man
They tryna get dividends
This *** is a problem
Yeah, you just be talkin' *** but ain't ever met me
DeChino *** your bitch and now you resent me
I know them people but they don't represent me
Them wastemen, we gonna make 'em all pay
They will never stop the plan
Eighty jumpin' off my hand
Rollie, rollie, rollie
Bust it open, holy moly

[Hook]
I know my wrist be dancin' crazy
Been on some fly *** lately
Used to be so damn patient
But now it's "*** you, pay me"
Can't let these motherfuckers phase me
Never let that money change me
Ain't the way my momma raised me
Don't mean to brag but can you blame me?

[Outro]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, woah
Oh, oh, oh, oh, woah
Oh, oh, oh, oh, woah
Oh, oh, oh, oh, woah
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
