                        Face down with the L.A. curbside endings
 In ones and zeros
 Downtown was the perfect place to hide The first star that I saw last night
 Was a headlight of a man-made sky
 But man-made never made our dreams collide, collide Here we are now with the falling sky and the rain
 We're awakening
 Here we are now with the desperate youth and pain
 We're awakening Maybe it's called ambition
 You've been talking in your sleep about a dream
 We're awakening Last week saw me living for nothing but deadlines
 With my dead beat sky
 But this town doesn't look the same tonight These dreams started singing to me out of nowhere
 And all my life I don't know
 That I've ever felt so alive, alive Here we are now with the falling sky and the rain
 We're awakening
 Here we are now with the desperate youth and pain
 We're awakening Maybe it's called ambition
 You've been talking in your sleep about a dream
 We're awakening I wanna wake up kicking and screaming
 I wanna wake up kicking and screaming
 I wanna know that my heart's still beating
 It's beating, I'm bleeding I wanna wake up kicking and screaming
 I wanna live like I know what I'm leaving
 I wanna know that my heart's still beating
 It's beating, it's beating, it's beating, I'm bleeding Here we are now with the falling sky and the rain
 We're awakening
 Here we are now with the desperate youth and pain
 We're awakening Maybe it's called ambition
 But you've been talk, talking in your sleep about a dream
 We're awakening
 Dream, we're awakening
