                        Bài hát: Gotta Boyfriend (Acoustic) - Frankmusik

Boyfriend
B b boyfriend
Boyfriend boyfriend
Boyfriend

So you gotta gotta boy right here
Have you got a boyfriend out there
Cos I know we could maybe, we could share
But I don't think that's very, very fair

It's so more hard when I'm not right here with you
You make me do things, I don't want to do
You call me in and I know there's so much more
Why do you pick me up to kick me to the floor

So you got a boyfriend right here
Have you got a boyfriend out there
Cos I know maybe we could maybe, we could share
But I don't think that's very, very fair

I go to clubs
You go to clubs to
But my friends tell me that I don't have a clue
So you can give me one the next time I'm out
So I got something to scream and shout like

So you got a boyfriend right here
Have you got a boyfriend out there
I know maybe we could, we couldshare
But I don't think that's very, very fair

So you got a boyfriend right here
Have you got a boyfriend out there
I know maybe we could, we could share
But I don't think that's very, very fair
We could share, aiirrr, aiirrr

Now I wonder, why this way
I don't know where you really strayed
and your empty touch
Fractures all of my skin
How happy I could be with the one without you in

So you got a boyfriend right here
Have you got a boyfriend out there
I know maybe we could, we could share
But I don't think that's very, very fair

Gotta boyfriend right here
Have you got a boyfriend out there
So you got a boyfriend right here
Have you got a boyfriend out there
