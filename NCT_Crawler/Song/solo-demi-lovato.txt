                        You sing to me
and in your words i hear the melody
but in the twilight it's so hard to see
what's wrong for me

i cant resist
until you give the truth a little twist
as if you're ganna get away with this
you're not sorry

i can't believe i fell for this
i fell through the hole
down at the bottom of your soul
didn't think you would go solo

look at what you've done
you're listening to what you want?
got me ready to go solo
solo

you sang to me
too bad you couldn't even sing it on key
if real life is such a mystery
why didn't you just stick to acting
oh

here we go again
you couldn't find my number until when
you thought that you could get to my best friend
without a script your ganna lose the game

i can't believe i fell for this
i fell through the hole
down at the bottom of your soul
didn't think you would go solo

look at what you've done
you're listening to what you want?
got me ready to go solo

id rather go out to a party alone 
than have to walk around with you on my arm
cause now i have to admit your done
good luck trying to fight back

i didn't think you would go solo
look at what you've done
you're listening to what you want?
got me ready to go solo
solo oh
you've got me ready to go solo
solo
