                        Bài hát: It Ain't Me - Kygo, Selena Gomez

[Verse 1: Selena Gomez] 
I had a dream 
We were sipping whisky neat 
Highest floor, the bowery 
And I was high enough 
'Somewhere along the lines 
We stopped seeing eye to eye 
You were staying out all night 
And I had enough 

[Pre-Chorus 1: Selena Gomez] 
No, I don't wanna know where you been or where you're going 
But I know I won't be home 
And you'll be on your own 

[Chorus: Selena Gomez] 
Who's gonna walk you through the dark side of the morning? 
Who's gonna rock you when the sun won't let you sleep? 
Who's waking up to drive you home when you're drunk and all alone? 
Who's gonna walk you through the dark side of the morning? 
It ain't me 

[Drop: Selena Gomez + Kygo] 
It ain't me 
It ain't me 
It ain't me 

[Verse 2: Selena Gomez] 
I had a dream 
We were back to seventeen 
Summer nights and the liberties 
Never growing up 
I'll take with me the polaroids and the memories 
But you know I'm gonna leave behind the worst of us 

[Chorus: Selena Gomez] 
Who's gonna walk you through the dark side of the morning? 
Who's gonna rock you when the sun won't let you sleep? 
Who's waking up to drive you home when you're drunk and all alone? 
Who's gonna walk you through the dark side of the morning? 
It ain't me 

[Post-Chorus: Selena Gomez + Kygo] 
It ain't me, no no 
It ain't me, no no 
It ain't me, no no 
Who's gonna walk you through the dark side of the morning? 
It ain't me 

[Drop: Selena Gomez + Kygo] 
It ain't me 
It ain't me
                        
                    |
