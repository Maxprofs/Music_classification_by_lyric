                        Bài hát : Ah Yeah - August Alsina

[Verse 1]
Where did you come from?
Am I the only that you make feel this way?
Where did you learn from [?] can be taught these days
You shine with picture perfect beauty, show it off
Show it show it off, let 'em see you show it off
Tell me how you doing it to me, showing off
Let 'em see you show it off, with the whole world going off

[Hook]
I don't think you know you're that fine
Making 'em all beg falling to their knees
You know you're blowing my mind
Make 'em all die fall to their knees

Ah yeah [x20]

[Verse 1]
Where that walk come from?
How you do it keep me so mesmerized
You may be that one
With a body like that you would start a riot

[Bridge]
You shine with picture perfect beauty, show it off
Show it show it off, let 'em see you show it off
Tell me how you doing it to me, showing off
Let 'em see you show it off, with the whole world going off

[Hook]
I don't think you know you're that fine
Making 'em all beg falling to their knees
You know you're blowing my mind
Make 'em all die fall to their knees

Ah yeah [x20]
