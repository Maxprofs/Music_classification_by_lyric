                        There are times
When you make me laugh
There are moments when you drive me mad
There are seconds when
I see the light
Though many times you made me cry

There's something
You don't understand
I want to be your man

[Chorus ]
Nothing to lose
Your love to win
Hoping so bad
That you'll love me in
I'm at your feet
Waiting for you
I've got time
And nothing to lose

There are times
When I believe in you
These moments when I feel close to you
There are times I think
That I am yours
Though many times I feel unsure

There's something
You don't understand
I want to be your man

Nothing to lose
Your love to win
Hoping so bad
That you'll let me in
I'm on your feet
Waiting for you
I've got time
And nothing to lose

I'll always be around you
Keep an eye on you
And I won't let you run
'Cause you are the only one

Nothing to lose
Your love to win
Hoping so bad
That you'll let me in
I'm at your feet
Waiting for you
I've got time
An nothing to lose
                        
                    |
