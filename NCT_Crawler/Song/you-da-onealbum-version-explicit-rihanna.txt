                        [Intro:]
 You the one that I dream about all da-a-ay
 You the one that I think about alwa-a-ays
 You Are The One So I Make Sure I Beha-a-ave!
 My love is your love, your love is my love-(ove-ove)

 [Verse:]
 Baby, I love you, I need you here
 With me all the time
 Baby we meant to be
 You got me, smiling all the time

 [Hook:]
 Cause you know how to give me that
 You know how to pull me back
 When I go runnin, runnin
 Tryin' to get away from loving ya
 You know how to love me hard
 I won't lie, I'm falling hard
 Yep, I'm falling for ya but there's nothin wrong with that

 [Chorus:]
 You the one that I dream about all da-a-ay
 You the one that I think about alwa-a-ays
 You Are The One So I Make Sure I Beha-a-ave!
 My love is your love, your love is my love-(ove-ove)

 You the one that I dream about all day
 You the one that I think about always
 You Are The One So I Make Sure I Behave!
 My love is your love, your love is mine

 [Verse 2:]
 Baby come, tear me now, hold me now
 Make me come alive
 You got the sweetest touch
 I'm so happy, you came in my life

 Hook

 Chorus

 [Bridge:]
 And Yes I'm kinda crazy,
 That's what happens baby,
 When you put it down
 You should've give it to me
 Good like that,
 Should've hit it like that,
 Had me yellin' like that
 Didn't know you would've had me coming back
 You the one that I'm feeling
 You the one that I'm loving
 Ain't no other, that's like you
 No there's just one, one, one
 No baby just one, one
 I bet you wanna know

 Chorus
