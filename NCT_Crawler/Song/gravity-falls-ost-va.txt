                        Bài hát: Gravity Falls (OST) - V.A

Don't be scared
We were born prepared
For this journey
Full of mystery
Time to explore this wonder
Reach answers that we hunger
Discover the truths hidden
We can't run
Trust no one
Take my hand and we'll see all
The secrets of Gravity Falls
                        
                    |
