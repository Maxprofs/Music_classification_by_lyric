Oshiete oshiete yo sono shikumi wo

Boku no naka ni dare ka iru no
Kowareta kowareta yo kono sekai de
Kimi ga warau nani mo miezu ni

Kowareta boku nante sa iki wo tomete
Hodokenai mou hodokenai yo shinjitsu sa e freeze
Kowaseru kowasenai kurueru kuruenai
Anata wo mitsukete

Yureta yuganda sekai ni tatta boku wa
Sukitootte mienakunatte
Mitsukenai de boku no koto wo
Mitsumenaide
Dare ka ga kaita sekai no naka de
Anata wo kizutsuketaku wa nai yo
Oboete te boku no koto wo
Azayakana mama

Mugen ni hirogaru kodoku ga karamaru
Mujaki ni waratta kioku ga sasatta
Ugokenai hodokenai ugokenai hodokenai ugokenai ugokenai yo
Unravel ghoul

Kawattashimatta kaerarenakatta
Futatsu ga karamaru futari ga horobiru
Kowaseru kowasenai kurueru kuruenai
Anata wo kegasenaiyo

Yureta yuganda sekai ni tatta boku wa
Sukitootte mienakutte
Mitsukenai de boku no koto wo
Mitsumenaide
Dare ka ga shikunda kodokuna wana ni
Mirai ga hodoketeshimau mae ni
Omoidashite boku no koto wo
Azayakana mama

Wasurenaide wasurenaide wasurenaide wasurenaide

Kawatteshimatta ni koto ni paralyze
Kaerarenai koto darake paradise
Oboetete boku no koto wo

Oshiete oshiete
Boku no naka ni dare ka iru no? 

Translation: 
Tell me, please tell me, what this plot is all about.. Exactly, who resides within me? 
I'm broken, so broken - amidst this world. Yet you laugh, blind to everything.

Being as broken as I am, I hold my breath, 
And it can't be unraveled, it can no longer be unraveled.. Not even the truth. (Freeze) 
Breakable; unbreakable - psychotic; unable to go insane 
I'll find you, and..!

In this shaken, twisted world, I gradually become transparent, unable to be seen. 
Please don't bother looking for me; don't stare at me.. 
I merely don't want to hurt you, inside a world, that came out of someone's imagination. 
So please remember me; as vivid as I was.

Infinitely spreading, solitude wraps around me. Memories of times I laughed innocently comes to mind, 
And I can't move, can't move, can't move, can't move, can't move, I cannot move! 
Unravelling the world

I've changed; I couldn't go back to the way I was. 
As the two twines around one another, the both of us will perish away.. 
Breakable; unbreakable - psychotic; unable to go insane 
I can't afford to let you be defiled!

In this shaken, twisted world, I gradually become transparent, unable to be seen. 
Please don't bother looking for me; don't stare at me.. 
In a trap of solitude someone had set, before the future unravels, 
Remember me; as vivid as I was.

Please don't forget me, don't forget me, don't forget me, don't forget me!

Paralyzed by the fact that I've changed, 
In a paradise filled with nothing but unrecoverable things, 
Please remember me.

Tell me, please tell me.. Exactly, who resides within me?
                        
                    |
