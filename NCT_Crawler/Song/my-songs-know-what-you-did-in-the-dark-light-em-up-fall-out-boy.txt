                        Bài hát: My Songs Know What You Did In The Dark (light Em Up) - Fall Out Boy

B-B-Be careful making wishes in the dark (dark,dark) 
Can't be sure when they've hit their,mark and beside in the mean meantime... 
I'm just dreaming of tearing you apart. 
I'm in the de-details with the,devil 
You know the world can't ever get me on my... 
Level I just gotta get you out the cage,on my young,lover's rage 
God,I need a spark to ignite 
My songs know what you did in the dark 
So light em up-up-up,light em up-up-up,light em up-up-up 
I'm on fire 
So light em up-up-up,light em up-up-up,light em up-up-up 
I'm on fire 
Whoa (in the dark) 
Whoa (in the dark) 
The writers keep writing what they,write somewhere another pretty vein just 
Dies I've got the scars from tomorrow 
And I wish you could see 
That you're the antidote to everything except for me 
A constellation of tears on your 
Lashes burn everything you love then burn the... 
Ashes in the end everything collides my childhood 
Spat back out the monster that you see 
My songs know what you did in the dark 
So light em up-up-up,light em up-up-up,light em up-up-up 
I'm on fire 
So light em up-up-up,and light em up-up-up,light em up-up-up 
I'm on fire 
Whoa (in the dark) 
Whoa (in the dark) 

My songs know what you did in the dark 
My songs know what you did in the dark 
So light em up-up-up.light em up-up-up,light em-up-up-up 
I'm on fire 
So light em up-up-up,and light em up-up-up,light em up-up-up 
I'm on fire 
Whoa (in the dark) 
Whoa (in the dark) 

Whoa.
