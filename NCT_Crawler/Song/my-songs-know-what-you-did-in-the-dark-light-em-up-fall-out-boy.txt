                        Bài hát : My Songs Know What You Did In The Dark (Light Em Up) - Fall Out Boy

Be careful making wishes in the dark, dark
Can’t be sure when they’ve hit their mark, mark
And besides in the meantime I’m just dreaming of tearing you apart
I'm in the details with the devil
So now the world can never get me on my level
I just got to get you out of the cage
I'm a young lover's rage
Gonna need a spark to ignite
My songs know what you did in the dark

So light em up, light em up, light em up
I’m on fire
So light em up, light em up, light em up
I’m on fire

(In the dark, dark
In the dark, dark)

All the writers keep writing what they write
Somewhere another pretty vein just dies
I’ve got the scars from tomorrow and I wish you could see
That you’re the antidote to everything except for me
A constellation of tears on your lashes
Burn everything you love
Then burn the ashes
In the end everything collides
My childhood spat back the monster that you see
My songs know what you did in the dark

So light em up, light em up, light em up
I’m on fire
So light em up, light em up, light em up
I’m on fire

(In the dark, dark
In the dark, dark)

My songs know what you did in the dark
My songs know what you did in the dark

So light em up, light em up, light em up
I’m on fire
So light em up, light em up, light em up
I’m on fire

(In the dark, dark
In the dark, dark)
