                        Shoot the runner, shoot, shoot the runner
 I'm a king and she's my queen
 Shoot the runner, shoot, shoot the runner
 I'm a king and she's my queen Dream, dream again in your way
 Always knew that you would
 Lose yourself to the scene
 Am I only a dream Shoot the runner, shoot, shoot the runner
 I'm a king and she's my queen, bitch Bang, bang away on my chain
 (My chain)
 Always know that I can
 Get your ass to the floor
 Absinthe make you a *** Shoot the runner, shoot, shoot the runner
 I'm a king and she's my queen
 Shoot the runner, shoot, shoot the runner
 I'm the king and she's my queen, bitch There's, there's no cover in here
 Having sex in the snow
 All things gone with the past
 Lose your taste like the rest And you're my queen, that's it
 Shoot shoot the runner
 'Cause I'm a king and you're my queen, bitch
