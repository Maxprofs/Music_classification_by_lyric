                        Bài hát: Like I'm Gonna Lose You - Meghan Trainor, John Legend

[Meghan Trainor]
I found myself dreaming in silver and gold
Like a scene from a movie that every broken heart knows
We were walking on moonlight, you pulled me close
Split second and you disappeared and then I was all alone
Woke up in tears with you by my side
Breath of a leave and I realized,
No one will promise tomorrow

[Chorus]
So, I'm gonna love you like I'm gonna lose you,
I'm gonna hold you like I'm saying goodbye
Forever will stay in, I won't take you for granted
'Cause we'll never know it when we'll run out of time
So, I'm gonna love you like I'm gonna lose you,
I'm gonna love you like I'm gonna lose you

[John Legend]
In a blink of an eye,
Just a whisper of smoke
You could lose everything
The truth is you're never alone
So, I'll kiss you longer baby
Any chance that I get
I'll make the most of the minutes
So long with no regret
Let's take our time to say what we want
Here's what we've got
Before it's all gone
'Cause no one will promise tomorrow

[Chorus]
So, I'm gonna love you like I'm gonna lose you,
I'm gonna hold you like I'm saying goodbye
Forever will stay in, I won't take you for granted
'Cause we'll never know it when we'll run out of time
So, I'm gonna love you like I'm gonna lose you,
I'm gonna love you like I'm gonna lose you

[Chorus]
I'm gonna love you like I'm gonna lose you,
I'm gonna hold you like I'm saying goodbye
Forever will stay in, I won't take you for granted
'Cause we'll never know it when we'll run out of time
So, I'm gonna love you like I'm gonna lose you,
I'm gonna love you like I'm gonna lose you
