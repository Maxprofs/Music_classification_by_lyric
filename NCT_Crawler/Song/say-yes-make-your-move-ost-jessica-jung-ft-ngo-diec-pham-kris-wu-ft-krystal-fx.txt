                        Bài hát : Say Yes (Make Your Move OST) - Jessica (SNSD), Kris (EXO-M), Krystal (f(x))

I’m not your ordinary chick with the radio song.
I’m not saying I ain’t cute, but don’t get me wrong.
I’m making bomb, makes them dance when they put it on
All the way to the back of the club, whut

Don’t be confused when you see me
I don’t wanna be compared to nobody
If you want your style, I can lace you up
Crank it up a little high. Do you feel that?

Bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb
Make the speakers pop
Bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb (Ooh~ Ooh~)
Make the speakers pop

[Jes/Kry] If you are feeling the vibes on these drops
[Jes/Kry] All you gotta do is just say yes
[Jes/Kry] If you are feeling like it is getting to hot
[Jes/Kry] All you gotta do is just say yes.

[Jes/Kry] Can you feel it in the club and we’re on our way tonight
[Jes/Kry] Let me hear you say yes
[Jes/Kry] It’s crazy in here, won’t stop
[Jes/Kry] So just say yes

I’m not one of those who just wait and go
You see I’m trying to be around for a while, you know
I’m about to turn up the heat, 100 degrees
It’s gonna get hot up in here yeah

Wait! I got some things for the fellas you know
When you wanna come around and approach me slow
I’m not the girl such known to ya
If I feel you, then maybe we can do this~ Ooh Oh

Bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb
Make the speakers pop
Bomb, bomb, bomb, bomb (Hey~ Ooh Oh Oh)
Make the speakers pop

[Jes/Kry] If you are feeling the vibes on these drops
[Jes/Kry] All you gotta do is just say yes (All you gotta do is just say yes)
[Jes/Kry] If you are feeling like it is getting to hot (Ooh~)

Yes! Now turn and turn and get in
Yes! We’re gonna get it get high in
Yes! So when I roll it up all on ya
Don’t say no, I’m too shy
when I get to know ya.
Yes! We can row on this two seater
Yes! You’ve got the pain all on our lovebeat
Yes! Just make it happen baby
Don’t say no. Baby don’t say No!
(Ooh Say Yes)
