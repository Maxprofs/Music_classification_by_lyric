                        Bài hát: Tomorrow Never Came - Lana Del Rey, Sean Lennon

[Verse 1: Lana Del Rey]
"Hey, what you doing?" Not a lot
Shaking and moving at my local spot
Baby, don't ask me why, don't ask me why
Why, why, why, why, why, why

[Pre-Chorus 1: Lana Del Rey]
Lay, Lady, lay on that side of a paradise
In the Tropic of Cancer
'Cause if I had my way, you would always stay
And I'd be your tiny dancer, honey

[Chorus 1: Lana Del Rey]
I waited for you
In the spot you said to wait
In the city, on a park bench
In the middle of the pouring rain
'Cause I adored you
I just wanted things to be the same
You said to meet me up there tomorrow
But tomorrow never came
Tomorrow never came

[Verse 2: Sean Lennon]
Hey, what you thinking? Penny for your thoughts
Those lights are blinking on that old jukebox
But don't ask me why, just swallow some wine
Wi-wi-wi-wi-wi-wi-wi-wine

[Pre-Chorus 2: Sean Lennon]
Stay, baby, stay on the side of a paradise
In the Tropic of Cancer
'Cause if I had my way, you would always stay
And you'd be my tiny dancer, baby

[Chorus 1: Lana Del Rey & Sean Lennon]
I waited for you
In the spot you said to wait
In the city, on a park bench
In the middle of the pouring rain
'Cause I adored you
I just wanted things to be the same
You said you'd meet me out there tomorrow
But tomorrow never came
Tomorrow never came

[Bridge: Lana Del Rey, both]
Roses out in your country house
We played guitar in your barn
And everyday felt like Sunday
And I, I wish we had stayed home
And I could put on the radio to our favorite song
Lennon and Yoko, we would play all day long
"Isn't life crazy?", I said now that I'm singing with Sean
Whoa

[Chorus 2: Lana Del Rey & Sean Lennon]
I could keep waiting for you
In the spot we always wait
In the city, on the park bench
In the summer, on the pouring rain
Honey, don't ignore me
I just wanted it to be the same
You said you'd love me like no tomorrow
I guess tomorrow never came, no, no, no
Tomorrow never came, no, no
Tomorrow never came, no, no, no
Tomorrow never came
                        
                    |
