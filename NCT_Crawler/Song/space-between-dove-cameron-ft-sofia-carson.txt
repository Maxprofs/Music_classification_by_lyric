                        Bài hát: Space Between - Dove Cameron, Sofia Carson

I didn't know what you
We're going through
I thought that you were fine
what did you have to hide?
I didn't wanna let you down
But the truth is out
It's tearing me apart
Not listenin' to my heart

I really had to go
And I would never stop you
Even though we're changed
Nothing has to change

And you can find me in the space between
Where two worlds come to meet
I'll never be out of reach
Cause you're a part of me
So you can find me in the space between
You'll never be alone
No matter where you go
We can meet in the space between

There are no words left to say
I know you've gotta find your place
But this is not the end
No, you're part of who I am
Even if you're worlds apart 
You're still in my heart
It's will always be
You and me
Yeah

You can find me in the space between
Where two worlds come to meet 
I'll never be out of reach
I'll never be out of reach no
Cause you're a part of me 
So you can find me in the space between
You'll never be alone
No matter where you go
We can meet in the space between
Yeah, no matter where you go
No matter where you go

WE CAN MEET IN THE SPACE BETWEEN
