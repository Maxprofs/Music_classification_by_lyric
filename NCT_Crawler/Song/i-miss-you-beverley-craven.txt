                        Song: I Miss You - Beverley Craven

Here in the silence I wait
There's nothing else I can do
It feels like my heart's gonna break
And all I can think of is you
And how my aching arms long to hold you
And show you how much I care
But I'm counting the hours without you
And I don't know how much I can bear
'cause I miss you
More than words can say
And I need you here
In my life always
Yeah I miss you
And I'll always be
Waiting here for you
Til you're back with me

You found a place in my heart
From the first moment I saw you
And you are my light in the dark
And I would do anything for you
'cause you're everything I've ever wished for
The answer to all of my dreams
And I want you back
Home is here with me

Oh I miss you
More than words can say
And I need you here
In my life always
Yeah I miss you
And I'll always be
Waiting here for you
Til you're back with me

Yes I, would be right there beside you
If I only knew where you are
'cause it feels like I'm dying without you
My whole world falling apart
