                        Bài hát: Kiss Me OST - Mike D. Angelo

I can only look, secretly look at you from afar from right here
But why won't you turn my way ?
I want to know how you feel
Please tell me, do you have feelings for me ?
Each time you act like you don't care 
Each time you take good care of me
One moment you're bad, the next you are good
Please just let me know what you want 
Oh I just wanted you to kiss me, baby
Change this world pink 
Oh, baby, I just want to kiss you, baby
Let us have true love
I don't know what I must do
When I see you, when I'm mear you, my heart pounds
But our hearts are never the same
What do you want me to do ? 
I want to say it
Though sometimes I might seem like I don’t care
But I’ll take good care of you in time
I just want to let you know the things I want in my heart, okay?

Oh I just wanted you to kiss you, baby
Change this world pink
Oh, baby, I just want to kiss me, baby
Let us have true love

Love is overflowing from my heart
So many events made you and I find true love in our hearts
Love is overflowing from my heart
I’ll do good things for you, and I’ll only love you forever .
