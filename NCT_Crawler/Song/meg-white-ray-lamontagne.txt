                        Meg White, you're alright
 In fact I think you're pretty swell, can't you tell?
 Meg White, such a pretty thing
 I saw your face on the cover of a magazine Someday I'd like to take a walk with you
 Maybe ride our bikes down by the seaside Meg White, saw you on the big screen
 Oh Jack was Gene but she stole the scene
 Meg White, baby you're the bomb
 Oh Jack is great don't get me wrong but this is your song Someday I'd like to take a walk with you
 And talk about most anything you'd like to talk about
 And watch the sun going down, going down Playing those drums is what you do, it's true
 Nobody plays them quite like you do Meg White, you're alright
 In fact I think you're pretty swell, can't you tell?
 Meg White, such a pretty thing
 I saw your face on the cover of a magazine Someday I'd like to take a walk with you
 Maybe ride our bikes down by the seaside
 To watch the sun going down, going down
 Going down, going down
