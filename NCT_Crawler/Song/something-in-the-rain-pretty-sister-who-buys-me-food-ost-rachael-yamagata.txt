                        Bài hát: Something In The Rain (Pretty Sister Who Buys Me Food OST) - Rachael Yamagata

I feel you now from here
Our time is not done yet
You’ve given me
My fullest heart
We’ll never be apart

I’m breathing
Through you now
The love we have so true
I never thought
That I could need someone
The way I do

And we’re meant to be
This is one thing I know
I feel everything
I’ve never been so exposed
Are there pieces still yet
To be discovered
With your love
I can see anything
Through wherever you are
I can feel you

Your smile, your touch
Your voice
Each detail in your face
I can study everything
About you forever more

The way you look at me
Connecting with you now
You give me a strength
I’ve never known
You’ve reached into my soul
                        
                    |
