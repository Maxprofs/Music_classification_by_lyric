                        Bài hát: I Can't Believe (Khi Tình Nhạt Phai) - V.A

Since I fell in love
I never want you to leave
You bring to me
Everything I never knew before

You’ll always be the one for me
Do you feel that way too?
I’m no longer feeling lonely
Is this you were my destiny?
You and me

Chorus:
I can’t believe that you’re loving me
Could it be? I haven’t wished it secretly
I can’t belive that if I burn it
Could it be ever made you specially for me?

When you need me, I’ll be with you
You know I’m always there for you
When you want me, I’ll be with you
You know I’m always by your side
                        
                    |
