                        Bài hát: True Love - Ariana Grande

On the first day of Christmas
When you gave me all my wishes, boy!
You showed me things
Come hold me please, and never let me go
On the second day of Christmas
Said you felt like something's missing
So you promised me that promise ring to keep 'til we get old, boy
On the third day of Christmas
We got all in our feelings
Said I love you and meant it
On the fourth we committed
Any time, he could get it
He's the real one I know it

Look at all the things my true love gave to me
My true love!
My true love!
You are my true love
Look at all the things my true love gave to me
My true love!
My true love!
You are my true love
Ah ah ah ah ah ah...
(You are my true love)

On the fifth day of christmas
You asked me what's on my wish list
And I told you all I wanted was for ever with my boo
After six days on your arms
I got that tattoo in my heart
'cause I'm your moonlight, you're my star, and nothing's shining more than you


You completed the vision
Now I feel like I'm living
You're so one in a million
Ahhhh
I'm so glad we committed
Any time he could get it
He's the real one I know it

Look at all the things my true love gave to me
My true love!
My true love!
You are my true love
Look at all the things my true love gave to me
My true love!
My true love!
You are my true love
Ah ah ah ah ah ah...
(You are my true love)
