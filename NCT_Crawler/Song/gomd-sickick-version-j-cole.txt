                        Bài hát: G.O.M.D (Sickick Version) - J. Cole

[Intro]
Yeah

[Chorus]
They call me the freak of the fall
*** a little bit (ch), I've come to take it all
I'mma, I'mma ghost, who the *** you gon' call?
Mossin' with a scarecrow in the field, no
Lucifer reborn as a God
Feast on the blood drippin' down my jaw
Step out of my line and get outlined in chalk
Prince of the dark and the dead will walk

[Verse]
I can feel my enemy begin to fear my drum
I am ready, when it comes to pain I'm numb
I could tell you things you won't believe I've done
I kill to feel alive
I can feel my enemy begin to fear my drum
I am ready, when it comes to pain I'm numb
I could tell you things you won't believe I've done
I kill to feel alive

[Outro]
Me, oh, my, I'm that ghost
Oh, me, oh, my, I'm that ghost
Me, oh, my, I'm that ghost
Oh, me, oh, my, I'm that ghost
Me, oh, my, I'm that ghost
Oh, me, oh, my, I'm that ghost
Me, oh, my, I'm that ghost
                        
                    |
