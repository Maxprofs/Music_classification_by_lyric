                        (Break It, Break It Down)
 (You don't mean nothing at all to me)
 (Break it, break it, break it, break it, down)

 In the day
 In the night
 Say it right
 Say it all
 You either got it
 Or you don't
 You either stand or you fall
 When your will is broken
 When it slips from your hand
 When there's no time for joking
 There's a hole in the plan

 Oh you don't mean nothing at all to me
 No you don't mean nothing at all to me
 But you got what it takes to set me free
 Oh you could mean everything to me

 I could say (say)
 That I'm not (not)
 Lost (lost)
 And at fault (fault)

 I could say (say)
 That I don't (don't)
 Love the light (light)
 And the dark (love the light)

 I could say (say)
 That I don't (don't)
 Know that I (I)
 Am alive (alive)
 And I'll love (love)
 What I feel (feel)
 I could show (show you)
 You tonight
 You tonight

 Oh you don't mean nothing at all to me
 No you don't mean nothing at all to me
 But you got what it takes to set me free
 Oh you could mean everything to me

 From my hands I could give you
 Something that I made

 From my mouth I could
 Sing you another brick that I laid

 From my body (from ny body)
 I could show you (I could show you)
 A place (a place)
 God knows (that only god knows)

 You should know the space is holy
 Do you really want to go? (two, three, four)
 (You don't mean no nothing at all to me)
 (You don't mean nothing at all to me)
