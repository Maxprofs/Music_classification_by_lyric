Come on boy
I've been waiting for somebody
To pick up my stroll

Well don't waste time
Give me a sign
Tell me how you wanna roll

I want somebody to speed it up for me
Then take it down slow
There's enough room for both

Well, I can handle that
You just gotta show me where it's at
Are you ready to go

If you want it
You already got it
If you thought it
It better be what you want
If you feel it
It must be real just
If you say it, it better be what you want
