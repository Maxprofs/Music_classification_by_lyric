                        Bài hát: Sunsetz - Cigarettes After Sex

Sun sets, we wander through a foreign town
Strangely, there's nobody else around
See you open your dress and show me your tights
On the swing set at the old playground

And when you go away, I still see you
The sunlight on your face in the rearview

Sun sets, I want to hear your voice
A love that nobody could destroy
Took photographs like prodigals
Book covers that we both adored

And when you go away, I still see you
The sunlight on your face in my rearview
This always happens to me this way
Recurring visions of such sweet days

And when you go away, I still see you
The sunlight on your face in my rearview
When you go away, I still see you
The sunlight on your face in my rearview
                        
                    |
