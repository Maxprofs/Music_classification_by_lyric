Rock|

                        He was standing at the rock
 Gathering the fog
 Getting there with no directions
 And underneath the arch
 Turned into a march
 And there he found a spot to set this fucker on Set if off, set it on my children
 Set it right
 Set it off, set it off my children
 Alright
 Set it off, set it on my children
 Set it fire
 Set it off, set it on my children Suddenly a shot
 Ripped into his heart
 He needed some attention
 And there he played his card
 Going into shock
 The last thing that he said was set this fucker on Set if off, set it on my children
 Set it right
 Set it off, set it off my children
 Alright
 Set it off, set it on my children
 Set it fire
 Set it off, set it on my children Alright, alright, alright
 Alright, alright, alright Jesus at the back door, everything is alright
 All we need is some direction
 Every time the wind blows, everything you don't know
 Turns into a revelation
 It all ends up inside your head
 Time is wasted Set if off, set it on my children
 Set it right
 Set it off, set it off my children
 Alright
 Set it off, set it on my children
 Set it fire
 Set it off, set it on my children Alright, alright, alright
 Alright, alright, alright
