                        Bài hát: Compass - Zella Day

We can build a tree-house in the pine trees
We can keep our secrets buried underneath
Why it's always crushed between your fingers
Craving to the wild things are raved eyes

COMPASS points your home, 
Calling out from the east
COMPASS points you anywhere
Closer to me
If we make it out alive, from the depths of the sea
COMPASS points you anywhere
Closer to me
Where you are, I will be
Miles high, in the deep
Where you are, I will be
Anywhere, in between

Take me to the garden of your ecstasy
Make myself a heaven from your falling leaves
Loving in the fabric of your tapestry
Cover me in honey, circle memories

COMPASS points your home, 
Calling out from the east
COMPASS points you anywhere
Closer to me
If we make it out alive, from the depths of the sea
COMPASS points you anywhere
Closer to me
Where you are, I will be
Miles high, in the deep
Where you are, I will be
Anywhere, in between

I will take the pieces, put them back together
Even when the grass isn't green enough
Taking all the badges, build ourselves a mansion
Love you in the way that you need the love

Where you are, I will be
Where you are, I will be
                        
                    |
