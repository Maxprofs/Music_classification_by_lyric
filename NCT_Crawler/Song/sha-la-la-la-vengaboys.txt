                        Sha la la la 
Vengaboys 
There's a boy in my mind and he knows
I am thinking of him
All my way through the day and the night
Stars shine above me
He's been gone for sum time
But i know i truley love him
And iam singing a song
Hoping he'll be back when he hears it

My heart goes shalalala shalala in the morning
Shalalala shalala in the sunshine
Shalalala shalala in the evening
Shalalala shalala just for you!

(Make some noise for the vengaboys!)

If your lucks gone away just like mine
You feel like crying
Sing along maybe once
Maybe twice lets try it together
Some sweet day no one knows you'll return and you'll be happy
Shouting sweet in a song
Listen to your heart it is singing

My heart goes shalalala shalala in the morning
Shalalala shalala in the sunshine
Shalalala shalala in the evening
Shalalala shalala just for you!

My heart goes shalalala shalala in the morning
Shalalala shalala in the sunshine
Shalalala shalala in the evening
Shalalala shalala just for you!

Shalalala shalala just for you!
