                        Love and mercy ( contact: sonofgod_95)

I was sitting in a crummy movie with my hands on my chin
all the violence that occurs seems like we never win
Oh, love and mercy are what you need tonight
Love and mercy to you and your friends tonight

I was lying in my room and the news came on TV
there's a lot of people out there hurting and it really scares me
Oh, love and mercy are what you need tonight
Love and mercy to you and your friends tonight

I was standing in a bar and watching all the people there
all the loneliness in this world - it's just not fair
Oh, love and mercy are what you need tonight
Love and mercy to you and your friends tonight
