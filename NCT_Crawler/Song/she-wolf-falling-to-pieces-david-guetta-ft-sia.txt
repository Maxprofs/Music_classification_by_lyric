                        [Verse 1]

A shot in the dark
A past lost in space
Where do I start
The past and the chase
You hunted me down
Like a wolf, a predator
I felt like deer in love lights

[Chorus]

You loved me and I froze in time
Hungry for that flesh of mine
But I can't compete
With a she wolf who has brought me to my knees
What do you see in those yellow eyes
Cause I'm falling to pieces

I'm falling to pieces
Falling to pieces
I'm falling to pieces
Falling to pieces

[Verse 2]

Did she lie in wait
Was I bait to pull you in
The thrill of the kill
You feel, is a sin
I lay with the wolves
Alone, it seems
I thought I was part of you

[Chorus]

You loved me and I froze in time
Hungry for that flesh of mine
But I can't compete
With a she wolf who has brought me to my knees
What do you see in those yellow eyes
Cause I'm falling to pieces

I'm falling to pieces
Falling to pieces
I'm falling to pieces
Falling to pieces

[Ending]

I'm falling to pieces
Falling to pieces
I'm falling to pieces
Falling to pieces
                        
                    |
