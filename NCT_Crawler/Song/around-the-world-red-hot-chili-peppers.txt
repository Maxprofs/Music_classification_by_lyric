                        All around the world
We could make time
Rompin?and a stompin?
ause I in my prime
Born in the north
And sworn to entertain ya
ause I down for
The state of Pennsylvania
I try not to whine
But I must warn ya
out the motherfuckin' girls
From California
Alabama baby
Said hallelujah
Good god girl
I wish I knew ya
I know I know for sure
That life is beautiful around the world
I know I know it you
You say hello and then I say I do

Come back baby
ause I like to say
Ie been around the world
Back from Bombay
Fox hole love
Pie in your face
Living in and out
Of a big fat suitcase
Bonafide ride
Step aside my Johnson
Yes I could
In the woods of Wisconsin
Wake up the cake
It a lake she kissin?me
As they do when
When they do in Sicily
I know I know for sure
That life is beautiful around the world
I know I know it you
You say hello and then I say I do

Where you want to go
Who you want to be
What you want to do
Just come with me
I saw God
And I saw the fountains
You and me girl
Sittin?in the Swiss mountains
Me Oh My O
Me and Guy O
Freer than a bird
ause wee rockin?Ohio
Around the world
I feel dutiful
Take a wife
ause life is beautiful
I know I know for sure

I know I know it you

Mother Russia do not suffer
I know youe bold enough
Ie been around the world
And I have seen your love
I know I know it you
You say hello then I say I do
