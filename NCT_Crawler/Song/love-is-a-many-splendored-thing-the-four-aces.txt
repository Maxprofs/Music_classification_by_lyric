                        Love is a many splendored thing
 It's the April rose that
 Only grows in the early spring

 Love is nature's way of giving
 A reason to be living
 The golden crown
 That makes a man a king

 Once on a high and windy hill
 In the morning mist
 Two lovers kissed
 And the world stood still

 Then your fingers touched
 My silent heart and
 Taught it how to sing

 Yes, true love's
 A many splendored thing

 Once on a high and windy hill
 In the morning mist
 Two lovers kissed
 And the world stood still

 Then your fingers touched
 My silent heart and
 Taught it how to sing

 Yes, true love's
 A many splendored thing
                        
                    |
