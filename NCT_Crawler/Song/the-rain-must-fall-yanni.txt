Title: If The Rain Must Fall
Oh life can be strange
Good and bad in so many ways
And in time you will find
That things are not always what they seem

Well i've got something to say
But you might laugh, joke or run away
Coz i'm awkward and nervous
Sometimes i dont say much at all

But if the rain must fall
If i lose it all
If the world comes down and takes my soul
If the sky turns black
And theres no no way back
It won't matter much to me
If i had you
All i need is your love
That's all i need
All i need is your love

Oh well dreams can come true
if you know inside
you really want them to
or you can sit you can wait
You can leave your fate in someone
elses hands
Oh but I, I want you
And nothing else
can make me feel the way you do
So i'm waiting, i'm wishing
That it's me you'll be holding tonight
and every night

But if the rain must fall
If i lose it all
If the world comes down and takes my soul
If the sky turns black
And theres no no way back
It won't matter much to me
If i had you
cause all i need is your love
All i need is your love
your love

All i need is your love

it's all i need
nothing else
nothing else

it's all I need, is you

If the rain must fall
If i lose it all
If the world comes down and takes my soul
If the sky turns black
If theres no no way back
It won't matter much to me
If i had you

coz all i need is your love
