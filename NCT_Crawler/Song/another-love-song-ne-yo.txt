[Intro]
La la la la la
La la la la
La la la la la
Amma sing it again like
La la la la la
La la la la
La la la la la

[Verse 1]
It's your eyes, I swear it's looking me like bahame melodies
Sweet as melodies
Makes your way to smile, babe
Come together for a perfect harmony
Prettiest song will ever be

[Pre-Chrous]
Now, ain't got no game, babe
Ain't got no game
But, ain't got no shame
Ain't got no shame
And I don't know what it is
When I hear your name

[Chrous]
Suddenly I just gonna say
You make me wanna sing another love song
Loud enough for everybody to hear
You make me wanna sing another love song
And it started from the day you appeared

You make me wanna sing
You make me wanna sing
Girl, You make me wanna sing
You make me wanna sing another love song

[Verse 2]
It's your mouth girl when you're smiling
You're smiling just for me
Nobody but me girl
Say the word babe
Anything you want that's what's it gonna be
I promise that's what's it gonna be

[Pre-Chrous]
Now, ain't got no game, babe
Ain't got no game
But, ain't got no shame
Ain't got no shame
And I don't know what it is
When I hear your name

[Chrous]
Suddenly I just gonna say
You make me wanna sing another love song
Loud enough for everybody to hear
You make me wanna sing another love song
And it started from the day you appeared

You make me wanna sing
You make me wanna sing
Girl, You make me wanna sing
You make me wanna sing another love song

[Bridge]
Baby let me sing
La la la la la
La la la la
La la la la la
Amma sing it again like
La la la la la
La la la la
La la la la la
Everybody love somebody sing it with me
La la la la la
La la la la
La la la la la

[Chrous]
Girl, You make me wanna sing another love song
Loud enough for everybody to hear
You make me wanna sing another love song
And it started from the day you appeared
You making me wanna sing
You make me wanna sing

You make me wanna sing
You make me wanna sing
You make me wanna sing
You make me wanna sing another love song
