                        Bài hát: Moving Target - Shayne Ward

Never wanted to make it happen
I’ve been running since god
Knows when
I was building a wall around me
Don’t swear that you love me
Don’t wanna be hurt again

You’ve got that perfect smile
(don’t wanna be in your sights)
You wanna get inside
(don’t wanna be on your mind)
I’m under lock and key
This isn’t meant to be
I’m running, running, goodbye

Keep moving
I just keep moving along
Where i’m going
I can’t stand still for too long
Cupid’s arrow
Shooting from the shadows
But i, i
I won’t let ‘em hit me no more

I’m the guy who can love and leave you
I know you’re trying to change my mind
Don’t waste your time where
There is no feeling
I don’t mean to hurt you
But i’m leaving you behind

You’ve got the sweetest kiss
(don’t wanna be in your life)
I know i’m gonna miss
(don’t wanna be in your plan)
You stole the heart in me
And that’s a part of me
You’ll never see, never see me cry

Keep moving
I just keep moving along
Where i’m going
I can’t stand still for too long
Cupid’s arrow
Shooting from the shadows
But i, i
I won’t let ‘em hit me no more

Moving target
I won’t let ‘em hit me no more
Moving target
I won’t let ‘em hit me no more
Cupid’s arrow
Shooting from the shadows
But i, i
I won’t let ‘em hit me 

I’m gonna dodge that arrow
When it comes at my heart
Like a bolt in the dark
In the shadow
Ain’t nobody, nobody can get to me

Keepmoving
I just keep moving along
Where i’m going
I can’t stand still for too long
Cupid’s arrow
Shooting from the shadows
But i, i
I won’t let ‘em hit me no more

Moving target
I won’t let ‘em hit me no more
Moving target
I won’t let ‘em hit me no more
Cupid’s arrow
Shooting from the shadows
But i, i
I won’t let ‘em hit me no more
                        
                    |
