                        [Intro]
 (Ohh wooaahhh) x3

 [Verse 1]
 You know you love me
 I know you care
 Just shout whenever, 
 And I'll be there
 You want my love
 You want my heart
 And we would never, ever, ever be apart

 [Verse 2]
 Are we an item?
 Girl quit playin'
 We're just friends, 
 What are you sayin'?
 Said there's another as you look right in my eyes
 My first love, broke my heart for the first time

 [Chorus]
 And I was like
 Baby, baby, baby ooh
 Like
 Baby, baby, baby noo
 Like
 Baby, baby, baby ohh
 I thought you'd always be mine (mine)
 Baby, baby, baby ohh
 Like
 Baby, baby, baby noo
 Like
 Baby, baby, baby ohh
 I thought you'd always be mine (mine)

 [Verse 3]
 Oh oh For you, I would have done whatever
 And I just can't believe we ain't together
 And I wanna play it cool 
 But I'm losin' you
 I'll buy you anything
 I'll buy you any ring
 Cause I'm in pieces
 Baby fix me
 And just shake me till you wake me from this bad dream
 I'm goin down, down, down, down
 And I just can't believe my first love won't be around

 [Chorus]
 And I'm like
 Baby, baby, baby ohh
 Like
 Baby, baby, baby noo
 Like
 Baby, baby, baby ohh
 I thought you'd always be mine (mine)
 Baby, baby, baby ohh
 Like
 Baby, baby, baby noo
 Like
 Baby, baby, baby ohh
 I thought you'd always be mine (mine)

 [Verse 4]
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
 I'm sixteen and I thought that you'd be mine, 
 I used to tweet you and text you and call you and hit you on Facebook all the time, 
 But, but, but now your gone, 
 So far along that I can't even find you, 
 You know that feeling when you leave your love and it's right behind you, 
 Can't believe that you did me wrong, 
 We were on i-Chat all night long, 
 Listening to our favorite songs, 
 She was wrong I am gone, 
 I thought I loved her, never put no one above her, 
 Yeah she was my lover, but now onto another like... 

 [Chorus]
 Baby, baby, baby ohh
 Like
 Baby, baby, baby noo
 Like
 Baby, baby, baby ohh
 I thought you'd always be mine (mine)
 Baby, baby, baby ohhh
 Like
 Baby, baby, baby, noo
 Like
 Baby, baby, baby ohh
 I though you'd always be mine (mine)

 [Outro]
 I'm gone
 Yeahh, yeah, yeah
 Yeahh, yeahhh
 Now I'm all gone
 Yeahh, yeah, yeah
 Yeahh, yeahhh
 Now I'm all gone
 Yeahh, yeah, yeah
 Yeahh, yeahhh
 Now I'm all gone, gone, gone, gone
 I'm gone
                        
                    |
