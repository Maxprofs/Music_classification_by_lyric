                        Bài hát: Summer On You - Sam Feldt, Lucas, Steve

[Verse 1]
We were in love with the sun
We were in love with the sun, sippin' a coke and rum
Way head up in the clouds but when I look back now
Ain't nothing else I would do
When I spend the summer on you

[Verse 2]
Our troubles all under rocks
Our troubles all under rocks, filling our plastic cups
Don't bother if inside we spend those long hot nights
Until the sky turned blue
When I spend the summer on you
[Chorus]
I spend the summer on you
When I spend the summer on you

[Verse 3]
Most things in life ain't free
Most things in life ain't free but you're all that I need
My feet down in the sand, do you take the watch from my hand?
And said, "It's no more use"
When I spend the summer on you

[Verse 4]
We were in love with the sun
We were in love with the sun, sippin' a coke and rum
You asked me, "Are you sure? Cause I can not be returned"
And so I make my move
When I spend the summer on you

[Chorus]
When I spend the summer on you

[Bridge]
And when I look back on those days
There's not a thing that I would change
So when the year is through
I'll be right here to spend the summer on you

[Chorus]
When I spend the summer on you
When I spend the summer on you
                        
                    |
