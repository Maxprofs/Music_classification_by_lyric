                        Love's got teeth and she bites so hard
 Leaving you for dead like a deadly shark
 And she doesn't leave a lot to be saved I was swimming in the harbor of your smile
 Splashing in the ocean like a child
 I didn't know what dangers lurked there just beyond the waves
 Shark attack Well she chewed me up and she spat me out
 I didn't want to meet a man eater
 Shark attack
 Please don't mess around with me
 I'm a shark fatality, in the sea, I'm the one with the bleeding heart I thought you were a real lifesaver
 And life for once would do me a favor
 But baby's just a butcher and her teeth are razor sharp
 Shark attack Yeah she chewed me up and she spat me out
 I didn't want to meet a man eater
 Shark attack
 And I'm lost at sea and I'm an amputee
 And there was slaughter in the water when I fought her
 Shark attack, hey, hey, hey, hey Shark attack
 Well she doubled me up and she dribbled me out
 Didn't want to meet a man eater
 Shark attack
 Now I'm lost at sea and I'm an amputee
 And there was slaughter in the water when I fought her Shark attack, shark attack, shark attack
 Shark attack, shark attack, shark attack
