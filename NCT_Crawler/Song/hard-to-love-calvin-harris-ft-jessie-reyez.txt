                        Bài hát: Hard to Love - Calvin Harris, Jessie Reyez

I don't like to talk, but I love to sing
And I don't smoke, but I love to drink
I'm paranoid, I don't miss a thing
But I'm still nice, at least that's what I think
Fall in love, like I'm a freak
But then I pull out, and say, "I need freedom, I need freedom"

I guess I'll take it, heartbreaker
A title, I can't shake it, can't fake it
I guess I'll take it, heartbreaker
A title, I can't shake it, can't fake it

Baby, I'd rather be hard to love
Than easy to leave, you should believe me
Haven't you needed me?
I'd rather be hard to love
Than easy to leave, you should believe me
Haven't you needed me?

'Course you love me, you don't know me
But I got news for you, I came broken
Ego issues, my head is swollen
I got a million chips on my shoulder
But if you stick this by all I shoulder
Maybe you don't need freedom, freedom

I guess I'll take it, heartbreaker
A title, I can't shake it, can't fake it
I guess I'll take it, heartbreaker
A title, I can't shake it, can't fake it

Baby, I'd rather be hard to love
Than easy to leave, you should believe me
Haven't you needed me?
I'd rather be hard to love
Than easy to leave, you should believe me
Haven't you needed me?

Go deeper, go deep
I love it when your roots go deep so I know you won't leave
Go deeper, go deep
I love it when your roots go deep so I know you won't leave
Go deeper
I like being ugly, that way if they love me
I know that they love me for real
I like being ugly, that way if they love me
I know that they love me for real
I like being ugly, that way if they love me
I know that they love me for real
I like being ugly, that way if they love me
I know that they love me for real

Go deeper
Go deeper

Go deeper
Go deep

Oh my God, that feels nuts on its own
That *** feels like ***
That *** feels like, that *** feels like some ego tripping ***
