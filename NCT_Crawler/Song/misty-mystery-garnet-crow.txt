                        Bài hát: Misty Mystery - Garnet Crow

Why do you walk toward
The unforeseeable tomorrow with hope?
My heart is astir
As if I were still thinking about you

In exchange for break-up and tears,
What was it you obtained in your hands?
I come across the waning full moon
Said to be capable of delivering my prayers to you

That's the afterimage of a distant town,
the sweet memories revolve round and round
A scene just like a summer storm
Is all I'm shown

Sadness is a natural phenomenon
Tranquility is only an impression
The keyword that unlocks my feelings
Ahh, please find it
Like light from the meadows vanishing in the wind
Misty Mystery

Why is it that the strength of love
Seems to be tested every day?
Now, even that tenderness
Feels as distant as the blowing wind

Trying to endure the loneliness, the solitude
What is it that's been left behind here?
When I stopped wishing for things,
I finally noticed the boundlessness of the sky

I'm dreaming the same dream
Sometimes, suffering is essential
The bright sunbeams and the dizzying shade
Is all I'm watching

As for pain, that's nothing but a reaction
There's too much passion, and it's all imagined
The patterns in my heart are trembling- take it
Ahh, seeking it
The evening softly drinks it all up, Misty Mystery...

Down in its depths, the form of love is changing
If it seems there's something we still don't know
I'll keep to stay

That's the afterimage of a distant town,
the sweet memories revolve round and round
A scene just like a summer storm
Is all I'm shown

Sadness is a natural phenomenon,
peace is but an impression
The keyword that can unravel the patterns in my heart,
Ahh- I'm looking for it
The light from the meadows seems to vanish in the wind
Misty Mystery

Resounding throughout, it's a reckless impulse
                        
                    |
