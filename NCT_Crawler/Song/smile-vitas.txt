                        Bài hát: Smile - Vitas

Smile!
If the rain outside the window won't stop
Smile!
If you failed to do something
Smile!

If happiness hid behind the clouds
Even if your soul got slightly scratched
And you'll see how everything changes
Smile!
Rain will stop, the earth will dress up in snow

Smile!
And your sorrow will pass by
Smile !
And then, your soul will reborn
Smile!
