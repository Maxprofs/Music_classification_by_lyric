                        Bài hát: Street Knock - Swizz Beatz, A$AP Rocky

[Swizz Beatz]
Ridin' around in my Lotus
Sitting back and I'm focused
And the west side hocus pocus
Nigga see them pipes
Coming out at night
Niggas acting crazy, we dont really fight
Hit back with them Hammers
Watch out for them cameras
Niggas coming through
Popo put you in the slammers
I ain't got no time, I ain't doing no crime
Why you're talking to me
I ain't' dropping no dime
Sitting back in my shirt
Giovanni on my back, sitting million august
Bringin the dog back
LOX is here we back up in here
Double Rs here we come in to share
Back to back and I'm chillin
Kill em back and I'm healing
Niggas talkin crazy and I make a killin
Took over them companies
Took over *** trees
Kept them in my flight
Passport overseas
[Swizz Beatz]
Hey, right
1212, right, 1212, right
Get em
God damn it
[A$AP Rocky]
God damn it I'm a genius
Swagga is the meanest
Where green hair chick from venus on my penis
Twisted up our fingers
You know who my team is
Swatch em up and fold em then we treat them like them cleanest
Used to push the jag stolen tags get the stereo
Mouth row top, row full of gold material
88 back bass bumping through your stereo
Chicken noodle soup and mixing soda with the cereal
White like milk got beige like the Cheerio
Kicks and purple syrup and my breakfast is complete
New Black Scale *** that compliment the fleece
Reeboks red-bottoms straight from Swizzy on my feet
And some billionaire boy and some billionaire boys club
Plus probably push Bugatti that's the billionaire's toy huh
Woah Ke Mesabi I'm in junior once a naby
Meracami or Versace and Givanci on your boy huh
[Swizz Beatz]
Bitch
Hey, right
1212, right, 1212, right
Get em
God damn it
[Swizz Beatz]
Haters they can't stop me listen to A$AP Rocky
Walking to the club and bitches say I'm cocky
Walking to the club and bitches say I'm cocky
Walking to the club and bitches say I'm cocky
[Swizz Beatz]
Chill back when I'm lay back
Sitting back and I'm way back
Everybody may stay back
Let's gonna say that
Back back in them business
came back and gets this
Nigga wanna..can I get an witness
*** my own on fly
Bout through the sky Razcats in walls
God damn I'm fly
GT irons and all that, Cassos and all that
Rembrandts, you name it bitch I got it all
Yeah bouncin on my scrilla
Kickin back from out nilla
Bitch aks my color
I told that bitch vanilla
God damn it
Hey
