                        Bài hát: We Were Young - DVBBS

We were young, we were dumb 
We would do it all again 
We will never sleep 
We will stay up with our friends 

Where we go 
We don't know 
Where we go 
We don't know 

These memories will fade 
But we'll do it again 
We were high on youth 
Searching for our happy end 

Where we go 
We don't know 
Where we go 
We don't know 

We were young, we were dumb 
We would do it all again [3x] 

We were young, we were young [9x] 
Young, young, young, young.. 
We were young, we were dumb 

We were young, we were dumb 
We would do it all again 
We will never sleep 
We will stay up with our friends 

Where we go 
We don't know 
Where we go 
We don't know 

These memories will fade 
But we'll do it again 
We were high on youth 
Searching for our happy end 

Where we go 
We don't know 
Where we go 
We don't know 

We were young, we were dumb 
We would do it all again 
We will never sleep 
We will stay up with our friends 

Where we go 
We don't know 
Where we go 
We don't know 

We were young, we were dumb 

We would do it all again [3x] 

We were young, we were young [9x] 
Young, young, young, young.. 
We were young, we were dumb
                        
                    |
