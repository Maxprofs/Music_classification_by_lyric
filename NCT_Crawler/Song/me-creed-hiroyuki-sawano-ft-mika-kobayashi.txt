                        Bài hát: Me & Creed - Hiroyuki Sawano, Mika Kobayashi

[Verse 1]
You've heard that sound
Just from the ground
How long they've been in here
You've found the proof
That was the truth
Your daddy's face is on the way
People look into my face
I don't care about it
You've found out
How you were born
They scare me

[Bridge]
Disguise is not a word on my page
And I must be stronger than days before

[Chorus]
It's time for me
My sword and flame protect you
Just you can see the fire
We're flying in the sky
No one blames you, NO!
Forget your self abuse
Now we have grown and fast
Another chance to grasp the earth

[Verse 2]
Someday we'll rest in peace
I say it's not for real
One day it's gonna be
Between me and creed
Between me and creed

[Chorus]
It's time for me
My sword and flame protect you
Just you can see the fire
We're flying in the sky
No one blames you, NO!
Forget your self abuse
Now we have grown and fast
Another chance to grasp the earth

[Verse 1]
You've heard that sound
Just from the ground
How long they've been in here
You've found the proof
That was the truth
Your daddy's face is on the way
People look into my face
I don't care about it
You've found out
How you were born
They scare me
                        
                    |
