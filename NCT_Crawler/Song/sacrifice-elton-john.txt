                        Bài hát: Sacrifice - Elton John

When things go wrong 
When the scent of her lingers 
And temptation's strong 
Into the boundary 
Of each married man 
Sweet deceipt comes callin' 
And negativity lands 
Cold cold heart hard done by you 
Somethings look better baby 
Just passing through 
And it's no sacrifice just a simple word 
It's two hearts living 
In two separate worlds 
But it's no sacrifice 
No sacrifice 
It's no sacrifice at all 
Mutual misunderstanding 
After the fact 
Sensitivity builds a prison in the final act 
We lose direction 
No stone unturned 
No tears to damn you 
When jealousy burns 
Cold cold heart hard done by you 
Somethings look better baby 
Just passing through 
And it's no sacrifice just a simple word 
It's two hearts living 
In two separate worlds 
But it's no sacrifice 
No sacrifice 
It's no sacrifice at all 

Cold cold heart hard done by you 
Somethings look better baby 
Just passing through 
And it's no sacrifice just a simple word 
It's two hearts living 
In two separate worlds 
But it's no sacrifice 
No sacrifice 
It's no sacrifice at all 
No sacrifice at all 
No sacrifice at all 
No sacrifice at all
