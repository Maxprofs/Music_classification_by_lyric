                        Bài hát: Arrietty's Song - Cecile Corbel

I'm fourteen years old, I'm pretty 
Genki na chiisai lady 
Yuka shita ni zutto 
Karigurashi shiteta no 
Toki ni ha happy, toki ni ha blue 
Dareka ni aitai

( I'm fourteen years old, I'm pretty 
A light-hearted little lady 
For a long time, under the floor 
I've been living as a Borrower 
Sometimes I'm happy, sometimes I'm blue 
I'd love to meet somebody )

Kaze kami ni kanjite 
Sora wo nagametai 
Anata ni hana todoketai

( I want to feel the wind in my hair 
And to gaze at the sky 
I want to bring you a flower )

Mukou ha betsu no sekai 
Hora, chouchou ga matteru, watashi wo matteiru

( It's a different world out there 
Look, butterflies are dancing, waiting for me )

Sou, kawaru koto no nai 
Watashi no chiisai sekai 
Kirai jya nai no, demo anata wo 
Motto, motto shiritakute

( Yes, nothing ever changes 
In my little world 
It's not that I hate it, but I want to know 
More and more about you )

Yorokobi to kanashimi ha itsumo 
Orimazatte yuku

( My happiness and sadness always 
Get mixed up with each other )

Kaze kami ni kanjite 
Sora wo nagametai 
Anata ni hana todoketai

( I want to feel the wind in my hair 
And to gaze at the sky 
I want to bring you a flower )

Mukou ha betsu no sekai 
Hora, chouchou ga matteru, anata wo matteiru

( It's a different world out there 
Look, butterflies are dancing, waiting for you )

Taiyo no shita de hana ni kakomarete 
Anata to hibi sugoshitai 
Kono omoi wo mune ni 
Atarashii sekai de 
Watashi rashiku ikiru

( Under the sun and surrounded by flowers 
I want to spend the days with you 
With these memories in my heart 
I'll live my own way 
In a new world )
                        
                    |
