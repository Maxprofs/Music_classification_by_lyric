                        Much as you blame yourself,
You can't be blamed for the way that you feel
Had no example of a love, 
That was even remotely real
How can you understand
Something that you never had?
Ooh, baby, if you let me, 
I can help you out with all of that
Girl, let me love you,
And I will love you,
Until you learn to love yourself
Girl, let me love you,
I know your trouble
Don't be afraid,
Girl, let me help
Girl, let me love you,
And I will love you,
Until you learn to love yourself
Girl, let me love you,
A heart in numbness
Is brought to life,
I'll take you there
Hey, hey
(Girl, let me love you)
Girl, let me love you, baby, oh
(Girl, let me love you)
Girl, let me love you, baby
(Girl, let me love you)
Let me love you,
Let me love you, 
Oh
Ooh, 
I can see the pain behind your eyes, 
It's been there for quite a while
I just wanna be the one
To remind you what it is to smile, yeah
I would like to show you
What true love can really do
Girl, let me love you,
And I will love you,
Until you learn to love yourself
Girl, let me love you,
I know your trouble
Don't be afraid,
Girl, let me help
Girl, let me love you,
And I will love you,
Until you learn to love yourself
Girl, let me love you,
A heart in numbness
Is brought to life,
I'll take you there
Oh, oh, oh, hey
Girl, let me love you, baby
(Girl, let me love you)
Let me love you
Girl, let me love you, baby
(Girl, let me love you)
Girl, let me love you, baby
(Girl, let me love you)
Let me love you
Girl, let me love you, baby
For every heart that beats,
For every heart that beats,
For every heart that beats,
For every heart that beats
Heart that beats,
Heart that beats,
Heart that beats
Heart that beats
Girl, let me love you,
And I will love you,
Until you learn to love yourself
Girl, let me love you,
I know your trouble
Don't be afraid,
Girl, let me help
Girl, let me love you,
And I will love you,
Until you learn to love yourself
Girl, let me love you,
A heart in darkness
Is brought to life,
I'll take you there
(Girl, let me love you)
Darlin', let me love you, baby
Love you, baby, hey
(Girl, let me love you)
Let me love you, baby
You, babe
Ooh, ooh, oh
