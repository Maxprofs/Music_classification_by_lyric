R&B/Hip Hop/Rap|

                        There's not much you could do or say to phase me
 People think I'm a little bit crazy
 I get it from all angles, even occasionally Doc Drezy'll
 Have to step in every once in a while to save me To make me stop and think about it 'fore I just say things
 Sometimes I forget what other people just may think
 A lot of rappers probably wouldn't know how to take me
 If they heard some *** I layed to tape 'fore they erase me I may be a little too fast-paced and racy
 Sometimes the average listener rewinds and plays me
 Twenty times 'cause I say so many rhymes it may seem
 Like I'm going too fast cause my mind is racing And I could give a *** what category you place me
 Long as when I'm pushin' up daisies and gone
 As long as you place me amongst one of them greats
 When I the heavenly gates, I'd be cool beside Jay-Z For every single die-hard fan who embrace me
 I'm thankful for the talent in which God gave me
 And I'm thankful for the environment that he placed me
 Believe it or not, I thank my mom, far as she raised me In a neighborhood daily that jumped and chased me
 It only made me what I am today
 See regardless of what anybody believes who hates me
 You ain't gonna make or break me Tryin' to strip me of my credibility or make me look fake, G
 You're only gonna be in for a rude awakening
 'Cause sooner or later you haters are all gonna face me
 And when you face me with all the *** you've been savin' To say to me, you had all this time to think about it
 Now don't pussy out and try to wimp out, face me
 'Cause I've been patiently waitin' for the day
 That we finally meet, in the same place to see No matter how many battles I been in and won
 No matter how many magazines on my nuts
 No matter how many MC's I eat up
 Oh, it's never enough No matter how many battles I been in and won
 No matter how many magazines on my nuts
 No matter how many MC's I eat up
 Oh, it's never enough My flow's untouchable, now you gotta face it
 Uh oh, it gets worse when I go back to the basics
 You gon', say the wrong *** and get your whole face split
 The smell of victory love it so much I can taste it I spot my target, blaze it, direct hit, graze it
 Your peace talk, save it, your *** sounds, dated
 You're over-rated, I'm obli-gated
 To study your moves then crush you mother***ers If I'm the best and the worst then God's gift is a curse
 Soldier trained to destroy, you payin' attention boy?
 I spit ***, slick ***, so quick you miss ***
 To be specific I go ballistic, it's hieroglyphic My music is a drug, press play you ain't gotta sniff it
 Shoot it or pop it, roll it bag it or chop it
 It get you high over and over but you gotta cop it
 When it's hot it's hot, your hatin' is undeniable, stop it No matter how many battles I been in and won
 No matter how many magazines on my nuts
 No matter how many MC's I eat up
 Oh, it's never enough No matter how many battles I been in and won
 No matter how many magazines on my nuts
 No matter how many MC's I eat up
 Oh, it's never enough
