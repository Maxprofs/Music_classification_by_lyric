The Beatles - Hey Bulldog

Sheepdog
Standing in the rain
Bullfrog
Doing it again
Some kind of happiness is measured out in miles
What makes you think you're something special when you smile
Child-like
No one understands
Jack knife
In your sweaty hands
Some kind of solitude is measured out in years
You don't know what it's like to listen to your fears
You can talk to me
You can talk to me
You can talk to me
If you're lonely you can talk to me
(MUSIC...)
Big man
Walking in the park
Whigwam
Frightened of the dark
Some kind of innocence is measured out in you
You think you know me but you haven't got a clue
You can talk to me
You can talk to me
You can talk to me
If you're lonely you can talk to me
Hey bulldog Hey bulldog
Hey bulldog Hey bulldog
Hey bulldog Hey bulldog
