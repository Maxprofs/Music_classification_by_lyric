                        Til now, I always got by on my own
I never really cared until I met you
And now it chills me to the bone
How do I get you alone?

[P Reign]
I sit back and reminisce
It hurts to think about it all
We was on top of the world
Whoever though that we would fall?

Standing by the phone
Alone, ignoring your call
I feel like spider man
You got me flying off of the wall

I ain't wanna leave
But still I had to go
Cause what's good a rainbow
Without my pot of gold?

And now your beds empty
And your pillow's cold
You never realized the love
Until my love was gone
Yeah

[Alyssa Reid]
When you said I could move on and go
You said I'm weak and it shows
I couldn't go on without you

Now I'm sitting in this house alone
Wondering why I left home
And I'm hoping that you know that

Til now, I always got by on my own
I never really cared until I met you
(Til I met you)
And now it chills me to the bone
How do I get you alone?

[P Reign]
You act like you don't need me
'Cause you're scared of being needy
You want to have your cake and eat it to
I call that being greedy

And they say that love costs
Consider this a freebie
No one said this would be easy
Either love me or just leave me

Admit it, we too old for pretended
Ain't like our bond is broken
It just needed some mending

And when you need a hand
You know I'll be there to lend it
What's the point in having time
If I ain't there to help you spend it?
Yeah

I never really cared until I met you

How do I get you alone?

Til now, I always got by on my own
I never really cared until I met you
(Til I met you)
And now it chills me to the bone
How do I get you alone?
How do I get you alone?

I wonder where you are tonight
No answer on the telephone
And the night goes by so very slow
Woah, I hope that it won't end though
Alone...

And I'm hoping that you know that

Til now, I always got by on my own
I never really cared until I met you
(Til I met you)
And now it chills me to the bone
How do I get you alone?

Til now, I always got by on my own
I never really cared until I met you
(Til I met you)
And now it chills me to the bone
How do I get you alone?
How do I get you alone?
