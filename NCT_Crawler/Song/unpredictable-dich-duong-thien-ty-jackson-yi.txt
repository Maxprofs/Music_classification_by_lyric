                        Bài hát: Unpredictable / 易烊千玺 - Dịch Dương Thiên Tỷ (Jackson Yi)

Little bones, little coloured stones 
Try to keep, try to keep you warm 
If you wanna know, wanna know your mind 
Leave it all, leave it all behind. 
There are things, that are better left alone 
So many questions out of your control. 

I don't wanna know how this is gonna end 
Cuz it won't stop the rain from coming down again 
And i don't need that superstition fortune telling future magical 
I live a life unpredictable 
I live a life unpredictable. 

Little leaves, little leaves will form 
Try to see, try to see the storm 
If you wanna know, wanna know your heart 
Lose it all, lose it from the start. 
There are things, that are better left alone 
So many questions out of your control. 

I don't wanna know how this is gonna end 
Cuz it won' t stop the rain from coming down again 
And i don't need that superstition fortune telling future magical 
I live a life unpredictable 
I live a life unpredictable 
Unpredictable ! (x4) 

I don't wanna know how this is gonna end 
Cuz it won't stop the rain from coming down again . 

I don't wanna know how this is gonna end 
Cuz it won't stop the rain from coming down again 
And i don't need that superstition fortune telling future magical 
I live a life unpredictable 
I live a life unpredictable
