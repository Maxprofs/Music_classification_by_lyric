                        [Hook: Game + Pusha T]
 Open the pearling gates
 Bright white lights Madonna
 Angels lined up in my honor, ya’ honor
 Name Me King (x2)
 I took the crown, infiltrated their fortress
 Kidnap the queen, rode away in white horses
 Name Me King (x2)

 [Verse 1: Game]
 Brick by brick I built my fortress
 My queen beautiful, lamborghini is gorgeous
 Phantom in the courtyard, 400 horses
 Growl make the tower fall, 911 Porsches
 Number 9 Jordans pause the Air Forces
 Kush clouds, blunts lit by Olympic torches
 Gold bars melted and what returned Rolexes
 Niggas got Breitlings to burn
 Loyalty to earn
 Royalty to who it may concern this is Los Angeles King Snapback
 Sipping ‘tron out the Stanley cup, I don’t give a ***
 Drown them in the moat and let the bridge up
 My son, my heir in Nike Airs
 Named my little nigga King meaning you should bow at his feet before God intervene
 Even when I was in front of triple beams
 Stack paper to the ceiling, to the fiends I was king

 [Hook: Game + Pusha T]

 [Verse 2: Pusha T]
 Raise your glass for the last of the Kingpins
 The crown in the Maserati grill is mingling
 Rolly’s cross oceans like Frank out in England
 The gay Pride bezel rainbow like it’s spring again
 Haah crack rock, crack rock nigga
 My sc430 was a drop nigga
 Go figure, this nigga play goldfish
 My only pet was fish scale not a goldfish
 My young baby sitter now my old bitch
 Blowjobs to what I sold made her nose itch (Yeaghhhhh!)
 It’s the king being crowned, watch my predecessor fall like the sun going down (God!)
 It’s sunset, this is Sun Tzu (War!)
 He paved the way I brought a ton through (Whooo!)
 Been on his heels like a gum shoe
 He took the throne so I could run through (Yeaghhhhh!)

 [Hook: Game + Pusha T]

 [Verse 3: Game]
 Rose petals at my feet when I’m stepping out the Rolls
 The royal penis is clean, Versace belt gold
 Sweatin’ like a slave? Get sold
 Accompanied by fourteen karats stold
 Adjust the temperature let the heat rise up like Jesus shuttles worth in that glass jar
 Blue flame glowing like a Avatar
 Five more minutes says the silent gold hand going ’round on my Audemar
 Angels in the wing, ass naked do your thing
 Show me what that baking soda bring
 Do it for your king
 Every time I look up, they cook up
 I be the master of them p’s I got the hook up
 From New Orleans to Virginia
 I told her stuff them pies in her Virginia
 Never been caught, can’t be bought, she’s a winner
 Flying south for the winter make it back home for dinner
