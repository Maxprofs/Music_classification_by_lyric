                        Bài hát: Only Love - Hòa Tấu

2 a.m and the rain is falling
Here we are at the crossroads once again
You're telling me you're so confused
You can't make up your mind
Is this meant to be
You're asking me
But only love can say
Try again or walk away
But I believe for you and me
The sun will shine one day

So I'll just play my part
And pray you'll have a change of heart
But I can't make you see it through
That's something only love can do
                        
                    |
