                        Bài hát: Don't Turn Off The Lights - Enrique Iglesias 

I don't have to tell you
What this is all about
'Cause baby half the fun is in us
Figuring it all out

So why you gotta ask me
What I'm doing now
'Cause I don't like to question
What I still haven't found, ooh yeah

So don't turn off the lights
I don't wanna be in the dark tonight
'Cause I can't read your mind
I need to know if what I'm doing is right

So don't turn off the lights
So don't turn off the lights

So tell me how we're gonna get there
It's so hard to even try
But if we move together, oh yeah, yeah
We'll end up on the same side, ooh yeah

So don't turn off the lights
I don't wanna be in the dark tonight
'Cause I can't read your mind
[- From: -]
I need to know if what I'm doing is right

So don't turn off the lights
So don't turn off the lights

If you could know what I'm feeling
Would you run and where would you go
If you want to know what I'm thinking
Then just turn on the lights and you'll know, so don't

So don't turn off the lights
I don't wanna be in the dark tonight
'Cause I can't read your mind
I need to know if what I'm doing is right

So don't turn off the lights

So don't turn off the lights
I don't wanna be in the dark tonight
'Cause I can't read your mind
I need to know if what I'm doing is right

So don't turn off the lights
So don't turn off the lights

Don't turn off the lights
Don't turn off the lights
Don't turn off the lights
Don't turn off the lights
