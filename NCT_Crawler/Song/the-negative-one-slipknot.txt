                        Bài hát: The Negative One - Slipknot

[Vers 1]
Fire and caffeine, a lot of nicotine
I’m going to burn, so I better tell you everything
The competition, the superstition
Nevermind ‘cause you’re never gonna give in
It's a crisis just how you like it
The same drama in a different disguise
I'm bound to walk with a target on my back
At least I’m ready for another attack

[Chorus 1]
The Lord of lies
The morning star
You had to be set free
Opposing sides
Your choices are
The negative one and me

[Verse 2]
Svengali, why are we the enemies?
I never follow and I never make apologies
Your dementias, are gonna get ya
Because your walls can't support each other
Settle for the cynical, you're so political
You’re getting ready ‘cause the first move is critical
Reciprocity, somebody's listening
What did we learn from our time in captivity?

[Chorus 2]
The Lord of lies
The morning star
You had to be set free
Opposing sides
Your choices are
The negative one and me
The negative one and me

[Refrain]
I hope you live
To see the day
When your world comes up in flames
And as you die
You see my face
You're the only one to blame
(***)

[Bridge]
The Prescient, the Nascent
The quotient (They all will fall)
The Cystic, symbolic, condition (Systemic)
Egregious, replete with
These lesions (Contaminate)
Succumb to the selfish
Creation (Your failure)

[Verse 3]
No accountability, divisibility
I point a finger but it’s always looking back at me
The centipede's pulling on the mechanism
Unearthing scars of the cataclysm
When the innocent begin to circumvent
The color fades, but the picture is vibrant
What do you believe? Does it matter now?
Turn away, the killer is disavowed

[Chorus 2] + [Refrain] + [Chorus 2]

[Outro]
The negative one
The negative one
The negative one
The negative one and me
The negative one and me
The negative one and me
                        
                    |
