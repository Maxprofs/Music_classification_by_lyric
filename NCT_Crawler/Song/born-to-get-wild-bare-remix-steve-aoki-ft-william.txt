                        Bài hát: Born To Get Wild (Bare Remix) - Steve Aoki, will.i.am

Hey
Turn up the sound
And bring it loud so that everyone comes around
Get's wild, get's wild, get's wild

Cause we're getting crazy
We're burning down the town
We burn it down so that everyone comes around
Get's wild, get's wild, get's wild
Wild, wild, wild

We were born, we were born to get wild
We were born, we were born to get wild
We were born, we were born to get wild
We were born born born
We were born to get wild

We were born, we were born to get wild

I came with my people, my people
So we can get crazy and get in some ***
I can't make a loop, get stupid, call cupid
'Cause I want love me your chick
I can't make a dizzy, get tipsy, who wouldn't
Hey babe, co-come take a sip
Just sit with some baga, some baga
Some baga, some baga
Until you fall asleep

As soon as I step in the scene
Others brothers say "ah ah"
My status is *** supreme
So fresh and so clean
Wow, wow
I'm feeling like I am the king of the club
'Cause all sneezers love my style
I'm up in this moher, this mother
I'm up in this bitch, get wild

Turn up the sound
And bring it loud so that everyone comes around
Get's wild, get's wild, get's wild

Cause we're getting crazy
We're burning down the town
We burn it down so that everyone comes around
Get's wild, get's wild, get's wild
Wild, wild, wild

We were born, we were born to get wild
We were born, we were born to get wild
We were born, we were born to get wild
We were born born born
We were born to get wild

We were born, we were born to get wild
