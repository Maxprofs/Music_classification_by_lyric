                        Bài hát: Rotten To The Core - Dove Cameron, Cameron Boyce, Booboo Stewart, Sofia Carson

[Mal:]
They say I'm trouble
They say I'm bad
They say I'm evil
And that makes me glad

[Jay:]
A dirty no-good
Down to the bone
Your worst nightmare
Can't take me home

[Evie:]
So I've got some mischief
In my blood
Can you blame me?
I never got no love

[Carlos:]
They think I'm callous
A low-life hood
I feel so useless
Misunderstood

[Mal and Evie:]
Mirror, mirror on the wall
Who's the baddest of them all?
Welcome to my wicked world, wicked world

[Chorus:]
I'm rotten to the core, core
Rotten to the core
I'm rotten to the core, core
Who could ask for more?
I'm nothing like the kid next, like the kid next door
I'm rotten to the, I'm rotten to the
I'm rotten to the core

[Mal:]
Call me a schemer
Call me a freak
How can you say that?
I'm just... unique!

[Jay:]
What, me? A traitor?
Ain't got your back?
Are we not friends?
What's up with that?

[Evie:]
So I'm a misfit
So I'm a flirt
I broke your heart?
I made you hurt?

[Carlos:]
The past is past
Forgive, forget
The truth is...
You ain't seen nothing yet!

[Mal and Evie:]
Mirror, mirror on the wall
Who's the baddest of them all?
Welcome to my wicked world, wicked world

[Chorus:]
I'm rotten to the core, core
Rotten to the core
I'm rotten to the core, core
Who could ask for more?
I'm nothing like the kid next, like the kid next door
I'm rotten to the, I'm rotten to the
I'm rotten to the core
                        
                    |
