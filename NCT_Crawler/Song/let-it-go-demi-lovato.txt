                        Bài hát: Let It Go - Demi Lovato

(Chorus)
Let it go, let it go
Can’t hold it back anymore
Let it go, let it go
Turn my back and slam the door

(Verse)
The snow blows wide on the mountain tonight
Not a footprint to be seen
A kingdom of isolation
And it looks like I’m the queen

(Verse)
The wind is howling
Like the swirling storm inside
Couldn’t keep it in
Heaven knows I tried

(Verse)
Don’t let them in, don’t let them see
Be the good girl you always had to be
Can feel, don’t feel, don’t let them know
Well now they know

(Chorus)
Let it go, let it go
Can’t hold it back anymore
Let it go, let it go
Turn my back and slam the door
And yet I stay
Until I’ll say
Let it go, let it go
The cold never bothered me anyway

(Verse)
It’s funny how some day since
Makes everything seem small
And if here’s the ones controlled me
Can’t get to me at all

(Verse)
Up here in the cold thin air
I finally can breathe
I know I left a life behind
But I’m too relieved to breathe

(Chorus)
Let it go, let it go
Can’t hold it back anymore
Let it go, let it go
Turn my back and slam the door
And yet I stay
Until I’ll say
Let it go, let it go
The cold never bothered me anyway

(Bridge)
Standing, frozen
In the life I’ve chosen
You won’t find me
The past is there behind me
Buried in the snow

(Chorus)
Let it go, let it go
Can’t hold it back anymore
Let it go, let it go
Turn my back and slam the door
And yet I stay
Until I’ll say
Let it go, let it go
The cold never bothered me anyway

Let it go, let it go
Let it go
                        
                    |
