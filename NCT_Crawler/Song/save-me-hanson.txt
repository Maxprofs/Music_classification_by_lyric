                        (verse 1) Loving you
 like I never have before
 I'm needing you
 just to open up the door if beggin you
 might somehow turn the tides
 then tell me to
 I've gotta get this off my mind I never thought I'd be speakin these words
 never thought I'd need to say
 another day alone is more than I can take (chorus)
 won't you save me?
 'cause saving's what I need
 I just wanna be by your side won't you save me
 I don't wanna be
 just driftin through the sea of life (verse 2) won't you listen please?
 baby don't walk out that door
 I'm on my knees
 you're all I'm living for I never thought I'd be speakin these words
 heaven thought I'd find a way
 another day alone is more than I can take (chorus)
 won't you save me?
 'cause saving's what I need
 I just wanna be by your side won't you save me
 I don't wanna be
 just driftin through the sea of life (bridge)
 suddenly the sky is fallin
 could it be too late for me?
 if I never said I'm sorry
 then I'm wrong yes I'm wrong
 then I hear my spirit callin
 wonderin' if she's longin' for me
 and then I know that I can't live without her (chorus)
 won't you save me?
 'cause saving's what I need
 I just wanna be by your side
 won't you save me
 'cause I don't wanna be
 just drifting through the sea of life won't you save me?
 won't you save me?
 won't you save me?
