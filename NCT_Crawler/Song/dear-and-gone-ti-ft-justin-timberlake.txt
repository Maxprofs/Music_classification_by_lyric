                        Oooo,hey I've been travelin' on this road to long
Just trying to find my way back home
The old me is dead and gone... dead and gone...
Ooooooo I ve been travelin' on this road to long

Ever had one of them days you wish woulda stayd home
Run into a group of ni&&as getting they hate on
you walk by they get wrong you reply then sh*t get blown
Way outta proportion way past discussion 
Just u against them, pick one then rush em
Figure you get jump, yeah that next
They don’t wanna stop there now they bussin
Now u gushin', ambulance rushin' u to the hospital with a bad concussion
Plus ya hit four times bullet hit ya spine paralyzed waist down now ya wheel chair bound
Nevermind that now u lucky to be alive, Just think it all started you fussin' with three guys
Now ya pride in the way but ya pride is the way you could *uck around get shot die anyday
Ni&&as die every day all over bull sh*t dope money dice game ordinary hood sh*t 
Could this be cuz of hip hop music or did the ones with the good sense not use it
Usually ni&&as don’t know what to do whith their back against the wall so they just start shootin
For red or for blue or for blow I guess, from Bankhead upto ya projects
No more stray, now im straight, now I get it now I take
Time to think, before I make mistakes just for my family’s sake
That part of me left yesterday the heart of me is strong today
No regrets im blessed to say the old me dead and gone away.

I aint never been scared, I lived through tragic
Situations coulda been dead lookin back at it
Most of that sh*t didn’t even have to happen
But you don’t think about it when you out there trappin'
In apartments hangin smokin' and rappin'
Ni&&as start sh*t next thing ya know we cappin'
Get locked up then didnt even get mad
Now think about damn what a life I had
Most of that sh*t look back just laugh
Some sh*t still look back get sad
Maybe my home boy still be around 
Had I not hit the ni&&a in the mouth that time
I won that fight, I lost that war
I can still see my ni&&a walkin' out that door
Who’da thought I’d never see Philant no more
Got enough dead homies I don’t want no more
Cost a ni&&a his job, cost me more
I’da took that ass-whoopin now for sure
Now think before I risk my life
Take them chances to get my stripe
A ni&&a put his hands on me alright
Otherwise stand there talk sh*t all night
Cuz I hit you , you sue me, 
I shoot you, get locked up, who me?
No more stress, now im straight, now I get it now I take
Time to think before I make mistakes just for my family’s sake
That part of me left yesterday the heart of me is strong today
No regrets im blessed to say the old me dead and gone away.

I turn my head to the east... I don’t see nobody by my side
I turn my head to the west... still nobody in sight
So I turn my head to the north, swallow that pill that they call pride
The old me is dead and gone, the new me will be alright
I turn my head to the east... I don’t see nobody by my side
I turn my head to the west...
