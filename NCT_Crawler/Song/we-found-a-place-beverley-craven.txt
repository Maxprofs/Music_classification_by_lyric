                        There has to be a reason for this life
 I hope we keep a light
 To guide the way
 The voices in your heart will shine a light
 To set your spirit free
 And learn to fly
 We found a place
 Just you and i
 A time for friends
 Another life
 A chance for dreams
 Or just something else
 But most of all
 To find myself I understand so little of this life
 The only thing I know
 Is how I feel
 But you were there when I was all alone
 It means so much to me
 I'll always know We found a place
 Just you and i
 A time for friends
 Another life
 A chance for dreams
 Or just something else
 But most of all
 To find myself A chance for dreams
 Or just something else
 But most of all
 To find myself
 But most of all
 To find myself
