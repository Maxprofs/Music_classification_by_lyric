                        As time was ticking we were winning
 And it all was going as planned
 Politicians stand between the lines
 Of making headlines, street signs
 Saying, you're going the wrong way, fading faster now You can try to break us and make us fall apart
 But the fire's in our hearts
 Reminisce on memories 'cause we're gone And don't forget to hold back your thoughts
 And live like robots 'cause we all know what goes on
 Reminisce on memories 'cause we're gone, we're gone, so gone Fallen soldiers, all around us
 But we're still standing strong
 Embarrassing and contradicting
 'Cause now we're making headlines, prime time
 Saying, what a story, Billboards, packed tours, don't forget You can try to break us and make us fall apart
 But the fire's in our hearts
 Reminisce on memories 'cause we're gone And don't forget to hold back your thoughts
 And live like robots 'cause we all know what goes on
 Reminisce on memories 'cause we're gone, we're gone, so gone And game over, you're done, ooh
 Out of left field, we won
 And pack our bags, yeah, we'll run
 Hollywood, here we come You can try to break us and make us fall apart
 But the fire's in our hearts
 Reminisce on memories 'cause we're gone And don't forget to hold back your thoughts
 And live like robots 'cause we all know what goes on
 Reminisce on memories 'cause we're gone, we're gone You can try to break us and make us fall apart
 But the fire's in our hearts
 Reminisce on memories 'cause we're gone
