                        Bài hát: Take A Train To Lhasa - Wu Guo Zhong

Mountains are high, waters are deep,
the road to Heaven is too hard,
until this great sky road, like the giant dragon landing,

take the train to Lhasa, to see the legendary potala
and the most beautiful kelsang flower blossoming under the snow mountains

singing the song of happiness to Tangula mountain,
drinking the most fragrant and strongest hiland barley wine,
dancing to the most popular snow mountain langma,
getting drunk in the heavenly land
                        
                    |
