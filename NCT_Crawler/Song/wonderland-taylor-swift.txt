                        Bài hát: Wonderland - Taylor Swift

Flashing lights and we 
Took a wrong turn and we 
Fell down a rabbit hole. 

You held on tight to me 
'Cause nothing's as it seems 
I'm spinning out of control. 

Didn't they tell us don't rush into things? 
Didn't you flash your green eyes at me? 
Haven't you heard what becomes of curious minds? 

Ooooo 

Didn't it all seem new and exciting? 
I felt your arms twisting 'round me 
I should have slept with one eye open at night. 

We found wonderland 
You and I got lost in it 
And we pretended it could last forever 
aye 
We found wonderland 
You and I got lost in it 
And life was never worse but never better 
aye aye 

Aye [x5] 
In wonderland 
Aye [x5] 
In wonderland 
Aye [x5] 
In wonderland 
Aye [x5] 
In wonderland 

So we went on our way 
To and left a thing straight 
All alone or so it seemed. 

But there were strangers watching 
And whispers turned to talking 
And talking turned to screams. 

Oooooh 

Didn't they tell us don't rush into things? 
Didn't you flash your green eyes at me? 
Didn't you calm my fears with the Cheshire cat smile? 

Oooooh

Didn't it all seem new and exciting? 
I felt your arms twisting 'round me 
It's all fun and games 'til somebody loses their mind. 

But darling, we found wonderland 
You and I got lost in it 
And we pretended it could last forever 
aye 
We found wonderland 
You and I got lost in it 
And life was never worse but never better 
Aye Aye 

Aye [x5] 
In wonderland 
Aye [x5] 
In wonderland 
Aye [x5] 
In wonderland 
Aye [x5] 
In wonderland 

I reached for you but you were gone 
I knew I had to go back home 
You search the world for something else to make you feel like what we had 
And in the end in wonderland we both went mad. 

Oooooh 

We found wonderland 
You and I got lost in it 
And we pretended it could last forever (last forever) 
aye aye 
We found wonderland 
You and I got lost in it (got lost in it) 
And life was never worse but never better (never better) 
aye aye 

We found wonderland 
You and I got lost in it (wonderland) 
And we pretended it could last forever (in wonderland) 

We found wonderland 
You and I got lost in it (wonderland) 
And life was never worse but never better 
In wonderland
