                        Bài hát: All Falls Down - Alan Walker, Noah Cyrus, Digital Farm Animals 

[Verse 1: Noah Cyrus] 
What's the trick? I wish I knew 
I'm so done with thinking through all the things I could've been 
And I know you wonder too 
All it takes is that one look at you and I run right back to you 
You crossed the line and it's time to say F you 
What's the point in saying that when you know how I'll react? 
You think you can just take it back, but *** just don't work like that 
You're the drug that I'm addicted to, and I want you so bad 
Guess I'm stuck with you, and that's that 

[Chorus: Noah Cyrus] 
'Cause when it all falls down, then whatever 
When it don't work out for the better 
If we just ain't right, and it's time to say goodbye 
When it all falls down, when it all falls down 
I'll be fine, I'll be fine 
You're the drug that I'm addicted to 
And I want you so bad, but I'll be fine 

[Verse 2: James Arthur & Juliander] 
Why we fight? I don't know 
We say what hurts the most 
Oh, I tried staying cold, but you take it personal 
All these firing shots and making grounder 
It's way too hard to cope, but I still can't let you go 

[Chorus: Noah Cyrus & Juliander] 
'Cause when it all falls down, then whatever 
When it don't work out for the better 
If we just ain't right, and it's time to say goodbye 
When it all falls down, when it all falls down 
I'll be fine, I'll be fine 
You're the drug that I'm addicted to and I want you so bad 
But I'll be fine 

[Bridge] 
I'll be fine-ine-fine, fine-ine-ine 
I'll be fine-ine-fine, fine-ine-ine 
I'll be fine-ine-fine, fine-ine-ine 
I'll be fine-ine-fine, fine 

[Chorus: Noah Cyrus & Juliander, (Noah Cyrus, Juliander)] 
'Cause when it all falls down, then whatever 
(Then whatever, babe) 
When it don't work out for the better (For the better) 
If we just ain't right, and it's time to say goodbye 
When it all falls down (When it all, when it all) 
When it all falls down (When it all falls down) 
I'll be fine (Fine, fine, fine), I'll be fine (I'll be fine) 
You're the drug that I'm addicted to and I want you so bad 
But I'll be fine (I'll be fine), and that's that
