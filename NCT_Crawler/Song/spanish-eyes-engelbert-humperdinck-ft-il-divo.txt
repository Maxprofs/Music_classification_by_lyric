                        Bài hát: Spanish Eyes - Engelbert Humperdinck

Blue spanish eyes
Teardrops are falling from your spanish eyes
Please, please don't cry
This is just adios and not goodbye
Soon I'll return
Bringing you all the love your heart can hold
Please say si si
Say you and your spanish eyes will wait for me

Blue spanish eyes
Prettiest eyes in all of Mexico
True spanish eyes
Please smile for me once more before I go
Soon I will return
Bringing you all the love your heart can hold
Please say si si
Say you and your spanish eyes will wait for me
Say you and your spanish eyes will wait for me
