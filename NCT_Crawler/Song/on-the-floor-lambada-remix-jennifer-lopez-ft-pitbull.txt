                        Hey oh ay oh ay
Let’s take the whole world on a ride
J-LO!
Hey oh ay oh ay
Let’s take the whole world on a ride
Mr worldwide
Darling get on the floor
Darling get on the floor
Darling get on the floor
Darling get on the floor
Darling get on the floor
Darling I want the whole world to
Get on the floor
Darling get on the floor
Darling get on the floor
Darling get on the floor
Darling I want the whole world to
Get on the floor

I’m loose
And everybody knows I get off the train
Baby it’s the truth
I’m like inception I play with your brain
So I don’t sleep I snooze
I don’t play no games so don’t get it confused no
Cos you will lose yeah
Now pump it up
And back it up like a Tonka truck
That badonka donk is like a trunk full of bass on an old school Chevy

All I need is some vodka and some... coke
And watch... get donkey konged
... if you’re ready for things to get heavy
I get on the floor and act a fool if you let me
Don’t believe me just vet me
My name ain’t Keath but I see why you Sweat me
L.A. Miami New York
Say no more get on the floor

Dance the night away
Live your life and stay out on the floor
Dance the night away
Grab somebody drink a little more
La la la la la la la la la la la la la la
Tonight we gon’ be it on the floor
La la la la la la la la la la la la la la
Tonight we gon’ be it on the floor

I know you gotta clap your hands on the floor
And keep on rocking work it up on the floor
If you’re a criminal kill it on the floor
Steal it quick on the floor
On the floor
Don’t stop keep it moving put your drinks up
It’s getting ill it’s getting sick on the floor
We never quit we never rest on the floor
If...
