                        Bài hát: This Is Our Song (Camp Rock) - Demi Lovato, Joe Jonas, Nick Jonas, Alyson Stoner

So let's sing
Na, na-na-na, na
Hey, ya
Come on and sing
Na, na-na-na, na
Hey, ya

This is our song
That's all that matters
'Cause we all belong
Right here together
There's nothin' better
Than singin' along
This is our summer
This is our song

Come grab your guitar
Sit by the fire
'Cause we all need a song
When we're weary and tired
We'll sit here together
And sing it out loud
And sing it out loud

This is our song
That's all that matters
'Cause we all belong
Right here together
There's nothin' better
Than singin' along
This is our summer
And this is our song
This is our song
This is our song
This is our song

Come on and sing
Na, na, na, na, na
Hey, ya
Come on and sing
Na, na-na-na, na
Hey, ya
Come on and sing
Na, na-na-na, na
Hey, ya
Hey, ya

This is our song
That's all that matters
'Cause we all belong
Right here together
There's nothin' better
Than singin' along
This is our summer
Our summer

This is our song
That's all that matters
'Cause we all belong
Right here together
There's nothin' better
Than singin' along
This is our summer
And this is our song
This is our song
This is our song
This is our song
This is our song
This is our song
This is our song
