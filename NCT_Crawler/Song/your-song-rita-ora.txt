                        Bài hát: Your Song - Rita Ora

I woke up with a fear this morning 
But I can taste you on the tip of my tongue 
Alone without no warning 
You're by my side and we go smoking at lunch 

Last night we were way up, kissing in the back of the cab 
And then you say "love baby let's go back to my flat" 
And when we wake up, never had a feeling like that 
I got a reason so man, put that record on replay 

I don't want to hear sad songs anymore 
I only want to hear love songs 
I found my heart up in this place tonight 
Don't want to sing mad songs anymore 
Only want to sing your song 
Cause your song's got me feeling like that 

I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love 
Yeah, you know your song's got me feeling like that 
No fear but I think I'm falling 
I'm not proud 
But I'm usually the type of girl that would hit and run 
No risk so I think I'm falling 
When I kiss your lips, through my heartbeat thumb 

And now we're way up, dancing on the roof of the house 
And then we make love, right there on your best friend's couch 
And then you say "love, this is what is all about" 
So keep on kissing my mouth and put that record on again 

I don't want to hear sad songs anymore 
I only want to hear love songs 
I found my heart up in this place tonight 
Don't want to sing mad songs anymore 
Only want to sing your song 
Cause your song's got me feeling like that 

I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love 
I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love 
I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love 
Yeah, you know your song's got me feeling like that 

I don't want to hear sad songs anymore 
I only want to hear love songs 
I found my heart up in this place tonight 
Don't want to sing mad songs anymore 
Only want to sing your song 
Cause your song's got me feeling like that 

I don't want to hear sad songs anymore 
I only want to hear love songs 
I found my heart up in this place tonight 
Don't want to sing mad songs anymore 
Only want to sing your song 
Cause your song's got me feeling like that 

I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love 
I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love 
I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love 
Yeah, you know your song's got me feeling like that
