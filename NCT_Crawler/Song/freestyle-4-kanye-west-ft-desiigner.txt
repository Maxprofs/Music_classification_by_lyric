[Intro: Kanye West]
This that rap god *** nigga
I rip every one of these mother***ers down
Aye, rah, rah, rah
Rah, rah

[Verse: Kanye West]
Close eyes, see things
Fire up, tweaking
You in my freak dreams
You in my freak dreams
Bad bitch, you dig that
Get stacks, drive cars
Whip out, bitch out
Tits out, oh ***
My dick out, can she suck it right now?
***, can she *** right now?
I done asked twice now
Can you bring your price down?
Lil Boosie with the wipe down
A little woozy but I'm nice now
What the *** right now?
What the *** right now?
What the, what the *** right now?
What if we *** right now?
What if we ***ed right in the middle
Of this mother***in' dinner table?
What if we just ***ed at the Vogue party
Would we be the life of the whole party?
Shut down the whole party
Would everybody start ***in'?
Would everybody start ***in'?
Would everybody start ***in'? They don't want nothin'
You mother***ers living like half of your level, half of your life
I smack her on her ass if she ghetto, I ain't gon' lie
We be in the bathroom ***ing like baby don't get too loud
I can, I can sing it, yeah

[Hook: Desiigner]
I want it right now
All of my niggas gon' get it in Chi now
You get hit with the pie now
Rolls with killer money nigga get by now
Right now, right now
I'm with niggas that have been to your side now
Side now, side down
