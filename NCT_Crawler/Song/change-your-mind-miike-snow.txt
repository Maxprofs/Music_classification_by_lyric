                        Bài hát: Change Your Mind - Miike Snow

[Verse 1]
Early in the morning, up and fly away
You know why you don't walk here round the sun, no, my face
Couldn't get back to celebrate
And I know you're backing off, you want it both ways

[Pre-Chorus]
At night, I'm trading, gold diamonds for stars
Blinded by fire, showing me who you are
*** it, fade away, child 'til another day, child
Gotta keep my state of mind

[Chorus]
Maybe I have to wait a while
Maybe I have to wait a while
Maybe I could change your mind
Maybe I could change your mind, woah, oh

[Verse 2]
Step into the backroom, take your breath away
Even though it's been some time, you still love my taste
Trying to meet your eyes, I keep my sanity
Though I know you're backing off, you want it both ways

[Pre-Chorus]
At night, I'm trading, gold diamonds for stars
Blinded by fire, showing me who you are
*** it, fade away, child 'til another day, child
Gotta keep my state of mind

[Chorus]
Maybe I have to wait a while
Maybe I have to wait a while
Maybe I could change your mind
Maybe I could change your mind, woah, oh

[Outro]
I could feel the waves from you and I
Slamming on shore on the other side
But I have to wait 'til it's time
Fly away, fly away
I could feel the waves from you and I
Slamming on shore on the other side
But I have to wait 'til it's time
Fly away, fly away
I could feel the waves from you and I
Slamming on shore on the other side
But I have to wait 'til it's time
Fly away, fly away
Oh, I could feel the waves from you and I
Slamming on shore on the other side
But I have to wait 'til it's time, oh, oh, oh, oh
Fly away, fly away
                        
                    |
