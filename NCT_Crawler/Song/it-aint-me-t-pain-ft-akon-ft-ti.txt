                        Yeah, yeah, aye, this for all my cats, man
 Have you ever been in a club and have a chick run up on you
 And kinda tell you to buy her a drink, homie?
 I mean, it ain't what I can do, it what I will do And attitude is everythin', you know what I'm sayin'?
 I mean, a chick who ask for nothin' will get everythin'
 A chick who ask for everythin' will get nothin'
 Pain, why don't you talk to these motherfuckin'
 Broke bitches for a minute, would you? You may want a man with some consideration
 Determination, a little conversation, how you doin', baby?
 And you might want a man who just say straight I'm nasty
 From Tallahassee, it's a 850, you're far too classy So you might want a man
 Who's got a job, car, clothes, jewelry
 Girl, that just ain't foolin' me
 Do you know, do you know? Think that I'm that easy, shawty
 It can't go that breezy, shawty
 Find another dude 'cause it ain't me Put you in a range, buy you expensive things
 It ain't me, babe, it ain't me, no, it ain't me
 No way, no how, ah, ah
 It ain't me, babe, it ain't me, no, it ain't me Ice out all your fingers, take you out and make you famous
 It ain't me, babe, it ain't me, no, it ain't me
 No way, no how, ah, ah
 It ain't me, babe, it ain't me, no, it ain't me I know you thought you had a sugar daddy
 Plan to treat me like a her
 Take my money 'cause I'm attractive
 Then kick me off to the curve Dine in fancy restaurants
 Eating expensive hors d'oeuvres
 How I'm gonna let you get it all like that
 Without the big lip, girl that's my word? And if you wanna ride
 Then I just can't let it slide
 If you plan to get me for all I got
 You could start by spendin' the night Otherwise let me see your head get small
 Unless you're here to make the head get tall
 If not gon' get lost 'cause that ain't me Put you in a range, buy you expensive things
 It ain't me, babe, it ain't me, no, it ain't me
 No way, no how
 It ain't me, babe, it ain't me, no, it ain't me Ice out all your fingers, take you out and make you famous
 It ain't me, babe, it ain't me, no, it ain't me
 No way, no how, ah, ah
 It ain't me, babe, it ain't me, no, it ain't me Hey, shawty, look so good
 So she think I should
 Throw dough to her, like it ain't nothin' to it
 Get you whatever you like, I could But all I be givin' you tonight is this wood
 Hood, to my heart I do it
 Huge and your attitude just blew it
 So rude that your mentality is distortin' your reality Actually the more you speak
 Make me think where I'd rather be
 I don't care if you hiding me
 'Cause I won't sponsor shoppin' sprees It's lots of freaks that I could be
 Showin' my generosity
 To, boo, stop it please, I ain't that guy
 You ain't that fly Got your head up your ass that's why
 All you ask for is all I deny
 I do for you what I decide
 And I can buy all kinds of things Go places spend all kinds of dough
 My kindness is no blindness though
 T-Pain, where you find this hoe?
 I know what you want me to do Put you in a range, buy you expensive things
 It ain't me, babe, it ain't me, no, it ain't me
 No way, no how, ah, ah
 It ain't me, babe, it ain't me, no, it ain't me Ice out all your fingers, take you out and make you famous
 It ain't me, babe, it ain't me, no, it ain't me
 No way, no how, ah, ah
 It ain't me, babe, it ain't me, no, it ain't me
