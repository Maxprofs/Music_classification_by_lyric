                        Bài hát: Devil's Paradise - Inna

No I don't know
Know where you came
You came from bad
If you like
You can be my inspiration
In the day time, or red eye
Cause baby you shine like platinum ring
And if you want mine
I will show you off
And if you like to be held
I can hold you till the end of time

Cause you are the thing I need to do
Now I'm craving you cause you make all my wrongs feel right
Like a devil's paradise
You, I'm a little scared of you
Yeah I want you now now 'cause your lips are the perfect crime
Like a devil's paradise

You take all my flaws and make them priceless diamonds
I bet you're, you're an angel undercover
And I like it, yeah I'm sure
Cause baby you shine like platinum ring
And if you want mine
I will show you off
And if you like to be held
I can hold you till the end of time

Cause you are the thing I need to do
Now I'm craving you cause you make all my wrongs feel right
Like a devil's paradise
You, I'm a little scared of you
Yeah I want you now now 'cause your lips are the perfect crime
Like a devil's paradise
