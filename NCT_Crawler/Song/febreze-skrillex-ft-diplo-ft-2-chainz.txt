[Hook - 2 Chainz:]

Yeah, yeah, I'm the ***
Yeah, yeah, I'm the ***
Yeah, yeah, I'm the ***
Yeah, yeah, I'm the ***
Yeah, yeah, I'm the ***
Yeah, yeah, I'm the ***
I should have Febreze on me

[2 Chainz:]
I got two L's like Pelle, clip ya like LA, Lake'em
ISIL, I'mma bring home the bacon
You ain't from Kingston, you are Ja-faking
You take her and make up, I mess up her makeup
She started with an A-cup, put some D's on it
Yeah, I'm the ***, I should have Febreze on me
Take her back street and I put some P's on it
Just left the Gucci store, all I got is G's on me

[Hook]

[2 Chainz:]
My slangatory self-explanatory
Have my man step your mans, man got you mandatory
Tell her lift it in her ankle for me
Real niggas in danger, need a *** container
When I open it up, I can't *** contain it
I've got ten toes on the pavement so why you *** complaining?
Watch mad at my bracelet, my bracelet mad at my chain
Chain mad at my pinky so I can't wear no earrings, 2 Chainz

[2 Chainz:]
Yeah, I'm the ***
I should have Febreze on me
