                        [Keyshia talking]
I know you scared baby, 
but you gotta give me everything.

[Verse 1]
Let me be the one who can take you from all the things you see
and if you trust in me i can be that through anything you need (anything you need)
And give it all to me baby
dont you run from me baby
i'll give you every little piece of me
no i wont leave out a thing cause i know...

[Chorus]
I know u've seen alot of things in your life
got you feeling like this cant be right
but i wont hurt you im down for you baby
(i know u've seen alot of things) I know u've seen alot of things in your life
got you feeling like this cant be right
but i wont hurt you im down for you baby (im down for you baby)

[Verse 2]
Let me show you love can be easy if you just let it be (if you let be)
Nothing is promised but i believe if
If i give it everything
I 'll give you everything i've got
i'll wont stop until you get it right

[Repeat Chorus]
