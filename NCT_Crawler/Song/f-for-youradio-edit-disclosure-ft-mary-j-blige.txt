I've been infected with restless whispers and cheats
They're manifested in words and the lies that you speak
[x4]

Because I played the fool for ya
Because I played the fool for you
Because I played the fool for ya
Because I played the fool for you
Because I
Because I
Because I
Because I

Boy, your love is so beautiful
And I'll play the fool for you
Boy, your love is so beautiful
And I'll play the fool for you, babe
It makes me feel so good when you hold me tight
Always want it back
You make everything alright!
Boy, your love is so beautiful
I'll play, I'll play, I'll play the fool for you

Because I played the fool for ya
Because I played the fool for you
Because I played the fool for ya
Because I played the fool for you
Because I
Because I
Because I
Because I

Boy, your love's got me in a daze
And I'll do anything you say
Boy, your love's got me in a daze
And I'll do anything you say, baby
You give me what I need (what I need)
(Whenever you're around) You're the one
You'll always be my king, can't nobody take your crown
Boy, your love is so beautiful
I'll play, I'll play, I'll play the fool for you

Because I played the fool for ya
Because I played the fool for you
Because I played the fool for ya
Because I played the fool for you

Because I played the fool for ya
Because I played the fool for you
Because I played the fool for ya
Because I played the fool for you

I'll play, I'll play
I'll play the fool, for you babe
I'll play

Because I played the fool for ya
Because I played the fool for you
Because I played the fool for ya
Because I played the fool for you

I'll play, I'll play, I'll play
I'll play, I'll play, I'll play
I'll play, I'll play, I'll play
I'll play, baby

I've been infected with restless whispers and cheats
They're manifested in words and the lies that you speak
