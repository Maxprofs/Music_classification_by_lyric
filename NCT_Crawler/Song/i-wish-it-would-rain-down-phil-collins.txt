                        Bài hát: I Wish It Would Rain Down - Phil Collins

You know I never meant to see you again,
But I only passed by as a friend. (Yeah)
All this time I stayed out of sight,
I started wondering why.

Now I, ooh, now I wish it would rain down, down on me.
Ooh, yes, I wish it would rain, rain down on me now
Ooh, yes, I wish it would rain down, down on me.
Ooh, yes, I wish it would rain on me...

You said you didn't need me in your life
Oh, I guess you were right (Yeah)
Ooh, I never meant to cause you no pain,
But it looks like I did it again. (Yeah)

Now I,
Now I know I wish it would rain now, down on me
Ooh, yes I wish it would rain, rain down on me now
Ooh, girl I wish it would rain down, down on me
Ooh, yes I wish it would rain on me ...

Though your hurt is gone, mine's hanging on inside
And I know, it's eating me through,
It's eating me through every night and day
I'm just waiting on your sign.

'Cause I know,
I know,
I never meant to cause you no pain
And I realize I let you down (Oh)
But I know in my heart of hearts,
I know I'm never gonna hold you again, no.

Now I, now I know I wish it would rain down, down on me.
Ooh, you know I wish it would rain, rain down on me now.
Ooh, yes, I wish it would rain now, down on me.
Yes, you know I wish it would rain down, rain down over me ...

Just rain down over me.

Just let it rain down ...
Let it rain down
Let it rain down (Oh)

Let it rain down
Rain down over me.

Just let it rain down
Just let it rain down
Let it rain down.

Just let it rain ...
