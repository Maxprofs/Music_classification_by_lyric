                        AND AS I LOOK INTO YOUR EYES
I SEE AN ANGEL IN DISGUISE
SENT FROM GOD ABOVE
FOR ME TO LOVE
TO HOLD AND IDOLISE

AND AS I HOLD YOUR BODY NEAR
I'LL SEE THIS MONTH THROUGH TO A YEAR
AND THEN FOREVER ON
TIL LIFE IS GONE
I'LL KEEP YOUR LOVING NEAR

AND NOW I'VE FINALLY FOUND MY WAY
TO LEAD ME DOWN THIS LONELY ROAD
ALL I HAVE TO DO
IS FOLLOW YOU
TO LIGHTEN OFF MY LOAD

YOU TREAT ME LIKE A ROSE
YOU GIVE ME ROOM TO GROW
YOU SHONE THE LIGHT OF LOVE ON ME
AND GAVE ME AIR SO I CAN BREATHE
YOU OPEN DOORS THAT CLOSE
IN A WORLD WHERE ANYTHING GOES
YOU GIVE ME STRENGTH SO I STAND TALL
JUST LIKE A ROSE

AND WHEN I FEEL LIKE HOPE IS GONE
YOU GIVE ME STRENGTH TO CARRY ON
EACH TIME I LOOK AT YOU
THERE'S SOMETHING NEW
TO KEEP OUR LOVING STRONG

I HEAR YOU WHISPER IN MY EAR
ALL OF THE WORDS I LONG TO HEAR
OF HOW YOU'LL ALWAYS BE
HERE NEXT TO ME
TO WIPE AWAY MY TEARS

AND NOW I'VE FINALLY FOUND MY WAY
TO LEAD ME DOWN THIS LONELY ROAD
ALL I HAVE TO DO
IS FOLLOW YOU
TO LIGHTEN OFF MY LOAD

YOU TREAT ME LIKE A ROSE
YOU GIVE ME ROOM TO GROW
YOU SHONE THE LIGHT OF LOVE ON ME
AND GAVE ME AIR SO I CAN BREATHE
YOU OPENED DOORS I CLOSED
IN A WORLD WHERE ANYTHING GOES
YOU GIVE ME STRENGTH SO I STAND TALL
WITHIN THIS BED OF EARTH
JUST LIKE A ROSE

AND THOUGH THE SEASONS CHANGE
OUR LOVE REMAINS THE SAME
YOU FACE THE THUNDER
WHEN THE SUNSHINE TURNS TO RAIN
JUST LIKE A ROSE

YOU TREAT ME LIKE A ROSE
YOU GIVE ME ROOM TO GROW
YOU SHONE THE LIGHT OF LOVE ON ME
AND GAVE ME AIR SO I CAN BREATHE
YOU OPENED DOORS I CLOSED
IN A WORLD WHERE ANYTHING GOES
YOU GIVE ME STRENGTH SO I STAND TALL
WITHIN THIS BED OF EARTH
JUST LIKE A ROSE

YOU GIVE ME STRENGTH SO I STAND TALL
WITHIN THIS BED OF EARTH
JUST LIKE A ROSE
