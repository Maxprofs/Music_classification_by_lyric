                        Are you a man who loves
 And cherishes
 And cares for me?
 Is that true? Is that true?
 Is that true?
 Are you a guard in a prison
 Maximum security?
 Is that true? Is that true?
 Is that true?
 Do we stay home all the time
 Cuz you want me to yourself?
 Is that true? Is that true?
 Is that true?
 Or am I locked away
 Had a feeling that I'd find
 Someone else
 Is that true? Is that true?
 Is that true?

 [Chorus:]
 Well, I don't like
 Living under your spotlight
 Just because you think
 I might find somebody worthy
 Well, I don't like
 Living under your spotlight
 Baby, if you treat me right
 You won't have to worry

 Is this a relationship
 Fulfilling your needs
 As well as mine
 Is that true? Is that true?
 Is that true?
 Or is this just my sentence
 Am I doing time?
 Is that true? Is that true?
 Is that true?
 If this is love
 Real, real love
 Then I'm staying no doubt
 But if I'm just a prisoner
 Then I'm busting out
 Is that true? Is that true?
 Is that true?

 [Chorus:]

 Oh, you oughta be
 Ashamed of yourself
 What the hell
 Do you think you're doing?
 Loving me, loving me
 So wrong
 Baby, all I do is try
 (Try)
 To show you
 That you're my
 (My)
 One and only guy
 (Only guy)
 No matter
 Who may come along
 Open your eyes
 Cuz baby, I don't lie

 (Chorus 2x)
                        
                    |
