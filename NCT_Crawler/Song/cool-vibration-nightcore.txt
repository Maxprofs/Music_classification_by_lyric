                        Bài hát: Cool Vibration - Nightcore

Hear the voice's, who calling me
To feel the freedom, how it must be
Must remember, who I am
'Cause my soul, is rare jam
I have impression. 
This is cool vibration
I know you got it, together with me

Now we just try it. 
Drop it and not quiet
Don't stop the music, just party all night
Just party all night
Just party all night
Hear the voice's, who calling me
To feel the freedom, how it must be

Must remember, who I am
'Cause my soul, is rare jam
I have impression. 
This is cool vibration
I know you got it, together with me

Now we just try it. 
Drop it and not quiet
Don't stop the music, just party all night
Turn it up!
Just party all night
