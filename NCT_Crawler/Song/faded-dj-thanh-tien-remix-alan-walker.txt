                        Bài hát: Faded (DJ Thành Tiến Remix) - Alan Walker

You were the shadow to my light 
Did you feel us 
Another start 
You fade away 
Afraid our aim is out of sight 
Wanna see us 
Alight 

Where are you now(3) 
Was it all in my fantasy 
Where are you now 
Were you only imaginary 

Where are you now 
Atlantis 
Under the sea(2) 
Where are you now 
Another dream 
The monster running wild inside of me 
I'm faded(2) 
(So lost, (I'm faded)2)2 

These shallow waters, never met 
What i needed 
I'm letting go 
A deeper dirve 
Enter nal silence of the sea 
I'm breathing 
Alive 
Where are you now(2) 
Under the bright 
But faded lights 
You set my heart on fire 

Where are you now(3) 
Atlantis 
Under the sea(2) 
Where are you now 
Another dream 
The monster running wild inside of me 
I'm faded(2) 
(So lost, I'm faded2)2
                        
                    |
