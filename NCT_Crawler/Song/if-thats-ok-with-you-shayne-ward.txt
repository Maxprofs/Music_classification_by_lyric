                        If That's Ok With You
[Verse 1]
I love the way that you look without your make-up
I had a girl before we met but we broke up
There's something about you that makes me want to step up
Step up and be with you
If that's OK with you
We'll keep the neighbours awake too late, too late
'cause I'm gonna make you feel so good how I see it's happening
We'll keep the neighbours awake too late, too late
'cause baby I wanna step up and be with you
If that's OK with you

[Chorus]
I'm gonna make you feel like you are heaven on earth
I'm gonna saint your mother just for giving you birth
I'm gonna wanna hold you in my arms when you cry
If that's OK with you
If that's OK with you

[Verse 2]
I wanna keep your toothbrush at my apartment
Make a second set of keys and ask you to move in
I'm not crazy
I know what I'm getting myself in
I wanna live with you
If that's OK with you

[Chorus x2]
I'm gonna make you feel like you are heaven on earth
I'm gonna saint your mother just for giving you birth
I'm gonna wanna hold you in my arms when you cry
If that's OK with you
If that's OK with you
If that's OK with you
If that's OK with you
Yeah, yeah

[Verse 3]
We'll keep the neighbours awake too late too late
I wanna love you this way that way this way
We'll keep the neighbours away too late too late
I wanna love you this way that way this way

[Chorus x2]
                        
                    |
