                        Bài hát: Dawn Of Us - Jackson (GOT7)

[Chorus]
Let it come, ooh
Let it come, ooh
Starting brand new chapter from today at dawn, yeah
We gon' make it, I know our sun won't go down, yeah
Let it come, ooh
Let it come, ooh
Starting brand new chapter from today at dawn, yeah
We gon' make it, I know our sun won't go down, yeah

[Verse 1]
Keep that addicting smile that you have
You're my own, no doubt for sure, I mean what I said
Girl, into you now, into you now
Wish I could say these words to you beside a fireplace now
Hold up, just hold up baby, I ain't no filthy player
You be the Mara Jade, I'll be your Skywalker
Every perspective of yours is like a magazine cover
Hope one day the person I give my ring to is you
Girl, we gon', we gon', we gon' gon' reach the paradise
We are, we know, for you, yeah I will sacrifice
Girl, we gon', we gon', we gon' gon' reach the paradise
We are, we know, for you, yeah I will sacrifice

[Chorus]
Let it come, ooh
Let it come, ooh
Starting brand new chapter from today at dawn, yeah
We gon' make it, I know our sun won't go down, yeah
Let it come, ooh
Let it come, ooh
Starting brand new chapter from today at dawn, yeah
We gon' make it, I know our sun won't go down, yeah

[Verse 3]
Get it on my ride, get on my ride, sit back and hold on tight
Feeling my vibe, feeling my vibe, I see you in my sight
If you the sun, then I hope to be the planets surrounding you
Taking selfies with the satellites while I'm with you
Romeo and Juliet but we don't have to split apart
Gonna hit the bulls eye anyway, believe and throw the dart
I cross the amazon, let me bring you back to a brand new journey
Started from day one, already I'm packed, leave it all down to me
Girl, we gon', we gon', we gon' gon' reach the paradise
We are, we know, for you, yeah I will sacrifice
Girl, we gon', we gon', we gon' gon' reach the paradise
We are, we know, for you, yeah I will sacrifice

[Chorus]
Let it come, ooh
Let it come, ooh
Starting brand new chapter from today at dawn, yeah
We gon' make it, I know our sun won't go down, yeah
Let it come, ooh
Let it come, ooh
Starting brand new chapter from today at dawn, yeah
We gon' make it, I know our sun won't go down, yeah
