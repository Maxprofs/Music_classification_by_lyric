                        Stay, I wanna be your man
Please, stay
You need a helping hand
Tonight I'm falling in love
Stay, I love your Chinese eyes
Please, stay
Cause you're a big surprise
Tonight, I'm fallin' in love

Oh, lady Lai
The time when you touch me
I love you till eternity
Oh ever I'll be your loving guide
Be here tonight
Oh, lady Lai
Oh, please come stay with me
By the light of the magical moon
Later or soon, I'll be your guide
Be here tonight

Hey, you're like a butterfly
Oh stay, oh give my love a try
Tonight, I'm fallin' in love
Stay, I wanna be your man
I feel, I'll never feel again
Tonight, I'm fallin' in love
                        
                    |
