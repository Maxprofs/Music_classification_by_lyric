                        I wrestle with my thoughts at night
 Anchored to the ropes I tied myself
 Mhmm
 Heaviness in both my legs
 Like I walked a thousand miles a day
 Mhmm If I could stand on top of my world
 I'd still be looking up
 At stars that I can never touch When a sky full of tears falls to the earth
 I gotta believe we're healing now
 Now before you give up, before it gets worse
 I have to believe we're healing now From where I stand it's hard to see
 What anyone has to offer me today
 Mhmm
 Courage comes from letting go
 And loving everything you fear away
 Oh I dream about war
 I live without peace
 A cell without bars
 Free air I can't breathe
 I choose to believe
 In the face of my doubts
 I am what I see
 I am healing now
                        
                    |
