                        Bài hát: Not In Love - Enrique Iglesias 

You call me on the phone
I act like nothing's going on
We're driving in my car
I pretend that you don't turn me on
You sexy thing yeah you know it (yeah)
You move around yeah you show it
I'm not in love
It's just the phase I'm going thru
I'm always looking for something new
But don't go running away
It's almost 3am
I'm hoping that you don't let go
Your moving in so close
I'm trying not to lose control
You sexy thing yeah you know it
I try to tell myself all the time
I just can't help how I feel tonight
So don't go running away
I'm not in love (yeah)
I'm not in love (give it to me)
I'm not in love (break it down)
