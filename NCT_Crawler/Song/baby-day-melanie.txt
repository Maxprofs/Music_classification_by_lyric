                        Da da da da da da, da da da da da da

 Why sleep when the day has been called out by the sun
 From the night 'cause the light's gonna shine on everyone
 Why sleep when the sleep only closes up our eyes
 Why sleep when we can watch the sun a-rise

 We were meant to see the beginning of the day
 I believe it was planned to lift us this way
 Take you an apple and take you a song
 And watch a baby day be born
 Take you an apple and take you a song
 Watch a baby day be born

 Quite quite, said I that's all very well to say
 But I rose before the dawn to your singing yesterday
 I couldn't see the rising 'cause the dark was in my sky
 I couldn't see the sun 'cause the sun was in my eye

 Take you an apple and take you a song
 Watch a baby day be born
 Take you an apple and take you a song
 Watch a baby day be born

 Why sleep, I heard and I followed it today
 To the top of the hill where the wind songs play
 And I sing it like I heard it
 Why I heard it who knows why?
 Why sleep when we can watch the sun a-rise

 We were meant to see the beginning of the day
 I believe it was planned to lift us this way
 Take you an apple and take you a song
 Watch a baby day be born
 Take you an apple and take you a song
 Watch a baby day be born
 Take you an apple and take you a song
 Watch a baby day be born
 Take you an apple and take you a song
 Watch a baby day be born

 Take you an apple and take you a song
 Take back an answer to something gone wrong
 Take back some music and take me along
 And watch a baby day be born
 Watch a baby day be born
