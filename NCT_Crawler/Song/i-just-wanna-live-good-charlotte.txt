                        I need an a-larm system in my house
So I know when people are
Creeping about
These people are
Freaking me out
(these days)
It's getting hectic everywhere that I go
They won't leave me alone
There's things they all wanna know
I'm paranoid off all the people I meet
Why are they talking to me?
And why can't anyone see
I just wanna live
Don't really care about the things that they say
Don't really care about what happens to me
I just wanna live
Just wanna live [x6]
I rock a
Lawsuit when I'm going to court
A white suit when I'm gettin' divorced
A black suit at the funeral home
And my birthday suit when I'm home alone
Talkin' on the phone
Got an interview
With the rolling stone
They're saying
“Now you're rich and
Now you're famous
fake ass girls all know your names and
Lifestyles of the rich and famous
your first hit aren't you a-shamed?”
Of the life [x2]
Of the life you're livin'
I just wanna live
Don't really care about the things that they say
Don't really care about what happens to me
I just wanna live
Stop your messin' around boy
Better think a your future
Better make some good plans boy
Said everyone of my teachers
Lookout
You better play it safe
You never know what hard times will come your way
We say
Where we're coming from
We've already seen
The worst that this life can bring
Now we're expected everywhere that we go
All the things that they say
Yeah we already know
I just wanna live
Don't really care about the things that they say
Don't really care about what happens to me
Just wanna live [x3]
I just wanna live
Just wanna live [x3]
I just wanna live
Just wanna live [x3]
Don't really care about the things that they say
Just wanna live [x3]
Don't really care about what happens to me
I just wanna live
