                        Bound to your side, I'm trapped in silence
 Just a possession
 Is it sex or only violence
 That feeds your obsession

You send me to a broken state
 Where I can take the pain just long enough
 Then I am numb
 Then I just disappear

So go on, infect me
 Go on and scare me to death
 Tell me I asked for it
 Tell me I'll never forget
 You could give me anything but love
 Anything but love

Does it feel good to deny
 Hurt me with nothing
 Some sort of sick satisfaction
 You get from my *

Oh stripped down to my naked core
 The darkest corners of my mind are yours
 That's where you live
 That's where you breathe

So go on, infect me
 Go on and scare me to death
 Dare me to leave you
 Tell me I'd never forget
 You could give me anything but love
 Anything but love

Without any faith
 Without any light
 Condemn me to live
 Condemn me to lie
 Inside I am dead

So go on, infect me
 Go on and scare me to death
 I'll be the victim
 You'll be the voice in my head
 You could give me anything but love
 Anything but love
 Anything but love
 Anything but love
 Anything but love
 Anything but love
