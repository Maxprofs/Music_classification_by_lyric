                        Bài hát: 24/7 - The Neighbourhood

[Verse 1]
Daddy's little girl started growing up (up, up, up, up)
She left the suburbs in the summer 'cause she fell in love (love, love, love)
Temperature's 101, uh, in the 405
Right around 6:15 and she's gotta be back by nine
Honey's just 22 and she doesn't know what to do
So I tell her "don't cry, can't worry 'bout time"

[Chorus]
You can't worry 'bout time
And you can hit my line like 24/7, 24/7, 24/7
I'll be there to listen anytime
I'll be there to listen anytime

[Verse 2]
Mama's baby boy started blowin' up (up, up, up, up)
Left his hometown, didn't slow down 'cause he never fell far enough
Headed out on PCH, mm (oh, yeah)
Doing 58, (oh, yeah) doesn't want to be too late (alright)
So he's switching lanes
But he's just 25 (hey!)
And he got his money, right?
So I told him "don't rush, just give it some time" (ohh)

[Chorus]
Just give it some time (ooo)
You can hit my line like 24/7, 24/7, 24/7
I'll be there to listen anytime

[Bridge]
I know what it means to ya
Any time, all day, every week, for ya
I'll be there to listen and believe in ya
It's the same thing that I really need from ya

[Outro]
Time, we only get so much time
And you can hit my line like 24/7, 24/7, 24/7
I'll be there to listen anytime
24/7, 24/7, 24/7
I'll be there to listen anytime
I'll be there to listen anytime
