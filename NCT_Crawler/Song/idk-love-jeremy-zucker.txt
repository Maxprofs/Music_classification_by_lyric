                        Bài hát: Idk Love - Jeremy Zucker

[Intro]
With the summer sun over us
I never thought that I could feel this, blind
Remembering how I would give a ***
Stressing out because I wanted, time
Now I'm pouring out an hourglass
Waiting for the wind to carry me
I wish the sun would go and hide away
Cause I've just been dying for rain
And lately I don't feel the same
Though I've been trying to

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't know love no more
I don't know love no more
It's easier when you know
You'll be fine on your own

[Chorus]
But I don't know love no more
I don't know love no more
You say that you know this road
But you don't know difficult

[Verse 1]
You will call me when you need it, call it when it's convenient for ya
You don't know the way, you control me
Act like you don't see it, spill a ocean of secrets and ya
Hold me down and hope, I won't drown till

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't know love no more
And I don't know love no more
It's easier cuz I know
I’ll be fine on my own

[Chorus]
But I don't know love no more
I don't know love no more
You say that you know this road
But you don't know difficult

[Outro]
I don't know love
I don't know love
I don't know love
                        
                    |
