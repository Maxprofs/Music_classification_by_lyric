Album:Jordin Sparks

Hold the pose
A perfect picture
Just so i remember how you lookin like tonight
Let it go,now the days gone,
Standing in the dark and we turn on the lights
Tonight we will deny
That time is passing by
It's leaving you and I too
freeze...
the moment,
its never been better
freeze...
all over
we won't last forever
you said that you're sorry
for pushing me, but then smiled when i opened my eyes
im gonna freeze the moment while we're together
Keep the peace
Bygones be gone
coming out the rain under the light that weve made
under here, were not so soft
forgiving the feelings that we put up the rain
Tonight we will deny
That time is passing by
It's leaving you and I too
freeze...
the moment,
its never been better
freeze...
all over
we won't last forever
you said that you're sorry
for pushing me, but then smiled when i opened my eyes
im gonna freeze the moment while we're together
Dont stop gotta know what you got
theres not second chances in life,
dont break it, gotta give what you take
when you....
freeze...
the moment,
its never been better
freeze...
all over
we won't last forever
freeze...
the moment,
its never been better
freeze...
all over
we won't last forever
you looked at me
with the truth in your eyes
and you said its okay you can go
i'm gonna
freeze...
this moment,
while we're together
freeze the moment.
