                        Bài hát: Back On The Wall - Greyson Chance

[Verse 1]
I'm wild somedays but I'm loyal, baby
I know you think I'm coming undone
But there's no need, no need to be afraid

[Pre-Chorus]
Just let it go for a minute
If you're feeling cold, let it hit ya
We want to feel emotion so let's feel it

[Chorus]
Cause when the night falls, your love puts me back on the wall
Cause your love, your love, your love puts me back on the wall
Cause when the night falls, your love puts me back on the wall
Cause your love, your love, your love puts me back on the wall
Puts me back on the wall

[Verse 2]
You're intoxicating but you're so damn complicated
I want to see you coming undone
After all this time that I've been waiting

[Pre-Chorus]
So just let it go for a minute
If you're feeling cold, let it hit ya
We want to feel emotion so let's feel it

[Chorus]
Cause when the night falls, your love puts me back on the wall
Cause your love, your love, your love puts me back on the wall
Cause when the night falls, your love puts me back on the wall
Cause your love, your love, your love puts me back on the wall
Puts me back on the wall

[Post-Chorus]
So just let it go for a minute
If you're feeling cold, let it hit ya
We want to feel emotion so let's feel it
Puts me back on the wall
Puts me back on the wall

[Bridge]
When darkness comes to you babe
You don't have to worry
I'mma be the one to stay, I'mma be the one to stay
When darkness comes to you babe
You don't have to worry
I'mma be the one to stay

[Chorus]
Cause when the night falls, your love puts me back on the wall
Cause your love, your love, your love puts me back on the wall
Cause when the night falls, your love puts me back on the wall
Cause your love, your love, your love puts me back on the wall
Puts me back on the wall

[Post-Chorus]
So just let it go for a minute
If you're feeling cold, let it hit ya
We want to feel emotion so let's feel it
Puts me back on the wall
Puts me back on the wall
                        
                    |
