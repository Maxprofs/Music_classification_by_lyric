                        Bài hát: Love Story - Mariah Carey

Hey baby, it won't end, won't end, won't end
Hey baby, it won't end, won't end, won't end
Hey baby, it won't end, won't end, won't end
Hey baby, it won't end, won't end, won't end
Hey baby, it won't end, won't end, won't end
Hey baby, it won't end, won't end, won't end
Hey baby, it won't end, won't end, won't end

This is my love story
Boy meets girl and looks in her eyes
Time stands still and two hearts catch fire
Off they go rollercoaster ride
Up & down and around
Twisted all out they minds

And then his friends
Said "it's too soon to settle down"
And then her friends Said "he's a playa, slow it down"
They couldn't be who they was
Cause it just seemed like love Wasn't on their side

But this isn't just another love story
Together we'll make history
I know because it's destiny
There'll be no end to our love story
And this ain't gon' end up
Like that Casablanca movie (no)
This ain't no fairy tale or fiction
This is truly
Ours for all eternity
There'll be no end to our love story, baby.

Hey baby, it won't end, won't end, won't end
Hey baby, it won't end, won't end, won't end
Hey baby, it won't end, won't end, won't end
Just no end to our love story...

Chapter two When they meet up again
Second time around
Say that they're just friends
But the feelings still strong
And it's been too long
To be trippin' like they ain't been missing
They on the phone like

Hey, baby
Let's meet up today
Gots 'bout an hour or two
You might as well come thru
We can make it like it was
Just the two of us
Back up on that rollercoaster
Like we been supposed to

Cause this isn't just another love story
Together we'll make history
I know because it's destiny
There'll be no end to our love story
And this ain't gon' end up
Like that Casablanca movie (no)
This ain't no fairy tale or fiction
This is truly
Ours for all eternity
There'll be no end to our love story, baby.

Just when it seemed
Like all the odds were stacked against them
They came back stronger than before
Matter fact then some
Stronger than pride
Lookin' like them
Lookin' like her, lookin' like him
Stronger than hate
And the whole world too
Lookin' like me
Lookin' like you

Cause this isn't just another love story
Together we'll make history
I know because it's destiny
There'll be no end to our love story
And this ain't gon' end up
Like that Casablanca movie (no)
This ain't no fairy tale or fiction
This is truly
Ours for all eternity
There'll be no end to our love story, baby.

Hey baby, it won't end, won't end, won't end
Hey baby, it won't end, won't end, won't end
Hey baby, it won't end, won't end, won't end
