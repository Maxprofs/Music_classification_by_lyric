                        Oh, oh yeah
 Baby, I'm high, high on the love we make
 That's what you do for me
 Baby, I'm high, high on the love we make
 Baby, I'm high on you Been a long time down
 Lookin' at the ground and feelin' bad
 Heaven knows I've tried
 But the pain inside just made me sad When you're looking back at yesterday
 And find you can't let go
 You need someone who can lift you up
 To get ready for tomorrow Baby, I'm high, high on the love we make
 That's what you do for me
 Baby, I'm high, I am in ecstasy
 Boy, what you doing to me
 'Cos baby, I'm high, high on the love we make
 Baby, I'm high on you Took me by surprise
 When I saw the passion in your eyes
 Now I've got you here
 Life is good and I feel satisfied Now I'm flying with the birds above
 I'm floating to the moon
 Got the clouds to walk on every day
 And the stars shine when you walk in the room Now I'm high, high on the love we make
 That's what you do for me
 Baby, I'm high, I am in ecstasy
 Boy, what you doing to me
 'Cos baby, I'm high, high on the love we make
 That's what you do for me Baby, ya makin' me high, high on the love we make
 Baby, I'm high on you
 Baby, I'm high on your kiss
 Now I'm addicted to you
 I don't want to get over this
 Oh yeah, baby, I'm high on you You need someone who can lift you up
 To get ready for tomorrow Baby, I'm high enough on what you do
 You make me feel so high on you
 I'm high, so high, so high Baby, I'm high enough on what you do
 You make me feel so high on you
 I'm high, so high, so high Baby, I'm high enough on what you do
 You make me feel so high on you
 I'm high Baby, I'm high enough on what you do
 You make me feel so high on you
 I'm high Baby, I'm high enough on what you do
 You make me feel so high on you
 I'm high, so high Baby, I'm high enough on what you do
 You make me feel so high on you
 I'm high
