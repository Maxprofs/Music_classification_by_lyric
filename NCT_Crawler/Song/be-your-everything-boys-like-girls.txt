                        Four letter word
But I don't have the guts to say it
Smile til it hurts
Lets not make it complicated
We've got a story
But I'm about to change the ending
You're perfect for me
You're more than just a friend so we can just stop pretending now
I gotta let you know somehow

I'll be your shelter
I'll be your storm
I'll make you shiver
I'll keep you warm
Whatever weather
Baby I'm yours
I'll be your forever, be your fling
Baby I will be your everything

We used to say
That we would always stay together
But who's to say
We could never last forever
Girl, got a question
Could you see yourself with somebody else?
'Cause I'm on a mission
And I don't wanna share I want you all to myself right now
I just wanna scream it out

I'll be your shelter
I'll be your storm
I'll make you shiver
I'll keep you warm
Whatever weather
Well baby I'm yours
I'll be your forever, be your fling
Baby I will be your everything

No matter what you do
I'll be there for you
Every time you close your eyes
I will be by your side
Just this time you make me sing

I'll be your shelter
I'll be your storm
I'll make you shiver
I'll keep you warm
Whatever weather
Baby I'm yours
I'll be your forever, be your fling

Baby I will be your everything
Baby I will
Baby I will
Baby I will be your everything

Baby I will be your everything
