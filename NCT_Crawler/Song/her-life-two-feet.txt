                        Bài hát: Her Life - Two Feet

Everyday she sees her life 
Face away and pass her by 
What can she do 
What can she do 

Wants to leave her lonely 
Wants to go and *** around 
What can she do 
What can she do 

It's her life 
It's her life 
It's her life 
It's her life 

Wants to quit all of her jobs 
Sell her house anh move along 
What can she do 
What can she do 

Lives in dreams and self-told lies 
She saw world through jaded eyes 
What can she do 
What can she do 

It's her life 
It's her life
                        
                    |
