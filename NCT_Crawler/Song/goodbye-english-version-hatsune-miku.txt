                        Bài hát: Goodbye (English Version) - Hatsune Miku

When I was little 
I was taught that the world wasn't my story 
All the tears I will cry 
Wouldn't even make up a sea 

Tell me how I'll be found 
Let it be known 
Tell me who will become still 
When I am shown 

And I'll be forgotten in time 
no matter how hard I try 
I'll be a wasted life 
So this is my goodbye 
Wake me when I 
have the courage to die 
Cause I'm too scared to try 
I am a wasted life 
So this is my goodbye 

I never wanted fame 
Cause when we are dead it's all the same 
Human mortality is a test on our memory 

Let me know when I'll go 
Will I be loved 
Will someone care I'm not there 
Am I enough 

And I'll be forgotten in time 
no matter how hard I try 
I'll be a wasted life 
So this is my goodbye 
Wake me when I 
have the courage to die 
Cause I'm too scared to try 
I am a wasted life 
So this is my goodbye 

So this is my goodbye 

I'll stop hoping stop wishing 
stop singing stop living 
Stop, I'll stop 

I'll stop moving stop breathing 
Stop thinking stop living 
Stop, Just stop 

And I'll be forgotten in time 
no matter how hard I try 
I'll be a wasted life 
So this is my goodbye 
Wake me when I 
have the courage to try 
Cause I'm too scared to try 
I am a wasted life 
So this is my goodbye
                        
                    |
