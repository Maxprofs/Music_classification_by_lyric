                        I made a sideways motion
 Turning a new leaf
 The single minded miner's girl
 Was there to share my grief
 I shivered in the butter wind
 Three times the cockerel crowed
 I waited for the river
 But the river did not flow.

 An autumn turned to silver
 Winter turned to gold
 The weatherman said dress up
 Oh but I did not feel the cold
 Kids waited with toboggans
 As I sheltered from the snow
 I waited for the river
 But the river did not flow.

 I will drink the milk from you breasts
 Meld myself to you
 Collect the valley lilies
 The worshippers once strew
 My body aches with hunger
 Yet your belly has to grow
 I waited for the river
 But the river did not flow.
                        
                    |
