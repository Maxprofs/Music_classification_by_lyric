                        TERRY JACKS - SEASONS IN THE SUN LYRICS

Goodbye to you, my trusted friend
 We've known each other since we were nine or ten
 Together we climbed hills and trees
 Learned of love and A B C's
 Skinned our hearts and skinned our knees


Goodbye, my friend, it's hard to die

When all the birds are singing in the sky

Now that the spring is in the air

Pretty girls are everywhere

Think of me and I'll be there


We had joy, we had fun

We had seasons in the sun

But the hills that we climbed were just seasons

Out of time


Goodbye Papa, please pray for me

I was the black sheep of the family

You tried to teach me right from wrong

Too much wine and too much song

Wonder how I got along


Goodbye Papa, itâ€™s hard to die

When all the birds are singing in the sky

Now that the spring is in the air

Little children everywhere

When you see them I'll be there


We had joy, we had fun

We had seasons in the sun

But the wine and the song like the seasons

Have all gone


We had joy, we had fun

We had seasons in the sun

But the wine and the song like the seasons

Have all gone


Goodbye Michelle, my little one

You gave me love and helped me find the sun

And every time that I was down

You would always come around

And get my feet back on the ground


Goodbye Michelle it's hard to die

When all the birds are singing in the sky

Now that the spring is in the air

With the flowers everywhere

I wish that we could both be there


We had joy, we had fun

We had seasons in the sun

But the stars we could reach

Were just starfish on the beach


We had joy, we had fun

We had seasons in the sun

But the stars we could reach

Were just starfish on the beach


We had joy we had fun

We had seasons in the sun

But the wine and the song like the seasons

Have all gone


All our lives we had fun

We had seasons in the sun

But the hills that we climbed were just seasons

Out of time


We had joy, we had fun

We had seasons in the sun
