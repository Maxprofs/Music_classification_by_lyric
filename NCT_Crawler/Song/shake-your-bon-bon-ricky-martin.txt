Ricky Martin - Shake Your Bon-Bon
 www.NhacCuaTui.com
I\'m a desperado
Underneath your window
I see your silhouette
Are you my Juliet
I feel a mad connection
With your body
Shake your bon-bon
Shake your bon-bon
Shake your bon-bon
I wanna be your lover
Your only latin lover
We\'ll go around the world in a day
Don\'t say no, no
Shake it my way, oh
Shake your bon-bon
Shake your bon-bon
Shake your bon-bon
You\'re a Mata Hari
I wanna know your story
In the Sahara sun
I wanna be the one
That\'s gonna come and take you, make you
Shake your bon-bon
Shake your bon-bon
Shake your bon-bon
Up in the Himalayas
C\'mon I wanna lay ya
We\'ll go around the world in a day
Don\'t say no, no
Shake it my way, oh
Shake your bon-bon
Shake your bon-bon
Shake your bon-bon
Hola Amiga, Hola Amiga
You\'re my temple of desire
Hola Amiga, Hola Amiga
You\'re my temple of desire
We\'ll go around the world in a day
Don\'t say no, no
Shake it my way, oh
Shake your bon-bon
Shake your bon-bon
Shake your bon-bon
We\'ll go around the world in a day
Don\'t say no, no
Shake it my way, oh
Shake your bon-bon
Shake your bon-bon
Shake your bon-bon
I\'m a desperado
Underneath your window
I see your silhouette
Are you my Juliet
I feel a mad connection
With your body
Shake your bon-bon
Shake your bon-bon
Shake your bon-bon
I wanna be your lover
Your only latin lover
We\'ll go around the world in a day
Don\'t say no, no
Shake your bon-bon
Shake your bon-bon
