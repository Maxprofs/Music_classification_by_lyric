                        I'D LOVE TO KILL YOU

I'd love to kill you with a kiss
I'd like to strike you down with bliss
I'd like to tie you up in knots
until your heart stops

I'd love to kill you with a glance
I'd like to put you in trance
I'd like to drug you with my scent
And use you in the moment


I'd love to kill you as you eat
The pleasure would taste so sweet
I'd like to open up your skin
And wander there within

I'd love to kill you by a stream
Where no one can hear my baby scream
And then I'd run away and be free
The sweetest victory


I love to watch you in your sleep
Cause you don't have power over me
And when you're awake I'm undone
Under you spell, in hell
                        
                    |
