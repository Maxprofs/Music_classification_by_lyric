                        Bài hát: We Are Giants - Lindsey Stirling, Dia Frampton

Do you feel like you're second-hand?
Do you feel you're afraid to stand alone?
Cut away every safety net
Live your life so you won't regret the road

Feels like you, just standing there so small
Just the space between the stars
Don't be afraid to risk it all
Cause we are we are

We are giants
We are giant
We are giants
We are we are
We are giants
We are giant
We are giants
We are we are

Raise your flag; Let your voice be heard
Put your heart into every word you say
All your failures' a cornerstone
Build a house with the things you've thrown away

Feels like you, just standing there so small
Just the space between the stars
Don't be afraid to risk it all
Cause we are we are

We are giants
We are giant
We are giants
We are we are
We are giants
We are giant
We are giants
We are we are

Feels like you, just standing there so small
Just the space between the stars
Don't be afraid to risk it all
Cause we are we are

We are giants
We are giant
We are giants
We are we are
We are giants
We are giant
We are giants
We are we are
                        
                    |
