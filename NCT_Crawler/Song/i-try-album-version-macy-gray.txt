                        Games, changes and fears,
 When will they go from here?
 When will they stop?
 I believe that fate has brought us here
 And we should be together babe, but we're not
 I play it off but I'm dreaming of you
 And I'll keep my cool but I'm feelin'
 I try to say good-bye and I choke
 I try to walk away and I stumble
 Though I try to hide it, it's clear;
 My world crumbles when you are not near
 Good-bye and I choke
 I try to walk away and I stumble
 Though I try to hide it, it's clear;
 My world crumbles when you are not near

 I may appear to be free
 But I'm just a prisoner of your love
 And I may seem alright
 And smile when you leave
 But my smiles are just a front, just a front
 And I play it off but I'm dreaming of you
 And I'll keep my cool but I'm feelin'
 I try to say good-bye and I choke
 I try to walk away and I stumble
 Though I try to hide it, it's clear
 My world crumbles when you are not near
 Good-bye and I choke
 I try to walk away and I stumble
 Though I try to hide it, it's clear
 My world crumbles when you are not near

 Here is my confession, may I be your possession
 Boy I need your touch, your love kisses and such
 With all my might I try but this I can't deny, deny

 I play is off but I'm dreaming of you,
 But I'm dreaming of you babe
 I'll keep my cool but I'm feelin'
 I try to say good-bye and I choke
 I try to walk away and I stumble
 Though I try to hide it, it's clear
 My world crumbles when you are not near
 Good-bye and I choke
 I try to walk away and I stumble
 Though I try to hide it (Sent of love), it's clear
 My world crumbles when you are not near (Your love, kisses and such)
 I try to say good-bye and I choke (Good-bye and I'm choking)
 I try to walk away and I stumble
 Though I try to hide it, it's clear
 My world crumbles when you are not near
                        
                    |
