                        Title: Give In To Me
Artist: Three Days Grace 

She always takes it with a heart of stone
''Cause all she does is throw it back at me
I''ve spent a lifetime
Looking for someone
Don''t try to understand me
Simply do the things I say
.
Love is a feeling
Give it when I want it
''Cause I''m on fire
Quench my desire
Give it when I want it
Talk to me woman
Give in to me
Give in to me
.
You always knew just how to make me cry
And never did I ask you questions why
It seems you get your kicks from hurting me
Don''t try to understand me
Cause your words just aren''t enough
.
Love is a feeling
Quench my desire
Give it when I want it
Takin'' me higher
Love is a woman
I don''t wanna hear it
Give in to me
Give in to me
.
You and your friends
Were laughing at me in town
But it''s okay
It''s okay
You won''t be laughing girl
When I''m not around
I''ll be okay
I''m gonna find the peace of mind

.
Give in to me
Give in to me
.
Love is a feeling
Give it when I want it
''Cause I''m on fire
Quench my desire
Give it when I want it
Talk to me woman
Give in to me
Give in to me
.
Love is a feeling
Takin'' me higher
Give it when I want it
''Cause I''m on fire
Talk to me woman
Give it when I want it
Give in to me
Give in to me
