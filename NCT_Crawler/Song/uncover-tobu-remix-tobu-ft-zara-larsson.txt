                        Bài hát: Uncover (Tobu Remix) - Tobu, Zara Larsson

Nobody sees - Nobody knows 
We are a secret - can't be exposed 
That's how it is - That's how it goes 
Far from the others 
Close to each other 

In the daylight - in the daylight 
When the sun is shining 
On a late night, on a late night 
When the moon is blinding 
In the plain sight - Plain sight 
Like stars in hiding 
You and I burn on, on 

Put two and to-gether - forever 
We'll never change 
two and to-gether 
We'll never change 

Nobody sees - Nobody knows 
We are a secret - can't be exposed 
That's how it is - That's how it goes 
Far from the others 
Close to each other 
That's when we uncover, cover, cover. 
Thats what we uncover, cover, cover. 

My asylum - My asylum 
Is in your arms 
When the world gives heavy burdens 
I can bare a thousand tons 
On your shoulder - on your shoulder 
I can reach an endless sky 
Feels like paradise 

Put two and to-gether - forever 
We'll never change 
two and to-gether 
We'll never change 

Nobody sees - Nobody knows 
We are a secret - can't be exposed 
That's how it is - That's how it goes 
Far from the others 
Close to each other 
That's when we uncover, cover, cover. 
Thats what we uncover, cover, cover. 

We could build a universe right here 
All the world could disappear 
Wouldn't notice, wouldn't care 
We could build a universe right here 
The world could disappear 
Yeah, I just need you near 

Nobody sees - Nobody knows 
We are a secret - can't be exposed 
That's how it is - That's how it goes 
Far from the others 
Close to each other 
That's when we uncover, cover, cover. 
That's when we uncover, cover, cover. 

That's when we uncover.
