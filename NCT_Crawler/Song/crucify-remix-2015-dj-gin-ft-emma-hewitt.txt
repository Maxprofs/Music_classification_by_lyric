                        Bài hát: Crucify (Remix 2015) - DJ Gin, Emma Hewitt

On that day I took you up
It was now or never
And I savored all you were
On our road to nowhere

All you said was not enough
I could not wait forever
If I had stayed to hold you up
It would not make you better

I know your cool
But you won’t leave them
I know your cool
But you won’t listen

You Crucify Yourself
Look whats happened baby
Are you still by yourself
Cause I can’t reach you lately
x2

I can’t reach you lately
Look what’s happened baby

You said you’d leave this so run away
You don’t need this so run away
You said you’d leave this so run away
You don’t need this so run away
You said you’d leave this

Look what’s happened baby
I know your cool
I know your cool
I know your cool

You Crucify Yourself
Look whats happened baby
Are you still by yourself
Cause I can’t reach you lately
x2

I can’t reach you lately
Look what’s happened baby
x2
