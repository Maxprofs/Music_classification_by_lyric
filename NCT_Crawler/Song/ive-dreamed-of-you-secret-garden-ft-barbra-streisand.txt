                        Bài hát: I've Dreamed Of You - Secret Garden, Barbra Streisand

I've dreamed of you
Always feeling you were there.
And all my life
I have searched for you everywhere.
I caught your smile in the morning sun
I heard your whisper on the breeze at night.
I prayed one day
That your arms would hold me tight.
And just when I
Thought love had passed me by
We met.
That first look in your eyes I can't forget.
You melted me with your tender touch.
I felt all fear and sorrow slip away.
Now here we stand
Hand in hand
This blessed day.

I promise you
As I give to you my heart
That nothing in this world
Shall keep us apart.
Come happily ever after be
The man I'll love until the very end.
I've dreamed of you
My great love and my best friend.

For God must know
How I love you so.
He's blessed us here today as man and wife.
Come dream with me
As I've dreamed of you
All my life.
Come dream with me
As I have dreamed of you
All my life.
