                        On my Harlem niggas my BK niggas
 Back uptown baby Lennox ave
 My oyas on broadway all day, come on Aye yo, you love the way I rep black step the F back
 'Fore I bring out the guns and chest check respect that
 Any girl I met that hit that, love the way I spit that
 I don't kit kat push your wig back, get you *** snatched Get your ribs cracked, got a friend have me kick that
 Get that sit back school *** skip that
 Learn how to flip pack for the big stacks and the big act
 Now I got the big gats click, clack, uh Since day one been in a ditch came with a snitch
 Now I'm in the pen in the mix
 Friends sending me flicks girls sending me kicks
 Been in some *** had to tap a chin with a fist When the [Incomprehensible] Begin with a stich
 End in a kiss so yo so I blend in the mix
 Now a day don't go by I ain't been in a chick
 Eight on the dope ask Dominican Rich Winning and rich eating on cinnamon grits
 Grinning and *** how a nigga spin in six
 See they all see the twelve but you see me in it
 TV's in it BB's kinted ask who it is You see me tinted I did drive bys
 Now I take you on top of a high rise see if you can sky dive
 I'll bring it to you at your local gymnasium
 How 'bout the palladium, *** it yankees stadium uh Play people jumped up and sprayed people
 I got dudes that'll jiggle with the A's legal
 You not a threat you want it you got it bet
 I'll leave your momma and your poppa wet nigga wait now I'm set I'll go another route
 Kidnap your family make your brother eat your mother out
 After I done dug her out needles to jug her out
 Pillows to smother out, you don't give a *** about I wouldn't talk about I'm through wit' it your crew ain't even true wit' it
 I see your man he's like umm nothing to do with it
 I know you pack like that but Cam why you act like that
 Shut up nigga clack, clack, clack, pat, pat, pat, rat, tat, tat Put fear 'fore envy nigga I'm not in fear of any
 I'll leave a nigga black and blue like a pair of pennys
 While me and betha throw fiestas
 By Alma Queta, Chicqueta, Monero Nieta Don't ever *** around with the don's cheddar
 See Jimmy Jones fronting in the jon cletta
 Or the black boots jumping out to act cool
 Cars never lease 'em girls tease 'em My man and his wife he want me down with the threesome
 Niggas tease 'em bitches please 'em
 When I'm out of town yo my pants got a crease in 'em
 All calls valid never hard mallet Dallas been up in you favorite star's stlyus
 Coward bite on my hoes like Marv Albert
 But you should thank un though coulda made you run though
 Been at your front door gun hold for fun though {Yo, yo, yo, yo what's up? What the *** is wrong with you?
 *** that it's not a game
 Yo, you ain't gotta be rhythming for niggas like that
 Man *** them niggas B, yo, you know what you do
 What? Tell these niggas the real deal, aight check it} Aiyyo cook up the crack, cook up the crack
 Every time you look up a gat got you shook up attack huh
 Look in the back, nahthe guns I had put in the back
 I want the hook up in check on this work of the rap Now I'm not saying what I like or what I dislike
 But get the *** out my face 'til your ***'s right
 See baby boy I carry guns you know the big type
 The kind that might give you a 10 year fear of life And I was just like y'all flippin' hundred pack
 But nowadays I'm the only you a running back
 You got to understand baby I'm done with the crack
 I get pure white coke from Columbian cats Or the cocaine plan leave your whole brain dead
 Light this herb don't mean to disturb
 Never been to Sesame street but I flip a big bird
 And I know stealers and they not from Pittsburgh No kids rapping or ostriches
 Just kidnapings and hostages
 So, y'all better obey we shoot pro way
 Mess with us no way now go 'head go play
