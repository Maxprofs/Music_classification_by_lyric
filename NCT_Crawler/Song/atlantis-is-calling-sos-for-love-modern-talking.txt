                        Atlantis Is Calling (S.O.S. For Love) - Modern Talking

Lady, I know it was hard
But it's much harder to ignore
There is a chance and I'll promise
I won't hurt you anymore
Hollywood nights we're romancin'
You can trust me anytime
Somewhere, oh babe - there is someone
Oh you're dancing in my mind

Ohoho, little queenie
I'm your fool
Come on, teach me the rules
And I will send an S.O.S. for love
Ohoho, little queenie,
I'm your fool 
You need love, like I do
And I will send a S.O.S. for love

Atlantis is calling, S.O.S. for love
Atlantis is calling, from the stars above
Atlantis is calling, S.O.S. for love 
Atlantis is calling, it's too hot to stop

If loving you is wrong, babe
Oh, I don't wanna be right
I've got you under my skin, babe
Oh baby, hold me tight
I'm ready for our romance
I waited million years for you
I love you more than I'm saying
Baby, that's for me the truth
                        
                    |
