                        We could just go home right now
or maybe we could stick around
for just one more drink
oh yeah

Get another bottle out
Let's shoot the breeze
sit back down
for just one more drink
oh yeah

Here's to us
Here's to love
All the times that we messed up
Here's to you
Fill the glass
'Cause the last few days have gone to fast
So let's give 'em
Wish everybody well
Here's to us
Here's to us

We've stuck it out this far together
Put our drinks
through the shredder
Let's toast
'Cause things got better

And everything could change right back
And all these years
Go by so fast, but
nothing lasts forever

Here's to us
Here's to love
All the times that we messed up
Here's to you
Fill the Glass
'Cause the last few nights have gone too fast
If they give ya
Tell 'em forget themselves
Here's to us
Here's to us

Here's to all that we kissed
And to all that we missed
To the biggest mistakes
That we just wouldn't dream
To us breakin' out
Without us breakin' down
To whatever is comin' our way

Here's to us
Here's to us
(Here's to us
Here's to love
All the times that we messed up)
Here's to you
Fill the glass
'Cause the last few days have gone too fast
So let's give 'em
Wish everybody well
(Here's to us
Here's to love)
All the times that we messed up
Here's to you
Fill the glass
'Cause the last few nights have gone too fast
If they give ya
Tell 'em forget themselves
Here's to us
(Here's to us)
Oh here's to us
(Here's to us)
Here's to us
Here's to love
Wish everybody well
Here's to us
Here's to love
Here's to us
Here's to us
                        
                    |
