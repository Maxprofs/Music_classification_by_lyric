                        Bài hát: Shatter Me - Nightcore

I pirouette in the dark 
I see the stars through a mirror 
Tired mechanical heart 
Beats 'til the song disappears 

Somebody shine a light 
I'm frozen by the fear in me 
Somebody make me feel alive 
And shatter me 
So cut me from the line 
Dizzy, spinning endlessly 
Somebody make me feel alive 
And shatter me 

Shatter me! 
Somebody make me feel alive 
And shatter me 

If only the clockwork could speak 
I wouldn't be so alone 
We'd burn every magnet and spring 
And spiral into the unknown 

If I break the glass then I'll have to fly 
There's no one to catch me if I take a dive 
I'm scared of change and the days stay the same 
The world is spinning but only in gray 
If I break the glass then I'll have to fly 
There's no one to catch me if I take a dive 
I'm scared of change and the days stay the same 
The world is spinning but only in gray 
(Only...) 

Me...! 
Shatter me! 
Somebody make me feel alive 
And shatter me!
                        
                    |
