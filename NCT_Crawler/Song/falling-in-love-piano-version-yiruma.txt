[ar:Taio Cruz]
[al:]

It must be love because we are to afraid to say
It must be love and so we paint everything in grey
Let's not lose this chance
Hold onto my hands
Let's not waste this time

'Cause today is a great day for falling in love
'Cause today is a great day for falling in love
Falling in love

It must be hard to know that we'll never be the same
It must be hard to take this honoured leap of faith
Let's not lose our way
Let's not wait to say
How we feel inside

'Cause today is a great day for falling in love
'Cause today is a great day for falling in love
Falling in love, falling in love
Falling in love, falling in love

'Cause today is a great day for falling in love
Falling in love

When you're falling, falling
Just don't let go
When you're falling, falling
Just don't let go

Let's not lose this chance
Hold onto my hands
Let's not waste this time

'Cause today is a great day for falling in love
'Cause today is a great day for falling in love
Falling in love, falling in love
Falling in love, falling in love

'Cause today is a great day for falling in love
Falling in love
