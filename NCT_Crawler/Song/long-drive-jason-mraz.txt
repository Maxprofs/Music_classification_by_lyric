                        Bài hát: Long Drive - Jason Mraz

Long drive, long night
The best night of my life, 
With you riding, your hand on my hand. 
The thought of arriving, kind of feels like, dying.
I don’t want, to go home and be, alone.
Could we, stay out?
Could you, drive a little slower, don’t matter where we’re going,
As long as I’m with you, we could take the long way.
Chevy Nova, front seat, sofa, getting closer, to you.
Drive a little slower; don’t matter where we’re going, 
As long as I’m with you, we could take the long way.
Drive a little slower, not ready to go home,
I’d rather stay with you.
We could take the long way, to the country out of town.
Let’s get lost; I don’t wanna be found.
Let’s get away, now and be careful not to crash.
There’s no defrost and we’re steaming the glass.
You and the road have a generous shoulder
We can pull over and say we took the long way.
Headlights, not strobe lights,
I can see you, but not quite. 
I can feel you inside; the timing is just right.
For the moment, I don’t want to go home.
Take the long way.
Drive a little slower; don’t matter where we’re going.
Take the long way.
Drive a little slower; don’t matter where we going now.
Take the long way
Drive a little slower; not ready to go home.
I’d rather stay with you.
We can take the long way.
Long drive, long night, 
The best night of my life.
