                        Bài hát: Ain'T No Party (Remix 2015) - Dj Tino

C`mon!
C`mon!
C`mon!

I get drunk when I strumble to my phone,
to call just at my girl,
to bone when I`m alone.
Oh no, she`s drunk to,
I only got to kiss.
Only when I`m drunk I sing a song like this.

`Cause there ain`t ain`t ain`t ain`t ain`t
`Cause there ain`t no party, like an alcoholic party.
Ain`t no party, like an alcoholic party.
`Cause there ain`t no party, like an alcoholic party.
Ain`t no party, like an alcoholic party.
`Cause there ain`t no party, like an alcoholic party...

All right girl.
You`ve got to show me some vibes.
C`mon!

Feel the vibes,
Feel the vibe through your body.
Feel the alcohol tonight.
Feel the vibes,
Feel the vibe through your body.
Feel the vibes,
Feel the vibe through you body.
Feel the alcohol tonight.

Because there ain`t,
Because there ain`t,
Because there ain`t no party like an alocoholic party.

Feel the vibe through your body.
Feel the alcohol tonight.
Alcohol tonight, Alcohol tonight, Alcohol tonight.

C`mon!
`Cause there ain`t no party, like an alcoholic party.
Ain`t no party, like an alcoholic party.
`Cause there ain`t no party, like an alcoholic party.
Ain`t no party, like an alcoholic party.
`Cause there ain`t no party, like an alcoholic party...

Only when I`m drunk I sing a song like this.

I get drunk when I strumble to my phone,
to call just at my girl,
to bone when I`m alone.
Oh no, know she`s drunk to,
I only got to kiss.
Only when I`m drunk I sing a song like this...

`Cause there ain`t no party, like an alcoholic party.
Ain`t no party, like an alcoholic party.
`Cause there ain`t no party, like an alcoholic party.
Ain`t no party, like an alcoholic party.
`Cause there ain`t no party, like an alcoholic party...

You`ve got to show me some vibes.
C`mon!

Feel the vibes,
Feel the vibe through your body.
Feel the alcohol tonight.
Feel the vibes,
Feel the vibe through your body.
Feel the vibes,
Feel the vibe through you body.
Feel the alcohol tonight.

`Cause there ain`t no party, like an alcoholic party.
Ain`t no party, like an alcoholic party.
`Cause there ain`t no party, like an alcoholic party...
