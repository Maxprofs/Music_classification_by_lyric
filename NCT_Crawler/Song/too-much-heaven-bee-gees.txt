                        Bài hát: Too Much Heaven - Bee Gees

Chorus:
Nobody gets too much heaven no more
Its much harder to come by
Im waiting in line
Nobody gets too much love anymore
Its as high as a mountain
And harder to climb

Oh you and me girl
Got a lot of love in store
And it flows through you
And it flows through me
And I love you so much more
Then my life..i can see beyond forever
Evrything we are will never die
Lovings such a beautiful thing
Oh you make my world.. a summer day
Are you just a dream to fade away

Chorus..

You and me girl got a highway to the sky
We can turn away from the night and day
And the tears we had to pay(u hade to cry)
Youre my life..
I can see a new tomorrow
Evrything we are will never die
Lovings such a beautiful thing
When you are to me, the light above
Made for all to see our presious love

Chorus..

Love is such a beautiful thing
You make my world a summer day
Are you just a dream to fade away

Chorus..

Nobody gets too much love anymore
Its as wide as a river and harder to cross
                        
                    |
