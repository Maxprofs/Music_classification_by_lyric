                        Bài hát: I Knew You Were The One - Tiffany Alvord

I never thought that
a guy like you would give a girl like me a shot
I think maybe I like you just a little
or maybe it's a lot

'Cause when I close my eyes

(da da da da)x7
I knew I knew
You were the one

(da da da da)x6
I knew I knew
You were the one

When your eyes met mine
the butterflies in my bellies came alive
One step closer
a one in a million feeling that you can't fight

'Cause when I close my eyes

(da da da da)x7
I knew I knew
You were the one

(da da da da)x6
I knew I knew
You were the one

Slowly swaying as you take me
and you pull me in a little closer
Slowly swaying when our eyes meet
we feel the magic in the air take over

Hush, hush there's no need to talk
We say it all when our lips lock

(da da da da)x7
I knew I knew
You were the one

(da da da da)x6
I knew I knew
You were the one

(da da da da)x5
I knew I knew
You were the one
                        
                    |
