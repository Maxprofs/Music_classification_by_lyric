                        Song: Turn All The Lights On - T-Pain, Ne-Yo

turn all the lights on

take off your shoes shoes shoes
ain't nobody gon' see nothin
bring out the booze booze booze
baby girl stop frontin'
ain't nothin' to lose lose lose
and i ain't gotta work no more
*** that place
*** my boss
i'm about to ball girl where the cars

[bridge]
so i'm going hard
i need some lights it's way too dark
oh yeah i'm going in
and now i'm with my friends
let the party begin!

[chorus]
turn all the lights on!
a-a-a-a-a-a-a aaa
a-a-a-a-a-a-a
turn all the lights on
a-a-a-a-a-a-a aaa a-a-a-a-a-a-a
put your hands up if you'r going hard
i need some lights it's way too dark
ooh yeah i'm going in
okay okay i'm with my friends
let the party begin
turn all the lights on!

[ne-yo - verse 2]
gimme that glass
little bit of ice
pour that rain in there
this must be her song
dancing like ain't nobody else in here
sexy as she wanna be and she
dancing next so close to me
i said please excuse
you steppin' on expensive shoes
shawty is a perfect ten
this angelic body made you sin
i love the way you get it in
come over here and shake it for a gentleman
cause you want it

[bridge]
she's going hard
i need some lights it's way too dark
oh yeah i'm going in
and now i'm with my friends
let the party begin!

[chorus]
turn all the lights on!
a-a-a-a-a-a-a aaa
a-a-a-a-a-a-a
turn all the lights on
a-a-a-a-a-a-a aaa
a-a-a-a-a-a-a
put your hands up if you'r going hard
i need some lights it's way too dark
ooh yeah i'm going in
okay okay i'm with my friends
let the party begin
turn all the lights on!

i'm drinking something
i'm touching something
they need to turn up the lights
i'm drinking something
