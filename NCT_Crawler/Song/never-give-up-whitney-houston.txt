                        Song: Never Give Up - Whitney Houston

Till you get it right, tell em you will never quit 
tell em you will never quit until the day you get it right, 
till you get it right, hold your hand to the sky 
look em right in the eye, tell em you will never quit 
until the day you get it right 
till you get it right 
tell em you will never quit, until the day you get it right 
till you get it right, hold your hand to the sky 
look em right in the eye, tell em you will never quit 
until the day you get it right 

Single mother, two jobs, workin her fingers to the bone 
putting her daughters mouth before her own 
she's gotta do it, but she's still feeling 
like there's something deep inside that she can't leave behind 
she won't let go of it, no matter how many times 
she hears it over with, it's all fixed in her mind 
that it's gonna get better and she won't ever 
hang her head again, break a sweat again, never again 

Chorus: 
Never never give up, never never give up, 
no matter how many times, somebody tells you it ain't working 
Never never give up, never never give up, 
hold your head tot he sky, look them right in the eyes 
tell you will never quit until the day you get it right 
Never never give up, never never give up, 
even though some days you'll have to cry, 
shake it off and know that everything will be alright 
as long as you never never give up, never never give up. 

College student, paying her own way, 
working the club at night 
look what she go through, to stay in law school 
so maybe one day, she can make her way in a man's world 
and never be called just another girl 
it ain't nothing like a dream you can't see 
even when the people round you don't believe 
but in the twelfth round, when you're against the ropes, 
here comes your last minute miracle, 
you've got to know to 

Chorus: 
Never never give up, never never give up, 
no matter how many times, somebody tells you it ain't working 
Never never give up, never never give up, 
hold your head to the sky, look them right in the eyes 
tell you will never quit until the day you get it right 
Never never give up, never never give up, 
even though some days you'll have to cry, 
shake it off and know that everything will be alright 
as long as you never never give up, never never give up. 

The sky is the limit, for whatever you want to do 
don't let anyone tell you, it ain't possible 
no matter how low you feel, keep going higher, higher 
see I've been holding on, to my dreams too long 
to watch it get away from me, 
this hand is mine to win, and I promise you that 
I'll never never give up 

[2 x Chorus:]
