White Shadows

When I was a young boy
I tried to listen
And I wanna feel like that
Little white shadow
Blink and glisten
Part of a system I am

If you ever feel like
something's missing
Things you'll never understand
Little white shadows
Sparkle and glisten
Part of a system plan
All the smiles are waking up
All the space I'm taking up
Oh the sun is breaking up
oooohh....
Maybe you get what you wanted
Maybe you stumbled upon it
Everything you ever wanted
In a permanent state
Maybe you go and you see it
Maybe if you say it, you'll mean it
And when you find that you keep me
In a permanent state ...a permanent state

When I was a young boy
I tried to listen
Don't you wanna feel like that?
You're part of the human race
All of the stars and the outer space
Part of the system plan
All the smiles are waking up
All the space I'm taking up
I cannot hear you breaking up
oooohh....
Maybe you get what you wanted
Maybe you stumbled upon it
Everything you ever wanted
In a permanent state
Maybe you go and you see it
Maybe if you say it, you'll mean it
And when you find that you keep me
In a permanent state ...a permanent state..

I swear I'm only seeing faces
Tired of the human races
Oh, answer now is what I need
See it in a new sun rising
See it break on your horizon
Oh, come on love, stay with me
                        
                    |
