                        Bài hát: Our Day Will Come - Amy Winehouse 

Our day will come
And we'll have everything
We'll share the joy
Falling in love can bring
No one can tell me
That I'm too young to know
I love you so
And you love me

Our day will come
If we just wait awhile
No tears for us
Think loving with a smile
Our dreams are meant to be
'Cause we'll always stay
In love this way
Our day, will come

Our dreams are meant to be
'Cause we'll always stay
In love this way
Our day, will come
Our day, will come
                        
                    |
