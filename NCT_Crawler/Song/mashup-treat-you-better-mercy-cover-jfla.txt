                        Bài hát: Mashup Treat You Better & Mercy Cover - J.Fla

I won't lie to you 
I know he's just not right for you 
And you can tell me if I'm off 
But I see it on your face 
When you say that he's the one that you want 
And you're spending all your time 
In this wrong situation 
And anytime you want it to stop 

Please have mercy on me 
Take it easy on my heart 
Even though you don't mean to hurt me 
You keep tearing me apart 
Would you please have mercy, mercy on my heart 
Would you please have mercy, mercy on my heart 

I'll stop time for you 
The second you say you'd like me too 
I just wanna give you the loving that you're missing 
Baby, just to wake up with you 
Would be everything I need and this could be so different 
Tell me what you want to do 

Please have mercy on me 
Take it easy on my heart 
Even though you don't mean to hurt me 
You keep tearing me apart 
Would you please have mercy, mercy on my heart 
Would you please have mercy, mercy on my heart 

Give me a sign 
Take my hand, we'll be fine 
Promise I won't let you down 
Just know that you don't 
Have to do this alone 
Promise I'll never let you down
                        
                    |
