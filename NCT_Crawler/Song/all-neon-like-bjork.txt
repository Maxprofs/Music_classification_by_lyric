                        Not 'til you haylo all over me
I'll come over
Not 'til it shimmers around your skull
I'll be yours...
I weave for you
The marvellous web
Bjork
Glow-in-the-dark-threads
All neon like
The coccoon surrounds you
Embraces all
So you can sleep
Foetus-style
They will assist us
'Cause we're asking for help
And the luminious beam-it feeds you!
The soft distortion
Fills you up
Nourish nourish
Your turtle-heart
Don't get angry with yourself !
..I'll heal you...
..With a razorblade, I'll cut a slit open
And the luminious beam feeds you, honey!
