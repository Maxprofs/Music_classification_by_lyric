                        You got my attention
At hello
We had this connection
That wouldn't let go
There was something sexy
About your voice
Anything you say
Makes a beautiful noise

Oh-oh

And now we break up
To make up right away (we make up right away)
Just an excuse
To lay in bad all day (oh we'll lay in bed all day)
I know that this thing we have
Won't ever change
That's why I have
The confidence to say

[Chorus:]
A lot of girls are sexy
But you know how to use it
You can keep me
Up on the phone all night
We say let's hang up on three
But we don't ever do it
Ain't it crazy
How after all this time
We got that you hang up
No, you hang up kinda love
We got that you hang up
No, you hang up kinda love

Every time you call me
I won't lie
I still get the goosebumps
I felt the first time
That I saw you walk
In to a room
Girl, you had me hooked
On that beautiful view

And now we break up
And now we break up
To make up right away (oh, we make up right away)
Just an excuse
To lay in bad all day (and we lay in bed all day)
I know that this thing we have
Won't ever change
That's why I have
The confidence to say

[Chorus]

We got that you hang up
No, you hang up kinda love (kinda love)

Baby you still know
Just how to blow my mind
And after everything that we've been through
It still feels right
(Girl and I) I know
(That) I can't
Picture living my life
Without you

Yeah, yeah, yeah

[Chorus:]
A lot of girls are sexy
But you know how to use it
You can keep me
Up on the phone all night (all night)
We say let's hang up on three
But we don't ever do it
Ain't it crazy
How after all this time
We got that you hang up
No, you hang up kinda love
We got that you hang up
No, you hang up kinda love

A lot of girls are sexy (a lot of girls are so sexy)
You can keep me
Up on the phone all night (oh, you better watch)
We say let's hang up on three (you hang up, no, you hang up kinda love)
But we don't ever do it (you hang up you hang up kinda love)
Ain't it crazy
How after all this time

We got that you hang up. No, you hang up kinda love [x4]
