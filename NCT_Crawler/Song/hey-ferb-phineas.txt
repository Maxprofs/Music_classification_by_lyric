                        Phineas: I know what we're gonna do today,
 though it might sound just a bit clich.
 We can build a rollercoaster, but this time with songs and dancing!
 'Cause when we're back in school come next September,
 And they ask us, we can both remember
 Every cool and clever thing we did all summer long, and glancing
 back we're gonna be so glad that we
 didn't sit all day and watch TV,
 I don't think anyone can disagree
 the world is possibilities
 And that's what makes me say:
 Phineas and Chorus: Hey Ferb!
 Phineas: Hey Ferb, I know what we're gonna do today
 Hey Ferb, I know what we're gonna do today
 Hey Ferb, I know what we're gonna do today!...
 Phineas and Chorus: Hey Ferb!
 Background singers: Boredom is something up with which I will not put
 Phineas: Hey Ferb, I know what we're gonna do today
 Hey Ferb, I know what we're gonna do today
 Hey Ferb, I know what we're gonna do today!...
 Phineas and Chorus: Hey Ferb!
 Phineas: Hey Ferb, I know what we're gonna do today
 Hey Ferb, I know what we're gonna do today
 Hey Ferb, I know what we're gonna do today!...
 Background singers: Boredom is something up with which I will not put
 Phineas and Chorus: Hey Ferb!
 Phineas: Hey Ferb, I know what we're gonna do today
 Hey Ferb, I know what we're gonna do today
 Hey Ferb, I know what we're gonna do today!
 Hey Ferb!
