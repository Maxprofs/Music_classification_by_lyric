                        OH JULIE 

( SHAKIN STEVENS ) 

Whoa, whoa Julie 
If you love me truly 
Do you want me, Julie, to be, be your very own 

Julie, love me only 
Julie, don't be lonely 
'Cause I want you only to be, to be my very own 

Ooh, Baby, don't leave me, honey, don't grieve me 
Julie, why leave me alone 
Stay with me, baby, lay with me maybe 
Honey, don't leave me alone 

Julie, never leave me, 
please, don't decieve me 
Julie, oh, believe me and be, be my very own 

Whoa, whoa, Julie 
If you love me truly 
Do you want me, Julie, to be, be your very own 

Ooh, Baby, don't leave me, honey, don't grieve me 
Julie, why leave me alone 
Stay with me, baby, lay with me maybe 
Honey, don't leave me alone 

Julie, never leave me 
please, don't decieve me 
Julie, oh, believe me and be, be my very own 

Whoa, whoa, Julie 
If you love me truly 
Do you want me, Julie, to be, be your very own 
To be, to be, to be, be your very own 
To be, to be, to be, to be your very own
