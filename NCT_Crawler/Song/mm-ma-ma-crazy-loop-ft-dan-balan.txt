                        Crazy Loop (Mm-ma-ma)

Mm-ma-ma mara
Mm-ma-ma-ma
Mm-ma-Mm mara
Mm-ma-Mm
Ma-ma-a.

Mm-ma-ma mara
Mm-ma-ma-ma-ma
Ma-ma-ma.

Taking pictures with honeys
Spending all mo-mo-money
If you want it so badly
Then why don't you say so, lady.

You'll be hurt if you'll kiss me
You gotta gotta believe me
But if you want it so badly
Then why don't you say so, lady.

And If you'd wanna take it back
You don't wanna take it back
You don't wanna take it back, my love
Don't you wanna love?
Babe,you don't wanna take it back
Don't wanna take it back
Back, back, back.

They call me Crazy Loooop
Gotta gotta be crazy loooop
Gotta get a life
Oh, mom, I've trïed
Gotta gotta be lonely-lon-lon-lon.
