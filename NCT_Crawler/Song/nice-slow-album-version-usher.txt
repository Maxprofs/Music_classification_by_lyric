 Ah what cha doing

 Now you got it hot for me already baby
 Okay

 Be ready
 Ah

 Now baby tell what you wanna do with me

 It's seven o' clock
 On the dot
 I'm in my drop top
 Cruisin the streets (oh yeah)
 I gotta real pretty pretty little thang that's waiting for me
 I pull up
 Anticipating
 Good love
 Don't keep me waiting
 I got plans to put my hands in places
 I never seen girl you know what I mean

 Hook

 Let me take you to a place nice and quiet
 There ain't no one there to interrupt
 Ain't gotta rush
 I just want to take it nice and slow
 Now baby tell what you wanna do with me
 See I've been waiting for this for so long
 We'll be makin' love until the sun cones up
 Baby
 I just wanna take it nice and slow
 Now baby tell what you wanna do with me

 Now here we are
 Drivin' round town
 Contemplating where I'm gonna lay you down
 Girl you got me sayin'
 My My My
 I wish that I (I)
 Could pull over

 And get this thing started right now
 I wanna do something freaky to you baby
 I don't think they heard me
 I wanna do something freaky to you baby
 So call out my name

 Rap

 Now baby tell me what you wanna do with me
 Gotta nigga from feenin' like jocdeci
 Every time that you roll with me holdin' me
 Tryin to get control of me
 Nice and slowly
 You know
 Never lettin' go
 Never messin' up the flow

 Hook

 Let me take you to a place nice and quiet
 There ain't noone there to interrupt
