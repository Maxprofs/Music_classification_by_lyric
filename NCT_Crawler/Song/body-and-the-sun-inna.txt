                        Bài hát: Body And The Sun - Inna

We were sexy, we were bad
We were everything everyone wished they had
We were crazy, we were good
We'll do everything that others just wished they could
We were falling when the skies were blue
It's a shame how winter came too soon,
Try to love you but the love falls too
Should we let it go, let it go, let it go?

Uuuh, I've been thinking 'bout you
You've been thinking 'bout me
All the things that we've done,
Oh, I miss your BODY and the SUN!
I've been thinking 'bout you
You've been thinking 'bout me
We were nothing but fun,
Oh, I miss your BODY and the SUN!

Ain't no limits, ain't no rules
And we're doing all they tell us we can't do
We'll get crazy, we'll be cool
We'll do everything that others just wished they could
We were falling when the skies were blue
It's a shame how winter came too soon,
Try to love you but the love falls too
Should we let it go, let it go, let it go?

Uuuh, I've been thinking 'bout you
You've been thinking 'bout me
All the things that we've done,
Oh, I miss your BODY and the SUN!
I've been thinking 'bout you
You've been thinking 'bout me
We were nothing but fun,
Oh, I miss your BODY and the SUN!
Oh, I miss your BODY and the SUN!

Uuuh uh uuuh uh uh uh
Uuuh uh uuuh uh uh uh
Uuuh uh uuuh uh uh uh

I've been thinking 'bout you
I've been thinking 'bout you
I've been thinking 'bout you
I've been thinking 'bout you
Oh, I miss your BODY and the SUN!
Oh, I miss your BODY and the SUN!
Oh, I miss your BODY and the SUN!
