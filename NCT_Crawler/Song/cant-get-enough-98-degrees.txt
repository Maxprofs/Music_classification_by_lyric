                        (Intro)
All I want is your loving,
All I need is you, baby,
All I want is your loving,
Come on, girl, cause you give me.
All I want is your loving,
All I need is you, baby,
All I want is your loving,
Come on, girl, cause you give me.

(Verse)
Uh, something about the way you move for me
It may be too soon, but already you’ve got me wondering.
What you’re thinking, girl?
And when the music stops will you hold me still?
Because I won’t let go, I can’t let go,
Cause this feeling I just can’t control,
Forgive me for going overboard, but

(Chorus)
I can’t get enough of your love,
I can’t get enough of your love,
You make it feel so right,
That’s why I just can’t get enough.
I can’t get enough of your love,
Is the only thing bringing me up,
And now I want tonight,
Can’t get enough of your love.

(Verse)
Baby girl, I can’t explain the things you do to me, yeah
Gotta play it cool, just to leave a little mystery, yeah.
Or I can be there morning, noon and night, say the words and I be by your side
With a little more each time, just so I’m the reason that you smile,
That ain’t no way to fight it, I just

(Chorus)
I can’t get enough of your love,
I can’t get enough of your love,
You make it feel so right,
That’s why I just can’t get enough.
I can’t get enough of your love,
Is the only thing bringing me up,
And now I want tonight,
Can’t get enough of your love.

(Bridge)
I just can’t get enough, I just can’t get enough,
I just can’t get enough, I just can’t get...
I can’t get enough of your love, I can’t get enough of it
I can’t get enough of your love, can’t get enough of it
Can’t get enough of your love, can’t get enough of it
Can’t get enough of your love, can’t get enough of it.

(Chorus)
I can’t get enough of your love,
I can’t get enough of your love,
You make it feel so right,
That’s why I just can’t get enough.
I can’t get enough of your love,
Is the only thing bringing me up,
And now I want tonight,
Can’t get enough of your love.

(Outro)
All I want is your loving,
All I need is you, baby,
All I want is your loving,
All I want is your loving,
All I need is you, baby,
All I want is your loving,

I can’t help it, I just can’t
You know I’m dying, baby
Yeah, I’m dying, baby,
I can tell you, baby,
Do you want me, baby?
I wanna love you, baby
And I’m trying, baby
But I need you baby
Come on baby
Can’t get enough of you, can’t get enough of you
Can’t get enough of you, can’t get enough of you.
