                        Song: Can You Hear Me - Enrique Iglesias

Can you hear me?!

I'm numb but I can still feel you
Sometimes Im blind but I see you
Youre here but so far away

The times when you are not missing
You make me feel like Im spinning
Sometimes you get what you gave

Im on a course of collision
Im not about to give in
Cant explain my position
Or the condition Im in

Where I am theres no limit
No walls, no ceiling
No intermission
So let the party begin

Hey, hey, all the way!
DJ let it play!
Hey, hey, can you hear me?
Oh oh oh!

Hey, hey, all the way!
DJ let it play!
Hey, hey, can you hear me?
Oh oh oh!

Can you hear me?
Can you hear me?
Can you hear me?
Can you hear me? Oh oh oh!

Though you may not share my vision
I gotta make a decision
Do I go? Do I stay?

Youve gotten into my system
You're in control of my mental
I'm in a euphoric state, yeah!

Im on a course of collision
Im not about to give in
Cant explain my position
Or the condition Im in

Where I am theres no limit
No walls, no ceiling
No intermission
So let the party begin

Hey, hey, all the way!
DJ let it play!
Hey, hey, can you hear me?
Can you hear me?!

Hey, hey, all the way!
DJ let it play!
Hey, hey, can you hear me?
Oh oh oh!

Oh oh, oh oh, oh
Oh oh, oh oh, oh
Oh oh, oh oh, oh
Oh oh, oh oh, oh

Can you hear me?
(Oh oh, oh oh, oh)
Can you hear me?
(Oh oh, oh oh, oh)
Can you hear me?
(Oh oh, oh oh, oh)
Can you hear me?
(Oh oh, oh oh, oh)
Can you hear me?!

Hey, hey, all the way!
DJ let it play!
Hey, hey, can you hear me?
Can you hear me?!

Hey, hey, all the way!
DJ let it play!
Hey, hey, can you hear me?
Can you hear me?!

Hey, hey, all the way!
DJ let it play!
Hey, hey, can you hear me?
Can you hear me?!

Hey, hey, all the way!
DJ let it play!
Hey, hey, can you hear me?

(Oh oh, oh oh, oh)
Hey, hey, all the way!

Hey, hey, can you hear me?
