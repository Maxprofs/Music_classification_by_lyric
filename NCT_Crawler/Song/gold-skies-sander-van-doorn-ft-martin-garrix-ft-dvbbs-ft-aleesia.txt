                        Bài hát: Gold Skies - Sander van Doorn, Martin Garrix, DVBBS, Aleesia

See the smoke when the sun shines 
We will forever be faded under gold skies 
Captivated in your cold eyes 
We will forever be faded under gold skies 
See the smoke when the sun shines 
We will forever be faded under gold skies 
Captivated in your cold eyes 
We will forever be faded under gold skies 

Coming up, cut me down, look at all the stuff we found 
Just the sun, feel me now, we will live forever 
Coming up, cut me down, look at all the stuff we found 
Just the sun, feel me now, we will live forever 
Coming up, cut me down, look at all the stuff we found 
Just the sun, feel me now, we will live forever 
Coming up, cut me down, look at all the stuff we found 
Just the sun, feel me now, we will live forever 

Coming up x13 
We will forever be faded under gold skies
