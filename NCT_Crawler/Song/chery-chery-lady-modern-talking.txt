                        Oh, I cannot explain
Every time it's the same
More I feel that it's real
Take my heart
Ive been lonely to long
Oh, I can't be so strong
Take the chance for romance, take my heart
I need you so.....
There's no time
I'll ever go.....

Cheri, cheri lady
Going through emotion
Love is where you find it
Listen to your heart
Cheri, cheri lady
Livin' in devotion
It's always like the first time
Let me take a part

Cheri, cheri lady
Like theres no tomorrow
Take my heart - dont lose it
Listen to your heart
Cheri, cheri lady
To know you is to love you
If you call me baby I'll be always yours

I get up - I get down
All my world turns around
Who is right ? who is wrong ? 
I don't know
I've got pain in my heart
Got some love in my soul
Easy come, but I think easy go
I need you so.....
Although times
I move so slow.....
