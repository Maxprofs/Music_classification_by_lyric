                        Song: Until The End Of Time - Justin Timberlake, Beyonce

I woke up this mornin'
And heard the TV sayin' somethin'
About disaster in the world and
It made me wonder where I'm goin'

There's so much darkness in the world
But I see beauty left in you girl
And what you give me lets me know
That I'll be alright

'Cause if your love was all I had in this life
Well that would be enough until the end of time
So rest your weary heart and relax your mind
'Cause I'm gonna love you girl until the end of time

You got me singin' oh yeah, oh yeah
Everybody sing oh yeah
Everybody singin' oh yeah

Now if you're ever wonderin'
About the way I'm feelin'
Well baby boy there ain't no question
Just to be around you is a blessing

Sick and tired of tryin' to save the world
I just wanna spend my time bein' your girl
And what you give me lets me know
That we'll be alright

'Cause if your love was all I had in this life
That would be enough until the end of time
Rest your weary heart and relax your mind
'Cause I'm gonna love you boy until the end of time

Boy you got me singin' oh yeah
You got me singin' oh yeah, yeah
Everybody singin' oh yeah
Everybody singin' oh yeah yeah yeah yeah

This one's for the lovers
If you're out there let me hear you say
Yeah yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah
This one's for the lovers
If you're out there let me hear you say
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah

This one's for the lovers
If you're out there let me hear you say
Yeah yeah yeah yeah, yeah yeah yeah yeah
This one's for the lovers
If you're out there let me hear you say
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah
Break it down one time

Oh, oh, oh
Break it down one more time Justin
Oh, oh yeah, oh, oh

'Cause if your love was all I had in this life
That would be enough until the end of time
