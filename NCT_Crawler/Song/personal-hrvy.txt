                        Bài hát: Personal - HRVY

[Verse 1]
I don’t know why’d do this to me
You're so cold, You’d be playing like
Ye ye ye ye, ye ye ye ye, ye
I got told danger follows every where you go
But I still be like
Ye ye ye ye, ye ye ye ye, ye

[Pre-Chorus]
This the part where I’m gonna get hurt
I never listened but I didn’t deserve it
I was young and she was my first love
So they say, that you live and you learn

[Chorus 1]
Like ye, she gon' mess with your head
Oh ye, and she’ll flirt with your friends
Oh ye, make you wish you were dead
Every time she moves on she says
Don’t take it personal (don’t take it personal)
Every time she moves on she says

[Verse 2]
Who else knows
All my friends are blowing up my phone
Something's telling me
No no no no, no no no no, no
Oh

[Pre-Chorus]
This the part where I’m gonna get hurt
I never listened but I didn’t deserve it
I was young and she was my first love
So they say, that you live and you learn

[Chorus 1]
Like ye, she gon' mess with your head
Oh ye, and she’ll flirt with your friends
Oh ye, make you wish you were dead
Every time she moves on she says
Don’t take it personal (don’t take it personal)
Every time she moves on she says

[Bridge]
She won’t do you no favours
Beautiful but she dangerous
She was only gon' break you
Drive me crazy like
Ye ye ye ye, ye ye ye ye, ye
She won’t do you no favours
Beautiful but she dangerous
She was only gon' break you
Drive me crazy like
Ye ye ye ye, ye ye ye ye, ye

[Chorus 2]
Oh yeah, she gon' mess with your head
Oh yeah, and she’ll flirt with your friends
Oh yeah, make you wish you were dead
Every time she moves on she says...
Yeah, she gon' mess with your head
Oh yeah, and she’ll flirt with your friends
Oh yeah, make you wish you were dead
Every time she moves on she says
Yeah, she gon' mess with your head
Oh yeah, and she’ll flirt with your friends
Oh yeah, make you wish you were dead
Every time she moves on she says
Don’t take it personal (don’t take it personal)
Every time she moves on she says.
