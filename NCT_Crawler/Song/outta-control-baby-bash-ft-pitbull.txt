                        I don't need no love, all I need is the DJ
 I don't need no love, all I need is the DJ It was midnight
 I got the booty call
 She said "I'm at the club"
 So I threw on my drawers I'm lookin' throwed in my 'fit
 Candy coat on my whip
 The po-po's all on my tip
 But man, I don't even trip Sent me a dirty text
 So I text her back
 Scooped up the Stuey Boy
 'Cause he had the purple sacks And now we gone with the wind
 It's on and poppin' again
 We rebel rockin' and rollin'
 This club is outta c-, outta c-, ou-ou-outta control She got me outta control
 She make you go crazy when she out on the on floor
 She know the DJ, he's on Serato
 He date them models, he crack them bottles Everybody say, fellas, what do ladies like? Money, money, money
 Ladies, what do fellas like? They monkey, monkey, monkey
 Money, money, it's outta control
 She showed that monkey, whoo, it's outta control I'm double fistin' now, under a strobe light
 Its lookin' like a movie, but it's feelin' so tight
 Now I got one in the cage, and I got two on the stage
 I got a waitress on the under tryna' give me some face They played some Lil Wayne
 Mixed with some T-Pain
 They mashed a Journey record
 Now they dropped some Coldplay And now they playin' my song
 The girls, they showin' their thongs
 We rebel rockin' and rollin'
 This club is outta c-, outta c-, ou-ou-outta control She got me outta control
 She make you go crazy when she out on the on floor
 She know the DJ, he's on Serato
 He date them models, he crack them bottles Everybody say, fellas, what do ladies like? Money, money, money
 Ladies, what do fellas like? They monkey, monkey, monkey
 Money, money, it's outta control
 She showed that monkey, whoo, it's outta control, yes sir! I don't need no love, all I need is the DJ
 I don't need no love, all I need is the DJ
 I don't need no love, all I need is the DJ
 I don't need no love, all I need is the DJ
 I don't need no love, all I need is the DJ, DJ Outta control, she he got me outta control
 She make you go crazy when she out on the on floor
 She know the DJ, he's on Serato
 He date them models, he crack them bottles Everybody say, fellas, what do ladies like? Money, money, money
 Ladies, what do fellas like? They monkey, monkey, monkey
 Money, money, it's outta control
 She showed that monkey, whoo, it's outta control, yes sir! Eh, eh, it's outta control
 Eh, eh, it's outta control
 Eh, eh, it's outta control
 Eh, eh, it's outta control
 It's outta control, control, control
