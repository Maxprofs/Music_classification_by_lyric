Manic Drive
Blue

Mold black models out of clay
I thought I made a masterpiece
Compared it to clones
I thought I made an art that was unique
Only minutes crossed me by
Something drastic caught my eye
My model look the same as my
Acquaintance' models once it dried
Dumbfounded scratching my head
Let's try again and instead
I'll use my strength and fingernails
Until I come up with something else new
I'll turn this black into blue

CHORUS
Tried my own way
Still I can never feel at home
Please don't remind me
That I can't do this on my own
Change my will to Yours
Since I've been proven wrong again
Tear my grey clouds and let my skies go blue who who who who who

Made a smart judgment today
Thought my choice was good for me
My choice was better than anything I ever dreamed
Only seconds crossed me by
When her lips drew out that lie
My heart turned black when I lost hope
I've never noticed till it dried
Dumbfounded scratching my head
Let's try again and instead
Use me, consume me, deliver me
From the stupid things I always do
Turn this black into blue

CHORUS
Tried my own way
Still I can never feel at home
Please don't remind me
That I can't do this on my own
Change my will to Yours
Since I've been proven wrong again
Tear my grey clouds and let my skies go blue who who who who who

CHORUS
