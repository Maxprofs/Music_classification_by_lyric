                        Bài hát: Midnight City - M83

Waiting in a car
Waiting for a ride in the dark
The night city grows
Look and see her eyes, they glow.

Waiting in a car
Waiting for a ride in the dark
Drinking in the lounge
Following the neon signs.

Waiting for a roar
Looking at the mutating skyline
The city is my church
It wraps me in the sparkling twilight.

[Chorus:]
Waiting in a car
Waiting for the right time
Midnight City lyrics on ***
Waiting in a car
Waiting for the right time
Waiting in a car
Waiting for the right time
Waiting in a car
Waiting for the right time
Waiting in a car
Waiting for a ride in the dark.
                        
                    |
