                        Seems my own arrogance has knocked me off my feet again
 When you know I'm crawling to you as fast as I can
 First teach me to walk and then I'll learn to dance for you
 Like an honest clumsy clown, tripping along the way 'Cause I'm reaching for you
 But my arms aren't long enough
 And I'm running to you
 If I could go a little faster And I'm crying to you
 But I can't hear my own voice
 And I am waiting for you
 And trying not to fall asleep now 'Cause I'm clumsily dancing away this fear
 I'm stumbling closer to you
 And I am tumbling over my pride
 I will be a fool for you What are you thinking as you look down on me?
 Are you frustrated with my inconsistency
 Or intrigued that I can find the will to get back up
 Or maybe all of this is simply amusing? 'Cause I'm reaching for you
 But my arms aren't long enough
 And I'm running to you
 If I could go a little faster And I'm crying to you
 But I can't hear my own voice
 I am waiting for you
 And trying not to fall asleep now 'Cause I'm clumsily dancing away this fear
 I'm stumbling closer to you
 And I'm tumbling over my pride
 I will be a fool for you 'Cause I'm clumsily dancing away this fear
 I'm stumbling closer to you
 And I'm tumbling over my pride
 I will be a fool And I'm clumsily dancing away this fear
 I'm stumbling closer to you
 And I'm tumbling over my pride
 I will be a fool for you
