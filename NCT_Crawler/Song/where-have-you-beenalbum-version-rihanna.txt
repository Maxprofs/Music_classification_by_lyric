                        [Rihanna]
 I've been everywhere, man
 Looking for someone
 Someone who can please me
 Love me all night long
 I've been everywhere, man
 Looking for you babe
 Looking for you babe
 Searching for you babe

 Where have you been
 Cause I never see you out
 Are you hiding from me, yeah?
 Somewhere in the crowd

 [Hook]
 Where have you been, 
 All my life, all my life
 Where have you been, all my life
 Where have you been, all my life
 Where have you been, all my life
 Where have you been, all my life

 [Beat Break]

 [Rihanna]
 I've been everywhere, man
 Looking for someone
 Someone who can please me
 Love me all night long
 I've been everywhere, man
 Looking for you babe
 Looking for you babe

 Searching for you babe

 Where have you been
 Cause I never see you out
 Are you hiding from me, yeah?
 Somewhere in the crowd

 [Hook]
 Where have you been, 
 All my life, all my life
 Where have you been, all my life
 Where have you been, all my life
 Where have you been, all my life
 Where have you been, all my life

 Where have you been, all my life

 [Bridge]
 You can have me all you want
 Any way, any day
 To show me where you are tonight

 [Outro]
 I've been everywhere, man
 Looking for someone
 Someone who can please me
 Love me all night long
 I've been everywhere, man
 Looking for you babe
 Looking for you babe
 Searching for you babe
