                        Bài hát: Stay The Same - Joey Mcintyre

Don't you ever wish
You were someone else
You were meant to be
The way you are exactly

Don't you ever say
You don't like the way you are
When you learn to love yourself
You're better off by far
And i hope you'll always stay the same
Cause there's nothing about you i would change

I think that you could be
Whatever you wanted to be
If you could realize
All the dreams you have inside
Don't be afraid
If you've got something to say
Just open up your heart 
And let it show you the way

Don't you ever wish
You were someone else
You were meant to be
The way you are exactly

Don't you ever say
You don't like the way you are
When you learn to love yourself
You're better off by far
And i hope you'll always stay the same
Cause there's nothing about you i would change

Believe it in yourself
Reach down inside
The love you find will set you free

Believe it in yourself
You will come alive
Have faith in what you do
You'll make it through
Woo oh oh ... hey

Don't you ever wish
You were someone else
You were meant to be
The way you are exactly

Don't you ever say
You don't like the way you are
When you learn to love yourself
You're better off by far
And i hope you'll always stay the same
Cause there's nothing about you i would change

No there's nothing about you i would....... change
