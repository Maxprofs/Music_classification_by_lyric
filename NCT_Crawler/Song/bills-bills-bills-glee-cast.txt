                        At first we started out real cool,(cool)
Taking me places i ain'tnever been
But now your getting comfortable
Ain't doing those things that you did no more
Your slowly makin me pay for things
Your money should be handling


And now you ask to use my car (car)
Drive it all day and don't fill up the tank
And you have the audacity
To even come and step to me
And ask to hold some money from me
Until you get your check next week
(bridge)
You triflin',good for nothing type of brother
Silly me,why haven't I found another
A baller, when times get hard he's the one to help me out
insted of, a scrub like you who don't know what a man's about

(chorus2x)
can
you pay my bills
can you pay my telephone bills
can you pay my automo'bills
then maybe we can chill
I don't think you do
so you and me are through

now you been maxing out my card(card)
give me bad credit,buying gifts with my own ends
haven't paid the first bill
but you steady heading to the mall
going on shopping sprees
peprpetrating to your friends that you be ballin'



and then you use my cell phone(phone)
callin who ever that you think at home
and when the bill comes all of a sudden you be acting dumb
don't know where none of these calls come from
when your mamma's numbers here more than once
                        
                    |
