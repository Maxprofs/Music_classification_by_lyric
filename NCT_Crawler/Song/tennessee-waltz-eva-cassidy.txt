Eva Cassidy - Tennessee Waltz

I was dancin' with my darlin' 
To the Tennessee Waltz
When an old friend I happened to meet
I had a new distance to my darling 
And while they were dancing
My friends stole my sweetheart from me

I remember the night and the Tennessee Waltz
I know now just what I have lost
Yes, I lost my little darlin'
The night they were playin' 
The beautiful Tennessee Waltz

I remember the night and the Tennessee Waltz
I know now just what I have lost
Yes, I lost my little darlin' 
The night they were playin' 
The beautiful Tennessee Waltz
Oh the beautiful Tennessee Waltz
