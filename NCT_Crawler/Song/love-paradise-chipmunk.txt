You're always on my mind,
All days that all the times,
You're every thing to me, brightest star to let me see,
You touch me in my dream, we kiss in every scenes,
I pray to be with you through rain and shiny day.

[ Chorus]
I'll love you, till I die, deep as sea, wide as sky.
The beauty of our love paint rainbow everywhere we come.
Need you, all my life, you're my hope, you're my prize
In your arms i find my heaven, in your eyes my sea and sky
May life be our love paradise.
