                        Birthday Sex

Verse 1
It's yo birthday, so I know you want to ride out
Even if we only go to my house
Sip mo-eezy as we sit upon my couch
Feels good, but I know you want to cry out
You say u want passion, I think you found it
Get ready for action, don't be astounded
We switching positions, you feel surrounded
Tell me where you want your gift, girl

Chorus
Girl you know I-I-I, Girl you know I-I-I
I been feenin
Wake up in the late night
Been dreamin about your loving, girl
Girl you know I-I-I, Girl you know I-I-I
Don't need candles and cake
Just need your body to make...
Birthday sex... Birthday sex oohoohoohooh
(It's the best day of the year girl)
Birthday sex... Birthday sex oohoohoohooh
(G-spot g-spot let me hit that g-spot g-spot girl)

Verse 2
See you sexy in them jeans got me on 10
1-2-3... Think I got you pinned
Don't tap out, fight until the end
Ring that bell, and we gon start over again
We grindin with passion, 'cause it's your birthday
Been at it for hours, I know you thirsty
You kiss me so sweetly, taste just like Hershey's
Just tell me how you want you gift, girl

Chorus
Girl you know I-I-I, Girl you know I-I-I

Wake up in the late night
Been dreamin bout your loving, girl
Girl you know I-I-I, Girl you know I-I-I

Verse 3
First, I'm gonna take a dive into the water deep
Until I know I pleased that body (body)
Or girl without a broom I might just sweep you off yo feet
And make you wanna tell somebody (body) how I do
Or maybe we can float on top my waterbed (bed)
You close your eyes as I improv between your legs
We work our way from kitchens, stoves and tables
Girl, you know I'm more than able to please yeah
You say you wanted flowers on the bed (on the bed)
But you got me in hours on the bed

Chorus
Girl you know I-I-I, Girl you know I-I-I
I been feenin,
Wake up in the late night
Been dreamin bout your loving, girl
Girl you know I-I-I, Girl you know I-I-I
Don't need candles and cake
Just need your body to make...
Birthday sex... Birthday sex oohoohoohooh
(It's the best day of the year girl)
Birthday sex... Birthday sex oohoohoohooh
