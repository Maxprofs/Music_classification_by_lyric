Tiny hands
Yes, that's you
And all you've shown
It's simply true
I smell your breath
It makes me cry
I wonder how
I've lived my life

'Cause without you
How did I get through
All of my days
Without you?
Now living with you
See everything's true
My baby, it's you
My baby
My baby
My baby

In no words at all
So tiny and small
In love I fall
So deep, so deep
My precious love
Sent from above
My baby boo
Gotta thank you, gotta thank you

'Cause without you
How did I get through
All of my days
Without you?
Now living with you
See everything's true
My baby, it's you
My baby
My baby
My baby

'Cause without you
How did I get through
All of my days
Without you?
Now living with you
See everything's true
My baby, it's you
My baby, it's you
My baby
My baby
