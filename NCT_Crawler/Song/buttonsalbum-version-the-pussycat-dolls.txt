 Typical and hardly the type I fall for
 I like when the physical
 Don't leave me asking for more
 I'm a s*** mamma (Mama)
 Know just how to get what I wanna (Wanna)
 All I wanna do is spring this on ya(On ya)
 That back up all the things that I told(Told ya)

 You been sayin' all the right things all night long
 But I can't seem to get you over here to help take this off

 Baby, can't you see? (See)
 These clothes aren't fittin' on me (me)
 The heat comin' from this beat (beat)
 I'm about to blow
 I don't think you know

 You say you're a big boy
 But I can't agree
 'Cause the love you said you had
 Ain't been put on me
 I wonder[x2]
 If I'm just too much for you
 Wonder [x2]
 If my kiss don't make you just
 Wonder [x2]
 What I got next for you
 What you wanna do? (Do)

 Take a chance to recognize that this could be yours
 I can see, just like most guys that your game don't please
