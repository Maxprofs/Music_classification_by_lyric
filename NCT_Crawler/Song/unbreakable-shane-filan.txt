                        Bài hát: Unbreakable - Shane Filan

She finds it hard to trust someone
She's heard the words 'cause they've all been sung
She's the girl in the corner
She's the girl nobody loved

But I can't, I can't, can't stop thinking about you everyday
And you can't, you can't, you can't listen to what people say
They don't know you baby
Don't know that you're amazing
But I'm here to stay
I'm here to stay
Yeah

When you lose your way and the fight is gone
Your heart starts to break and you need someone around now
Just close your eyes while I put my arms around you
And make you unbreakable

She stands in the rain, just to hide it all
If you ever turn around
I won't let you fall down now
I swear I'll find your smile then put my arms around you
And make you unbreakable

'Cause she's the girl that I never had
She's the heart that I wanted bad
The song I heard on the radio
That made me stop and think of her

And I can't, I can't, I can't concentrate anymore
And I need, I need, need to show her what her heart is for
It's been mistreated badly
Now her world has started
Falling apart
Falling apart

When you lose your way and the fight is gone
Your heart starts to break and you need someone around now
Just close your eyes while I put my arms around you
And make you unbreakable

She stands in the rain, just to hide it all
If you ever turn around
I won't let you fall down now
I swear I'll find your smile then put my arms around you
And make you unbreakable

You need to know, that somebody's there, all the time
I'd wait in line and I hope it's yours
I can't walk away 'til your heart knows
That it's beautiful oh I hope you know
It's beautiful

When you lose your way and the fight is gone
Your heart starts to break and you need someone around now
Just close your eyes while I put my arms around you
And make you unbreakable

She stands in the rain, just to hide it all
If you ever turn around
I won't let you fall down now
I swear I'll find your smile then put my arms around you
And make you unbreakable
                        
                    |
