                        [Verse 1: Game]

 Tell ‘em pray for me
 It was God that brought Dre to me
 Even brought the nigga Kanye for me
 Blessed
 But them niggas shot Big
 Made a nigga feel ashamed of the city where he live
 Make a nigga hate the logo on the Dodger cap
 Thinkin’ back to that beamer
 Wish my nigga Pac was strapped, but I’m dreaming
 Las Vegas Boulevard, a fading sun, bullet scars
 Everybody King of Diamonds ‘til the Feds pull they card
 Not the deck though
 Hip-hop was better off when it was just Dre, Scarface and Esco
 Memoirs of the Gold Chain
 It’s a cold game, nigga, Johnny Coltrane
 Black Versace’s with the gold frames
 Niggas said they sold ‘cane, that’s a bold claim
 Fourteen, had a brain that could throw flames
 So strange, had to blow they mind, Cobain
 Bang!

 [Hook: Game / Kanye West]

 Mama forgive me cause I’m tryin’ to make a living
 Them niggas hatin’ cause that rose Phantom killin’
 Niggas shinin’ like they hangin’ from the ceiling
 Me and ‘Ye kill it (somethin’ like my Jesus piece)
 Lord willing, I see a billion
 ‘Til then I let my nuts hang (somethin’ like my Jesus piece)
 Throw them suicide doors up
 And let the Holy Ghost swing (somethin’ like my Jesus piece)

 [Verse 2: Game]

 That’s that crack music, nigga
 Never spit a verse ‘cause I was makin’ trap music, nigga
 I’m not an army, I’m a movement
 The flow is water, Andre tired to Ice Cube him
 Ice Cuban, roof translucent
 Chick on my side tryin’ to get my Trews loose
 When I’m talkin’ ‘bout God
 She supposed to bow her head
 Now she all on the blogs
 Steady postin’ ‘bout her head
 Got me thinkin’ like a father, is the world safe?
 Got me clingin’ to my daughter like shark fins and water rocks
 In my ear is something titanic
 This my life and it’s exactly how I planned it, damn it
 God says everything happens for a reason
 I seen four seasons at the Four Seasons
 Take that Chinchilla off, poor kids is freezing
 Cookin’ up in the same pot they ain’t got to pee in

 [Hook:]

 [Verse 3: Common]

 Pieces on gold leashes
 Cruisers around greasers make it cohesive
 I’m the son shining with God features
 Draw closer to a true blood leader
 Soul of a southern preacher
 Went from dinner with bottom feeders to world leaders
 We throw the peace up
 Knowing that the world need us
 Eagerness to live life and see the bright lights
 The sacrifices we made is sort of Christ-like
 At the after party thinkin’ what the after life’s like
 He paid for our sins, is it really price right?
 *** it, I see the light
 Broads, they see the light
 Can’t deny my Jesus piece that’s so Peter-like
 Chicks crow for dough
 Get low for more
 A combo peach she end up at the condo
 Another Jane Doe or a golden angel?
 Pending on the angle, watch the chain glow
