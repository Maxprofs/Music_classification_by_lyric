Up with it girl 
Rock with it girl

Bounce with it girl 
Dance with it girl 
Get with it girl (Bada bang bang) 

[Verse 1: Sia] 
Come on, come on, turn the radio on 
It's Friday night and I won't be long 
Gotta do my hair, I put my make up on 
It's Friday night and I won't be long 

[Pre-Chorus: Sia (Sean Paul)] 
Til I hit the dance floor (Bada bang) 
Hit the dance floor (Bada bang) 
I got all I need (Sia) 
No I ain't got cash 
No I ain't got cash 
But I got you baby 
(Just you an me) 

[Chorus: Sia + Sean Paul] 
Baby I don't need dollar bills to have fun tonight 
(I love cheap thrills) 
Baby I don't need dollar bills to have fun tonight 
(I love cheap thrills) 
But I don't need no money 
You worth more dan diamonds, more dan gold 
As long as I can feel the beat 
Mek di beat jus tek control 
I don't need no money 
You worth more dan diamonds, more dan gold 
As long as I keep dancing 
Free up yourself, get outa control 

[Verse 2: Sia] 
Come on, come on, turn the radio on 
It's Saturday and I won't be long 
Gotta paint my nails, put my high heels on 
It's Saturday and I won't be long 

[Pre-Chorus: Sia (Sean Paul)] 
Til I hit the dance floor (Bada bang) 
Hit the dance floor (Bada bang) 
I got all I need (Sia) 
No I ain't got cash 
No I ain't got cash 
But I got you baby 
(Just you an me) 

[Chorus: Sia + Sean Paul] 
Baby I don't need dollar bills to have fun tonight 
(I love cheap thrills) 
Baby I don't need dollar bills to have fun tonight 
(I love cheap thrills) 
But I don't need no money 
You worth more dan diamonds, more dan gold 
As long as I can feel the beat 
Mek di beat jus tek control 
I don't need no money 
You worth more dan diamonds, more dan gold 
As long as I keep dancing 
Free up yourself, get outa control
