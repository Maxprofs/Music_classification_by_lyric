                        Bài hát : Chouchou Musubi - Aimer

Katappo de maru wo tsukutte shikkari mottete 
Mou katappo de sono maru no ushiro wo guru tto mawatte

Aida ni dekita POKKE ni haitte dete kuru no mattete 
Dete kita tokoro wo mukae ni kite "Se-no" de hippatte

Hajime wa nanto mo nasakenai katachi dato shite mo 
Onaji dake chikara wo komete

Hane wa ookiku musubime wa kataku 
naru you ni kitsuku musunde ite hoshii no

Ude wa koko ni omoide wa tooku ni 
Oite oite hoshii hoshii no

Katappo demo hippacchaeba hodokechau kedo 
Tsukutta mono kowasu no wa haruka ni kantan dakedo

Dakedo hodoku toki mo sou, chanto onaji you ni ne 
Wakatteru yo demo dekitara ne "Se-no" de hippatte

Hodoke ya shinai you ni to negatte chikara komete wa 
Hiroge sugita hane ni tomadou

Hane wa ookiku musubime wa kataku 
naru you ni kitsuku musunde ite hoshii no

Yume wa koko ni omoide wa tooku ni 
Kizukeba soko ni aru kurai ga ii

Damatte hippattari shinai de yo bukakkou na chou ni shinai de yo 
Musunda tsumori ga hodoite itari yurumeta tsumori ga shimete itari

Kono aokute hiroi sekai ni musuu ni chirabatta naka kara 
Betsubetsu ni futari eranda ito wo otagai taguriyoseattanda

Musubareta'n ja naku musundanda futari de "Se-no" de hippattanda 
Ookiku mo chiisaku mo narisuginai you ni chikara wo kometanda

English Translation
Make a circle with one end, and hold it tight 
Then bring another end around that circle

Get it in through the pocket that formed in between, and wait till it comes out 
Come to get it when it's out, and pull with a "one, two three"

Even if in the beginning it takes on a pathetic shape, 
Give it the same amount of strength

The wings large, the knot tight 
I want you to tie it in that way

Your arm here, and our memories far away 
That's where I want you to keep them

If you pull even just one end, it'll come out undone 
And breaking something you've made is a lot more easier

But when you untie it too, do it in the same, correct way 
I know, I know, but when you're done, pull it with a "one, two, three"

Praying for it not to come out, and giving it a bit of strength 
Then being perplexed at the wings spread too wide

The wings large, the knot tight 
I want you to tie it in that way

Our dreams here, and our memories far away 
To be able to suddenly notice they're near, that's how I like it

Don't just pull it without a word, don't make it a clumsy butterfly 
Thinking it's tied, but it's untied; thinking it's loosened, but it's tightened

In this blue, wide world, among the millions scattered around 
The two of us separately picked a thread and pulled it to ourselves

The knot wasn't tied - we did it ourselves, and we both pulled it with a "one, two, three" 
So that it doesn't get too large or too small, I gave it strength
                        
                    |
