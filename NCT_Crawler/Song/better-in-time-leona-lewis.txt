                        Song: Better In Time - Leona Lewis

It's been the longest winter without you,
I didn't know where to turn to.
See, somehow I can't forget you,
After all that we've been through.

Going, coming... thought I heard a knock
Who's there? No one
Thinking that I deserve it
Now I realize that I really didn't know,

If you didn't notice, you mean everything.
Quickly I'm learning to love again,
All I know is I'm gon' be okay

[Chorus:]
Thought I couldn't live without you
It's gonna hurt when it heals too, ooh yeah
(It'll all get better in time)
And even though I really love you,
I'm gonna smile cause I deserve to
It'll all get better in time

I couldn't turn on the TV,
Without something that'll remind me
Was it all that easy
To just put aside your feelings?
If I'm dreaming, don't wanna lie,
Hurt my feelings

But that's the path
I believe in,
And I know time will heal it
If you didn't notice, well
You mean everything.
Quickly I'm learning (oooh) to love again,
All I know is I'm gon' be okay

[Chorus:]
Thought I couldn't live without you
It's gonna hurt when it heals too, ooh yeah
(It'll all get better in time)
And even though I really love you,
I'm gonna smile cause I deserve to, ooooooh
It'll all get better in time

Since there's no more you and me (no more you and me)
It's time I let you go so I can be free
And live my life how it should be. (and I know, and I know)
No matter how hard it is,
I'll be fine without you, Yes I will.

[Chorus:]
Thought I couldn't live without you
It's gonna hurt when it heals too ohhhh
It'll all get better in time ooooh
And even though I really love you
I'm gonna smile cause I deserve to (yes I do)
It'll all get better in time, woah

Thought I couldn't live without you
It's gonna hurt when it heals too, yeahh
It'll all get better in time
And even though I really love you
I'm gonna smile cause I deserve to
