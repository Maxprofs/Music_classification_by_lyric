                        Friday night you and your boys went out to eat
Then they hung out,but you came home around three
If six of ya'll went out then four of you were really cheap
'Cause only two of you had dinner
I found your credit card receipt

It's not right but it's okay
I'm gonna make it anyway
Pack your bags up and leave
Don't you dare come running back to me
It's not right but it's okay
I'm gonna make it anyway
Close the door behind you
Leave your key
I'd rather be alone than unhappy

I'm packing bags so you can leave town for a week
The phone rings then you look at me (why'd you turn and look at me)
Said it was one of your friends
Down on 54th street boy
So why did 213 show up on your caller ID
I've been through all this before
So how could you think
That I would stand around and take some more
Things are gonna change
Cause I won't be a fool anymore
That's why you have to leave
So don't turn around to see my face
There's no more tears left here for you to see

Was it really worth you going out like that - tell me
See I'm moving on and I refuse to turn back
See all of this time I thought I had somebody down for Whitney
It turns out you were making a fool of me

It's not right but it's okay
I'm gonna make it anyway
Pack your bags up and leave
Don't you dare come running back to me
It's not right but it's okay
I'm gonna make it anyway
Close the door behind you
Leave your key
I'd rather be alone than unhappy

It's not right but it's okay - [It's not right - so okay baby]
I'm gonna make it anyway [I can pay my own rent]
Pack your bags up and leave [pay my liability - take care of my babies]
Don't you dare come running back to me
It's not right but it's okay
I'm gonna make it anyway [get up and leave]
Close the door behind you
Leave your key
I'd rather be alone than unhappy

It's not right but it's okay [I'm gonna be okay, I'm gonna be alright]
I'm gonna make it anyway [I'm gonna be okay, I'm gonna be alright]
Pack your bags up and leave [I'm gonna be okay, I'm gonna be alright]
Don't you dare come running back to me
It's not right but it's okay [I'm gonna be okay, I'm gonna be alright]
I'm gonna make it anyway [I'm gonna be okay, I'm gonna be alright]
Close the door behind you [I'm gonna be okay, I'm gonna be alright]
Leave your key
I'd rather be alone than unhappy [there's no more tears left here for you to see]

It's not right but it's okay
I'm gonna make it anyway
Pack your bags up and leave
Don't you dare come running back to me
It's not right but it's okay
I'm gonna make it anyway
Close the door behind you
Leave your key
I'd rather be alone than unhappy

It's not right but it's okay
I'm gonna make it anyway
Pack your bags up and leave
Don't you dare come running back to me
It's not right but it's okay
I'm gonna make it anyway
Close the door behind you
Leave your key
I'd rather be alone than unhappy
