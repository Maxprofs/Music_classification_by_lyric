                        Bài hát: Creatures Of The Night - Hardwell, Austin Mahone

[Verse 1: Austin Mahone]
I know a place where
We can head up there
Still on the sunset, to the sky
Wave to the people
Everyone you know, up on a satellite
'Cause we go, we go
Watching cities and streets come to life
Yeah you know, you know
We're just starting, we're learning to fly

[Pre-Chorus: Austin Mahone]
Head for the stars, be who we are
Living like creatures of the night
Never grow old, stay young in our soul
Waking up 'round the daylight
And we do, what we wanna do
And we do, what we wanna do
Do what we want, be who we are

[Chorus: Austin Mahone]
Living like creatures, creatures, creatures
Of the night
Living like creatures, creatures, creatures
Of the night
Living like creatures, creatures, creatures
Of the night

[Verse 2: Austin Mahone]
Over the rainbow, chasing the shadows
You know the story's just begun
Rocking the blue jeans, jammin' to Springsteen
Baby, we're born to run
'Cause we go, we go
Watching cities and streets come to life
Yeah you know, you know
We're just starting, we're learning to fly

[Pre-Chorus: Austin Mahone]
Head for the stars, be who we are
Living like creatures of the night
Never grow old, stay young in our soul
Waking up 'round the daylight
And we do, what we wanna do
And we do, what we wanna do
Do what we want, be who we are

[Chorus 2: Austin Mahone]
Living like creatures, creatures, creatures
Of the night
Whoa, yeah
Living like creatures of the night
And we do, what we wanna do
And we do, what we wanna do
Do what we want, be who we are
Living like creatures, creatures, creatures
Of the night

[Outro: Austin Mahone]
And we do, what we wanna do
Do what we want, be who we are
Living like creatures, creatures, creatures
Of the night
