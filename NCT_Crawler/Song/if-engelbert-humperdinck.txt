                        Bài hát : If - Engelbert Humperdinck

If I were you
I would never let me go
If I were you
I would always love me so

I can't play your part in life
But I would surely walk my way
I cannot think the way you think
But I would never go away

You can trust me when I say
That I will always be for real
You can always count on me
No metter how alone you feel

If I were you
I would never let me go
If I were you
I would always love me so
If I were you

I would never..
I would always..

I can't tell you what to do
I can only hope for more
More decisions to be good
Like the way they were before

I can't dream the things you dream
Cause I would not know where to start
Life is never what is seems
when two souls are far apart

I don't wanna know
How it feels to lose a friend
And if I were you
I would never leave again

If I were you
I would never let me go
If I were you
I would always love me so
If I were you

If I were you
I would never let me go
If I were you
I would always love me so
If I were you
                        
                    |
