                        Bài hát: What Would It Take - Anderson East

What would it take
To make you love me?
What would it take
To make you love me?

Would it take flowers
Red roses from vines
Would it take diamonds
To let you know you're mine
Well, I'll take you dancing
Sweep you off your feet
What do you need
To know you're the only one, one for me

And what would it take
To make you love me?
What would it take
To make you love me?

What words can I say?
Tell me, what can I do?
Know that I am
And I'll give it to you
I could make you smile
Give you all your dreams
And I'd give everything
To make you love me
Oh, and

What would it take
To make you love me?
And what would it take
To make you love me?
Oh, what would it take?
What would it take?
It take
To make you love me?
Oh, and
What would it take
To make you love me?
And what would it take
To make you love me?
