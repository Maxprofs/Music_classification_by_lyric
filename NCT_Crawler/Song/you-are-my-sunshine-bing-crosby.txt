                        The other night dear, as I lay sleepin'
 I dreamt I held you in my arms
 When I awoke dear, I was mistaken
 And I hunged my head and cried You are my sunshine, my only sunshine
 You make me happy when skies are gray
 You'll never know dear, how much I love you
 Please don't take my sunshine away You told me once dear, that you really love me
 And no one else could come between
 But now you've left me and you love another
 You have shattered all my dreams You are my sunshine, my only sunshine
 You make me happy when skies are gray
 You'll never know dear, how much I love you
 Please don't take my sunshine away
                        
                    |
