                        Bài hát: In And Out Of Love Remix - DJ Hoàng Minh, DJ Binlion, Armin van Buuren

See the mirror in your eyes; 
See the truth behind your lies 
Your lies are haunting me 
See the reason in your eyes 
Giving answer to the why: 
Your eyes are haunting me! 

Falling in & out of love 
in love, in love 
Falling in & out of love 
your love, your love 

Falling in & out of love 
in love, in love 
Falling in & out of love 
your love, your love 

See the mirror in your eyes; 
see the truth behind your lies 
Your lies are haunting me 
see the reason in your eyes 
Giving answer to the why: 
Your eyes are haunting me! 

Falling in & out of love 
in love, in love 
Falling in & out of love 
your love, your love 

Falling in & out of love 
in love, in love 
Falling in & out of love 
your love, your love 
in love; in love; in love 

Why can't you see it? 
Why can't you feel? 
In & out of love; 
each time. 
Why can't you feel it? 
Why can't you see it? 
In & out of love; 
It keep keep runnin'; 
It keep keep fallin'; 
Let it fade away. 

Away; Away; Away; Away 
Oh Let it fade away.
                        
                    |
