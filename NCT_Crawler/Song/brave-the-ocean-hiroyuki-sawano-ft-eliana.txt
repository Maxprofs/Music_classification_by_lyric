                        Bài hát: Brave The Ocean - Hiroyuki Sawano, Eliana

Can you wait? I'll go and see what I can do 
I know why you know what she's been going through 
And when you look up to the skies 
In most worlds you think of peace like before 

To break these chains 
We must all rise from feelings of hate 
And it's blood, sweat, tears 
but no revenge should govern our fate 
That time I first realized I cared for you so 
A city below, a dance in the dark 
I must end this now, it's perfectly clear 
Before it begins, the war we all fear 

We can wait, I wanna see what I can do 
It's too late to hope that I might make it through 
And when you see the light below 
I know exactly where to go back to her 

To break these chains 
We must all rise from feelings of hate 
And it's blood, sweat, tears 
but no revenge should govern our fate 
That time I first realized I cared for you so 
A city below, a dance in the dark 
I must end this now, it's perfectly clear 
Before it begins, the war we all fear 

To break these chains 
We must all rise from feelings of hate 
And it's blood, sweat, tears 
but no revenge should govern our fate 
That time I first realized I cared for you so 
A city below, a dance in the dark 
I must end this now, it's perfectly clear 
Before it begins, the war we all fear
                        
                    |
