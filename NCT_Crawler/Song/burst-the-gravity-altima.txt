                        Bài hát: Burst The Gravity - Altima

Hate shi nai sora wo yuku mie nai tsubasa ga michibiku
Haruka kanata, bokura wo matsu
Mada minu mirai e to
Want some faster life ? (Oh yeah yeah !!) 
Giga faster speed ? (Oh yeah yeah !!) 
Tera faster stage ? (Oh yeah yeah !!) 
Now you tell me where you wanna go (Accel world !!) 

Always same kitteta
Haya sugiru day and night
Toumei na yami ni kako mare
Dare mo nita wa no naka de it was the day I found

Found you ano hi no kaze
Yure ugoita passion
And all of my past subete kimi ni au tame no process datta ne
Around you go slow

Slowly open up my eyes within the blackness
The battle field, check the squeal of wheel
Kanata kara kikoeru yokan ni
Kodou furu wasete itai kara
The beats overwrite my whole life

It’s unlimited. It’s unlimited. If I can believe myself again
Hikari no naka meza mete iku
Shinjite kureta kimi to nara
Never let it go, never lose my way koko de umare kawaru keshiki
Kizu sae ima hokori ni naru
Dakara kimi to burst the gravity

Giga speed of circuit so integrated
But now it’s “Mayday Mayday”
Against the crisis I go what a what a what a hell is my reality. 
But I got no anxiety hey Incarnation
I’ll show you at the battle field

Weakness tsuyogaru koto nare sugite itsuka
Forget how to cry
Kokoro no piece kaketa mama de sugo shita
Afraid to be a brave

Braveness yowasa wo shiru Yeah that was me
Kimi ga ima kagayaku But now I see
So beautiful sight massugu ni miageta sora
Kibou wo tsuna ide
My feeling glows more and more

More and more I wanna see the meaning of the world
The battle field, check the squeal of wheel
Make rare nai yo, mou dare nimo
Tsuranuki tai mono ga aru kara
The beats overwrite my whole life

Wanna be with you. Wanna be with you. 
Wanna be the one makes you feel alright. 
Kawashita te wo, hanasa naide
Itsuka tobi tatsu hi ga kite mo
Wanna tell you just how much I love you
Unmei ni tachi mukau kara
Kizuna yori mo tsuyoku fukaku
Toke atteku burst the gravity

The stage is moving to twilight. 
Look at the skyline it’s full of feel
The love incarnated in an unlimited power
My heart runs around. Wind is passing the silent sound
Now that I got to go. Gotta make it fast to touch the sky

Hate shinai sora wo yuku mada minu mirai wo meza shite
Oboete ite, mune no itami
Kasanaru hodo, tsuyoku omou

It’s unlimited. It’s unlimited. 
If I can believe myself again Oh yes, you can
Hikari no naka mezamete iku
Shinjite kureta kimi to nara Hey hey
Never let it go, never lose my way koko de umare kawaru keshiki
Majestic light
Kizu sae ima hokori ni naru dakara kimi to futari
Toke atteku burst the gravity
Burst the gravity

Want some faster life ? (Oh yeah yeah !!) 
Giga faster speed ? (Oh yeah yeah !!) 
Tera faster stage ? (Oh yeah yeah !!) 
Now you tell me where you wanna go (Accel world !!)
