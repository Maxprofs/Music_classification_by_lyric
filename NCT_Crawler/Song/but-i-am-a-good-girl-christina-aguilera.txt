Christina Aguilera - But I'm a Good Girl

The dress is Chanel
The shoes YSL
The bag is Dior
Agent Provocateur
My address today, LA by the way
Above Sunset Strip, the hills all the way

My rings are by Webster
It makes the heads twirl
They all say, "Darling, what did you do for those pearls?"
"What? I am a good girl!"

The age I adore, the day oh no more
Breakfast Polo Launch and pools at the shore
The Chateau for cocktails
The Courtyard at night
Downtown is for dinner
The hell is divine
You know I have found the words goin' round
They all say my feet never do touch the ground
"What? I am a good girl!"

I am a Good Girl....
uh, Ooh, ah yeah, uh!
