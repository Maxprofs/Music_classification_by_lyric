                        You Will Be Mine
Lenka

She moved in to the house next door
Said she'd never been in love before
Tried the best she could to hide herself away

But every time she turned the lights down low
He thought he heard a voice calling out so slow
Come and take me away from all this pain
And he said

I see you sitting there at the window sill
Looking for shooting stars

I wanna get closer and closer still
I wanna take over your heart
You will be mine, mine
Over time, time
You're gonna find, find
I'll make you mine, mine

Every morning when she came outside
He tried to be the one to catch her eye
But she would only turn away and hide

He started to concoct a plan
To get her to return the feelings that he had
To show her how he thought they were entwined

I see you sitting there at the window sill
Looking for shooting stars
I wanna get closer and closer still
I wanna take over your heart
You will be mine, mine
Over time, time
You're gonna find, find
I'll make you mine, mine

Little love letters written in red
Folded up, put away next to the bed, oh
Little crushed hopes every day
Waiting in the wings to spirit her away

I see you sitting there at the window sill
Looking for shooting stars
I wanna get closer and closer still
I wanna take over your heart
You will be mine mine
Over time time
You're gonna find find
I'll make you mine mine
You will be mine mine
Over time time
You're gonna find find
I'll make you mine
