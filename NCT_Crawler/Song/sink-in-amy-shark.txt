                        Bài hát: Sink In - Amy Shark

Is there a a bone in my body that's not weak for you?
Well if you find one let me know
I can still feel the way you'd hold me next to you
And I don't wanna feel it anymore

[Pre-Chorus]
But if you didn't ever touch me that way just know I know I wouldn't be the same
If you never put your love in my brain, just know I know

[Chorus]
I'm weighed down by your beautiful
Collapsing underneath your perfect
Drowning in your wonderful
And I'm letting you sink in
It's, it's almost unbearable
I'm suffering inside your magic
Love you something terrible
And I'm letting you sink in
And I'm letting you sink in

[Verse 2]
Everywhere I go I'm reminded of you, like
The bed, the bathroom floor, the bar downstairs at 2am, and
I'm trying to forget the things you used to do, like
Kiss me harder in the bar downstairs at 2am


[Pre-Chorus]
But if you didn't ever touch me that way just know I know I wouldn't be the same
If you never put your love in my brain, just know I know

[Chorus]
I'm weighed down by your beautiful
Collapsing underneath your perfect
Drowning in your wonderful
And I'm letting you sink in
It's, it's almost unbearable
I'm suffering inside your magic
Love you something terrible
And I'm letting you sink in
And I'm letting you sink in
And I'm letting you sink in

[Bridge]
You got a hold of me and I don't know how or why
You got a hold of me and I don't know how or why
You got a hold of me and I don't know how or why
You got a hold of me and I don't know how or why

[Chorus]
I'm weighed down by your beautiful
Collapsing underneath your perfect
Drowning in your wonderful
And I'm letting you sink in
It's, it's almost unbearable
I'm suffering inside your magic
Love you something terrible
And I'm letting you sink in
And I'm letting you sink in
And I'm letting you sink in
                        
                    |
