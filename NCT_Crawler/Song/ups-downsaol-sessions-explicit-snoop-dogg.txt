 Every dog has his day
 Another thirty nine inch thick classic (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
 Girl, as I sit here thinking to myself
 There is no one for you but me, and I mean that
 And I think about all the things we've been through
 Like arguing and fighting for example
 You know the love we have for each other
 It tends to out weigh what do to another
 Ya know my granddaddy use to always say
 Ya know he used to say it like this

 [Chorus:]
 There will be, ups and downs, smiles and frowns
 Share with me, fairy tales or make believe
 There will be, ups and downs, smiles and frowns
 Share with me, fairy tales or make believe
 There will be, ups and downs, smiles and frowns
 Share with me, fairy tales or make believe

 What up mother***ers? This is snoop dogg
 I'm trying to figure out how the *** I'm gonna do y'all
 Hanging with my homie from the turf, that's young q-ball
 Giving me the word from the street, heres the scoop y'all
 The niggaz from the eastsidaz split up (split up)
 And one of 'em tried to *** yo' *** up (what?)
 Naw cuz, don't believe that, that's my nigga for life
 I'm out with the bull***, I'm in wuth the real ***
 I'm at the church doing work, spittin game from the pulpit
 Now that's the bidness, and god is my witness
 L-B-C-2-1-3 hell yeah, we in this
 Its so relentless, and all my dogs up against the life sentence
 I love y'all, like I love no bitch, and that's real ***
 Or some crip ***, homie dig this

 [Chorus:]
 There will be, ups and downs, smiles and frowns
 Share with me, fairy tales or make believe
 There will be, ups and downs, smiles and frowns
 Share with me, fairy tales or make believe
 There will be, ups and downs, smiles and frowns
 Share with me, fairy tales or make believe

 I used to have a lot broads that I doont fool with
 I used to have a lot of homeboys I aint cool with
 A lotpeople that a nigga used to go to school with
 Happy as hell to see the big dog doin it
 But what none of them would believe though (what?)
 That I would be bigger the kurtis blow
 I guess he was right, these are the breaks
 Despite my mistakes and aches, I'm gettin' cake
 To realize your fate through faith, (through faith)
 Cause we all gonna get that day (for what)
 To see if our lives was straight
 And to see if we gonna walk through thosse pearly gates (yeah?)
 To see the man upstairs, on some real talk homie
 I'm tired of being stuck here
 If I could I would fly to the moon (zoom)
 Y'all probably think I'm trippin off deeze mushrooms (i know)

 [Chorus:]
 There will be, ups and downs, smiles and frowns
 Share with me, fairy tales or make believe
 There will be, ups and downs, smiles and frowns
 Share with me, fairy tales or make believe
 There will be, ups and downs,
 Smiles and frowns
 Share with me, fairy tales or make believe

 Now as I think back to the words my granddaddy used to say
 I never seen him in church, but he always had the word
 He would always tell me! Sometimes you gotta take the good with the bad
 You gotta do bad in order to do good
                        
                    |
