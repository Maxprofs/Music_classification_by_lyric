                        Bài hát: In The Name Of Love (English Version) (The Heirs OST) - Ken (VIXX)

Oh everybody call me, you call me in the name of love
Call me, you call me, tell me your love
Though there are tears, though my heart aches
I will go toward love for my heart
It hurt, it hurt so much that my heart froze
No matter how much I embrace it, it won't budge
But you moved me, your thunder like breath
I was rough but the name of love made me cry
Oh everybody call me, you call me in the name of love
Call me, you call me, tell me your love
Though there are tears, though my heart aches
I will go toward love for my heart
Sadness stayed for so long that I'm already used to it
So the happiness that came tries to run away
But you melted me, your comfort with tears held back
I was rough but you make me live but I'm afraid I'll scar you
Oh, everybody call me, you call me, shout out that you want 
Call me, you call me, so my heart can hear it
Don't hesitate, don't give up, don't forget that you're another version of me
Oh everybody call me, you call me in the name of love
Call me, you call me, tell me your love
Though there are tears, though my heart aches
I will go toward love for my heart
                        
                    |
