                        Bài hát: A Hundred Ways (Remix 2015) - Dj Tino, Ellie Lawson

You know what
Something about you
Reminds me
To get in touch with myself

And you know what
Something about you
Teaches me
To stay loyal to me

The road is long
And sometimes rough
But every step
I hear you say

There are a hundred ways to love
One hundred ways to start
Nothing can hold you back
When you're true to your heart

There are a hundred ways back home
One hundred ways to feel
Nothing can hold you back
When you're true and you're real
To your heart
                        
                    |
