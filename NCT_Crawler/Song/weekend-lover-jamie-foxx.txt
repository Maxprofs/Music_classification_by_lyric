 I know you've been waiting on this
 And I'ma give it to you

 Y'all always arguing 'bout something and

 On Thursday, and this her seventh time flaking on you
 But you look forward to Friday
 Because you know when you get home, I'm gon' be there Girl, I'm your weekend lover, you don't have to call
 I'll be at your door when you get home
 Because I'm your weekend lover, please don't answer the phone
 And whatever you got on, it's coming off, girl I'll pick you up, lay you down
 Fridays and Saturdays you need me around
 'Cause I'm your weekend lover, so go 'head and sleep in
 And I'll make sure you have a good weekend, yeah Relax now, I'ma run that bubble bath
 You can put your feet up, feet up
 Don't you worry 'bout a thing
 The baby's at your mama's house Got a hundred candles and roses
 Baby, I ain't playing no games
 Sip on this Moet mimosa, sit down on the sofa
 While I cook you a meal, ay And when we're done
 We'll go and have some fun in the bedroom
 'Cause I know you're looking forward to your Weekend lover, you don't have to call
