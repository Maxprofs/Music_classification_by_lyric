                        Bài hát: Hello Vietnam (Beat & Instrumental) - V.A

Tell me all about this name, that is difficult to say
It was given me the day i was born
Want to know about the stories of the empire of old
My eyes say more of me than what you dare to say.

All i know of you is all the sights of war
Anh film by coppola, the helicopter's roar.

One day i'll touch your soil
One day i'll finally know your soul
One day i'll come to you
To say hello vietnam.

Tell me all about my colour, my hair and my little feet
That have carried me every mile of the way.

Want to see your house, your streets show me all i do now know
Wooden sampans, floating markets, light of gold.

All i know of you is the sights of war
Anh film by coppola, the helicopter's roar.

One day i'll touch your soil
One day i'll finally know your soul
One day i'll come to you
To say hello vietnam.

And buddha's made of stone watch over me
My dreams they lead me through the fields of rice
In prayer, in the light i see my kin
I touch my free, my roots, my begin.

One day i'll touch your soil
One day i'll finally know your soul
One day i'll come to you
To say hello vietnam.

One day i'll walk your soil
One day i'll finally know my soul
One day i'll come to you
To say hello vietnam
To say hello vietnam
To say xin chào vietnam.
