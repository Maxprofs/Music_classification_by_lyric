by 
Say - say it ain’t over
'cuz my heart is crying for you
Down - deep down you know that
So can you forgive me the truth
I kept my feelings inside of me
But now I can see
Don’t wanna lose you
I’m here to stay
Did I confuse you - girl
Believe when I say
I never meant to

Hurt you that way

Here by my side

Here by my side, yeah

That you’re gonna show me the way
How can I convince you
That love is the reason to stay

But now I can see
Don’t wanna lose you

Did I confuse you - girl
Believe when I say
I never meant to

Hurt you that way
