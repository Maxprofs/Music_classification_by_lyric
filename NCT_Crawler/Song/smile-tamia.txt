                        Sometimes I sit at home and wonder how it'd be if he had loved me
Truly loved me, yes
I learned a while ago, that kind of thing, it never happens for me
And so I go around and just pretend
Love is not for me
I play the circus clown around my friends
Make them laugh and they won't see
That you never let ‘em see you sweat
Don’t want them to think the pain runs deep
Lord know its killing me

[Chorus:]
So I put on my makeup
Put a smile on my face
And if anyone asks me
Everything is ok
I’m laughing ‘cause no one
Knows the joke is on me
‘Cause I’m dying inside with my pride and a smile on my face
On my face
Singing la la la (la la, la la)
la la, ( la la, la la, la la)
la la (la la)
Ooooh (la la la laahh)
Laaaah

Sometimes I sit at home by the phone hoping he might call me (call me)
But he don't call me (call me, call me, call me)
But then I realize dreams come true
Aren't for girls like me, not like me
And so I go around with my head up
Like it ain't no thing
And when the boys around with all my friends
I’m into other things
‘Cause you never let them see you sweat
Don’t want them to think the pain runs deep
Lord knows its killing me

[Chorus:]
And so I put on my makeup (put it on, put it on)
Put a smile on my face (a smile on my face)
And if anyone asks me (oooh yeah)
Everything is ok (oh I’m laughing)
I’m laughing ‘cause no one (no one, no one)
Knows the joke is on me
But I’m dying inside with my pride and a smile on my face
On my face (oooh)

It’s not an easy (thing to do)
Sometimes it’s hard to (face the truth)
It’s not the life that I would choose
But what else can I do if he don't love me (no)
If he don't want me
I’m not about to sit around
Let myself go (gooooo)

[Chorus:]
So I put on my makeup
Put a smile on my face (I put a smile on my face)
And if anyone ask me
Everything is ok
I’m laughing ‘cause no one (no one, no one)
Knows the joke is on me
‘Cause I’m dying inside with my pride and a smile on my face
On my face
Singing, la la la (la la, la la)
la la, ( la la, la la, la la)
la la (la la, la la, la la la la laaa)
I’ll keep on singing la la
Lalalala......
