                        Bài hát:Someday We'll Know - Mandy Moore

Ninety miles outside Chicargo
I can't stop driving I don't know why
So many questions
I need an answer
Two years later
You're still on my mind.

Whatever happened to Amelia Earhart
Who holds the stars up in the sky
'Cause true love is just once in a lifetime
Did the captain of the Titanic cry ?.

[Chorus]

Someday we'll know
If love can move a mountain
Someday we'll know
Why the sky is blue
Someday we'll know
Why I wasn't meant for you.


Does anybody know the way to Atlantis ?.
What the wind says when she cries ?
I'm speeding by the place that I met you
For the ninety-seventh time tonight.

[Chorus]

Someday we'll know
If love can move a mountain
Someday we'll know
Why the sky is blue
Someday we'll know
Why I wasn't meant for you.

Someday we'll know
Why Samson loved Delilah
One day I'll go
Dancing on the moon
Someday you'll know
That I was the one for you.

I bought the ticket to the end of the rainbow
Watched the stars crash in the sea
If I can ask God, just one question
Why aren't you here with me tonight ?.

[Chorus]

Someday we'll know
If love can move a mountain
Someday we'll know
Why the sky is blue
Someday we'll know
Why I wasn't meant for you.

Someday we'll know
Why Samson loved Dalilah
One day I'll go
Dancing on the moon
Someday you'll know
That I was the one for you...
                        
                    |
