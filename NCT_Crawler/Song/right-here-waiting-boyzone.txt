                        Let it go
Don't be scared to breathe again
It's alright
Close your eyes
And together we can feel what it's like
To live again
Embrace this world and hold on tight
Until the end
You don't have to do this alone
Cause I'm right here
I'm right here standing by you
You don't have to do this alone
Cause I'm right here
I'm right here
Always for you, you [2x]
Here we go
From this moment we are born to be one
In your eyes I can see the stars
They shine on and on
So let's be strong
And let's be brave
Take my hand and lead the way
You don't have to do this alone
Cause I'm right here
I'm right here standing by you
You don't have to do this alone
Cause I'm right here
I'm right here
Always for you, you [2x]
Always for you
Together
We'll be together
Always
Always be together
And we'll be together
Always [2x]
You don't have to this alone
Cause I'm right here
I'm right here standing by you
You don't have to do this alone
Cause I'm right here
I'm right here standing by you
I'm standing by you.
