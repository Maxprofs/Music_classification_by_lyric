                        Bài hát: Good Hit(Album Version) - Jennifer Lopez 

Uno, dos, tres, cuatro

Good hit, I got that good hit
I got that good hit, I got that good hit

La la la la
La la la la
La la la la
La la la la

Can I please have your attention?!

I'm so dope from head to toe
Armed and big, I drop it low
On the ground, I put it down
Round and round yeah here we go

Push up on me, I'm on the floor
Talk up on it, make me yours

Give you my love, give me love back
Baby I'm here, where you at

Got that New York swagger, Miami bass
Got my California Loub's on, all up in your face
Yeah I'm mid-west pimp tight, Texas fire
Don't you want me to have your babies
Don't you wish I was your Boo

I got that good hit (La la la la)
Don't you wish I was your boo
I got that good hit (La la la la)
Don't you wish I was your boo
I got that good hit
Don't you wish I was your boo
I got that good hit (La la la la)
Don't you wish I was your boo
I got that good hit (La la la la)
Don't you wish I was your boo

Palms up yup call them up yup
Tell 'em that I got that gold buy me some Louis stuff
Buy me Gucci stuff yup that I Love Lucy stuff
Baby I'm a classic don't you wanna bag me

Don't you like my outfit looking all flashy
Don't you wanna love me up right in traffic?
All up in my bum bum tryin' to back back
I'm standing here where you at

Got that New York swagger, Miami bass
Got my California Loub's on, all up in your face
Yeah I'm mid-west pimp tight, Texas fire
Don't you want me to have your babies
Don't you wish I was your Boo

I got that good hit (La la la la)
Don't you wish I was your boo
I got that good hit (La la la la)
Don't you wish I was your boo
I got that good hit (La la la la)
Don't you wish I was your boo
I got that good hit (La la la la)
Don't you wish I was your boo

Baby, don't you wanna put your hands on me
On me, on me, on me, on me
Baby, I can wrap you like you can't believe
Believe, believe, believe, believe
I know you love my swagger
I know you like my style
I know you like my um-hoo
I make the boys go woah

Where you at?

Got that New York swagger, Miami bass
Got my California Loub's on, all up in your face
Yeah I'm mid-west pimp tight, Texas fire
Don't you want me to have your babies
Don't you wish I was your Boo
