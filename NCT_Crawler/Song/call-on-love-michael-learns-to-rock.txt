                        Bài hát: Call On Love - Michael Learns To Rock

You're always there
Even in my darkest days
Hey, Superman
Take a break
You give so much of yourself
But you know, even heroes need some help

If you've lost the fight
Between wrong and right
You can call on love to guide you
If you've lost your faith
Don't you be ashamed
You can call on love to find you
And love will answer
Love will answer
You can call on love

You take the fall
And no one ever sees you jump
You save a soul
and now you're numb
And the pain that's in your chest
A world is changing
But don't give up just yet

If you've lost the fight
Between wrong and right
You can call on love to guide you
If you've lost your faith
Don't you be ashamed
You can call on love to find you
And love will answer
Love will answer
You can call on love
Ooohh
Love will answer
Love will answer
You can call on love

You don't get it, doing on your own
Yeah yeah yeah
Doesn't matter where you've gone wrong
Love won't judge you

If you've lost the fight
Between wrong and right
You can call on love to guide you
If you've lost your faith
Don't you be ashamed
You can call on love to find you
And love will answer
Love will answer
You can call on love
Ooohh...
Love will answer
Love will answer
You can call on love

Love won't judge you...
