                        Bài hát: Summer All Over The World - Phineas, Cast

Hot dogs, cotton candy,
Tire swings and barbecue,
In the shade, in the sun
Ev'rywhere's a rockin' view,
As long as we're together,
Doesn't matter what we do!
Come on!
Ferb: Come on!
Phineas: Come on!
Ferb: Come on!
Phineas: Bike ridin' down a hill,
Slammin' out a screen door,
Steaks sizzle on the grill,
Waves crashin' on the shore,
It's beautiful from here
And you know you want some more!
Come on!
Ferb: Come on!
Phineas: Come on!
Ferb: Come on!
Phineas: Get ready, ev'rybody!
Band and Crowd: We're havin' a party!
Phineas: Get up on your feet...
Band and Crowd: We're havin' a party!
Phineas: And let your body feel the beat!
Band and Crowd: We're havin' a party!
Phineas: Come on and rock the curve!
All but Ferb: 'Cause it's summer, summer all over the world!
Ev'ry boy and ev'ry girl,
Jump up and say,
"Ooh! Yeah!
Ooh! Ooh! Yeah!"
Well, if not the world,
Then at least in the Northern Hemisphere
The other half is in a different time of year
But they can still say,
"Ooh! Yeah!
Ooh! Ooh! Yeah!"
Phineas: Hello, world! Welcome to our musical tribute to summer! And if you're wondering what we're doing today...
Isabella: ...we're reaching out to everyone to share our love of summer!
Baljeet: Using Ferbographic technology, we are simulcasting our virtual selves around the planet!
Phineas: To put it simply, we're joining you to celebrate around the world, all from the comfort of our own backyard!

Ev'ry corner of the world, yeah!

Band and Crowd: 'Cause it's summer, summer all over the world!
Ev'ry boy and ev'ry girl,
Jump up and say,
"Ooh! Yeah!
Ooh! Ooh! Yeah!"


Phineas: Hot dogs, cotton candy,
Tire swings and barbecue,
In the shade, in the sun
Ev'rywhere's a rockin' view,
As long as we're together,
Doesn't matter what we do!
Come on!

Well, if not the world,
Then at least in the Northern Hemisphere
The other half is in a different time of year
But they can still say,
"Ooh! Yeah!
Ooh! Ooh! Yeah!"
Bike ridin' down a hill,
Slammin' out a screen door,
Steaks sizzle on the grill,
Waves crashin' on the shore,
It's beautiful from here
And you know you want some more!
Come on!


Backup: We're havin' a party!

We're havin' a party!

We're havin' a party!

Phineas: And now help us in welcoming a very special guest and the visual metaphor for the carefree days of summer, Perry the Platypus!

(Crowd cheers, then gasps as the Perry hologram disappears)

Phineas: Hey, where's Perry?

Reprise
Phineas: Come on, ev'ryone!
Band and Crowd: We're havin' a party!
Phineas: Dancin' in the sun!
Band and Crowd: We're havin' a party!
Phineas: And you know we're not done!
Band and Crowd: We're havin' a party!
Phineas: Ev'ry corner of the world, yeah!
All: 'Cause it's summer, summer all over the world
