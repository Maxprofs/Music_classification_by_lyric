                        Bài hát: Stuck In The Middle With You - Michael Buble

Well I don't know why I came here tonight,
I got the feelin' that somethin' ain't right,
I'm so scared in case I fall off my chair,
And I'm wonderin' how I'll get down the stairs

Clowns to the left of me,
Jokers to the right,
Here I am stuck in the middle with you

Yes I'm stuck in the middle with you
And I'm wonderin' what it is I should do,
It's so hard to keep this smile from my face,
Lose control, yeah I'm all over the place

Clowns to the left of me,
Jokers to the right,
Here I am stuck in the middle with you

Well you started off with nothin'
And you're proud that you're a self-made man,
And your friends they all come crawlin'
Slap you on your back and say
Please Please
Oh!

I'm tryin' to make some sense of it all,
But I can see it makes no sense at all,
Is it cool to go to sleep on the floor?
Cause I don't think I can take it no more

Clowns to the left of me,
Jokers to the right,
Here I am stuck in the middle with you yeah

[Harmonica Jam]

Well you started off with nothin'
And you're proud that you're a self-made man
And your friends they all come crawlin'
Slap you on your back and say
Please Please

Well I don't know why I came here tonight,
I got the feelin' that somethin' ain't right,
I'm so scared in case I fall off my chair,
I keep wonderin' how I'll get down the stairs

Clowns to the left of me,
Jokers to the right,
Here I am stuck in the middle with,
Stuck in the middle with,
Stuck in the middle with you,

[Fade out]
Oh now!
Well I'm stuck in the middle with you,
Yeah stuck in the middle with you,
Oh here I am stuck in the middle with you,
Here I am stuck in the middle with you,
Stuck in the middle with you
