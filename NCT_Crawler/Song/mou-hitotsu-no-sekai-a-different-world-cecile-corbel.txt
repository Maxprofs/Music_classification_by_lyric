                        Look up at the sky if you feel lonely
This is the same sky I stare at too
I remember the day  your eyes fell on me
So shining eyes  now I'm wondering

Why are you sad?
You knew I had to leave
'Cause I live in a different world
Sill I'm not so far away from you

I feel so small down in the garden
My mind is restless when I think of you
We're so alike and so different
Not only friends so promise me

Please don't be sad
Although it's time to leave
If this is true love
Please save a place in your heart for me
                        
                    |
