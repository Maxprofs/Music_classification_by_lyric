Fergie - Pedestal

Your pedestal is falling down,
falling down, falling down
Your pedestal is falling down,
da da da da da da
[Verse 1:]
Record sales are on the mark
Cuz thats about the time the rumors start
Where all the people talking out their ass
Well, someone\'s gotta school ya
cause ya got no class
Well I\'ve paid my dues
I\'m a seasoned dame
So why you gotta throw salt in my game
You hide behind computer screens
so that you dont have to be seen
How could a person be so mean

[chorus:]
Who are you-and what do you do
that makes you think you are above me
But have you walked in my shoes
The pedestal you put yourself on
Well since I\'m breaking it down now
It\'s gonna collapse and be gone

[verse 2]
Probably one of them tag a longs
down 4 the free t-shirt
Cuz you\'re a hanger on
You think you got my figured out
Never met me have no clue what I\'m about
Maybe I got things you wish you had
You need to stop the hate and get a pen and pad
I work around the clock,
so fill your mouth up with a sock
And get your head up off your jock

Tell me who you are and what your background is
Tell me how you\'re feelin\'
when you listen to this

[chorus]
Who are you-and what do you do
that makes you think you are above me
But have you walked in my shoes
The pedestal you put yourself on
Well since I\'m breaking it down now
It\'s gonna collapse and be gone

[Bridge:]
Your pedestal is falling down,
falling down, falling down
Your pedestal is falling down,
dum dum dum dum
Your pedestal is falling down,
falling down, falling down
Your pedestal is falling down,
da da da da da da
Tell me who you are and what your background is
Tell me how you\'re feelin\'
when you listen to this
You think I don\'t see you on the internet,
I read it, don\'t think I won\'t forget

[chorus] [x2]
Who are you-and what do you do
that makes you think you are above me
But have you walked in my shoes
The pedestal you put yourself on
Well since I\'m breaking it down now
It\'s gonna collapse and be gone
