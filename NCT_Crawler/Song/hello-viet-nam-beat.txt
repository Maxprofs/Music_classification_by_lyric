                        Bài hát: Hello Việt Nam - Beat

Tell me all about this name, that is difficult to say.
It was given me the day I was born.

Want to know about the stories of the empire of old.
My eyes say more of me than what you dare to say.

All I know you is all the sights of war.
A film by Coppola, the helicopter's roar

One day I'll touch your soil
One day I'll finally know your soul
One day I'll come to you
To say hello...Vietnam

Tell me all about my colour,my hair and my little feet
That have carried me every mile of the way

Want to see your house,your street.Show me all I do not know
Wooden shampans, floating markets,light of gold

All I know you is all the sights of war
A film by Coppla, the helicopter's roar

One day I'll touch your soil
One day I'll finally know your soul
One day I'll come to you
To say hello...Vietnam

And Buddha's made of stone watch over me
My dreams they lead me through the fields of rice
In prayer,in the light...I see my kin
I touch my free, my roots, my begin

One day I'll toch your soil
One day I'll finally know your soul
One day I'll come to you
To say hello...Vietnam

One day I'll walk your soil
One day I'll finally know my soul
One day I'll come to you
To say hello...Vietnam
To say hello...Vietnam
To say xin chao...Viatnam
