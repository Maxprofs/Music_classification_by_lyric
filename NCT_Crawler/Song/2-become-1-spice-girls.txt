                        Bài hát : 2 Become 1 - Spice Girls

Candlelight and soul forever
Dream of you and me together
Say you believe it say you believe it
Free your mind of doubt and danger
be for real don't be a stranger
We can achieve it we can achieve it
Come a little bit closer baby get it on get it on
'cause tonight is the night when 2 become 1

I need some love like I've never needed love before
Wanna make love to ya baby
I had a little love now I'm back for more
Wanna make love to ya baby
Set your spirit free, it's the only way to be
Silly games that you were playing
Empty words we both were saying
Let's work it out boy, let's work it out boy
Any deal that we endeavor
boys and girls feel good together
Take it or leave it, take it or leave it
Are you as good as I remember baby? Get it on, Get it on
'cause tonight, is the night,when 2 become 1

I need some love like I've never needed love before
Wanna make love to ya baby
I had a little love, now I'm back for more
Wanna make love to ya baby
Set your spirit free, it's the only way to be
Be a little bit wiser baby, put it on, put it on
'cause tonight is the night when 2 become 1

I need some love like I've never needed love before
Wanna make love to ya baby
I had a little love, now I'm back for more
Wanna make love to ya baby
I need some love like I've never needed love before
Wanna make love to ya baby
I had a little love, now I'm back for more
Wanna make love to ya baby
Set your spirit free, it's the only way to be
