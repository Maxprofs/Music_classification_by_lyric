                        Candle light and soul forever
 A dream of you and me together
 Say you believe it, say you believe it Free your mind of doubt and danger
 Be for real, don't be a stranger
 We can achieve it, we can achieve it Come a little bit closer
 Baby, get it on, get it on
 'Cause tonight is the night when 2 become 1 I need some love like I never needed love before
 (Wanna make love to ya, baby)
 I had a little love, now I'm back for more
 (Wanna make love to ya, baby)
 Set your spirit free, it's the only way to be Silly games that you were playing
 Empty words we both were saying
 Let's work it out, boy, let's work it out, boy Any deal that we endeavor
 Boys and girls feel good together
 Take it or leave it, take it or leave it Are you as good as I remember
 Baby, get it on, get it on
 'Cause tonight is the night when 2 become 1 I need some love like I never needed love before
 (Wanna make love to ya, baby)
 I had a little love, now I'm back for more
 (Wanna make love to ya, baby)
 Set your spirit free, it's the only way to be Oh whoa, oh whoa Be a little bit wiser
 Baby, put it on, put it on
 'Cause tonight is the night when 2 become 1 I need some love like I never needed love before
 (Wanna make love to ya, baby)
 I had a little love, now I'm back for more
 (Wanna make love to ya, baby) I need some love like I never needed love before
 (Wanna make love to ya, baby)
 I had a little love, now I'm back for more
 (Wanna make love to ya, baby)
 Set your spirit free, it's the only way to be It's the only way to be
 It's the only way to be
