                        2 Become 1
Spice Girls

Candle light and soul forever
A dream of you and me together
Say you believe it
Say you believe it
Free your mind of doubt and danger
Be for real Don't be a stranger
We can acheive it
We can acheive it
Come a little bit closer baby
Get it on
Get it on
Cuz tonight
Is the night
When 2 become 1
I need some love like I never needed love before
Wanna make love to you baby
Had a little love
Now I'm back for more
Wanna make love to you baby
Set your spirit free
Its the only way to be
Silly games that you were playing Empty words we both be saying
Lets work it out boy
Lets work it out boy
Any deal that we endevour
Boys and girls go good together
Take it or leave it
Take it or leave it
Are you as good as I remember baby
Get it on
Get it on
Cuz tonight
Is the night
When 2 become 1
I need some love like I never needed love before
Wanna make love to you baby
Had a little love
Now I'm back for more
Wanna make love to you baby
Set your spirit free
Its the only way to be

Be a little bit wiser baby
Put it on
Put it on
Cuz tonight
Is the night
When 2 become 1
I need some love like I never needed love before
Wanna make love to you baby
Had a little love
Now I'm back for more
Wanna make love to you baby
I need some love like I never needed love before
Wanna make love to you baby
Had a little love
Now I'm back for more
Wanna make love to you baby
Set your spirit free
Its the only way to be
Its the only way to be
Its the only way to be......
