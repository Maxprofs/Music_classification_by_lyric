What’s happenin, baby? What’s good tonight?
I’d rather show you than tell you
What’s on my mind
Just clear out your schedule
Cause I need some time
I know you got is to do but baby tonight
Don’t be selfish with your body baby
This what I’ve been wanting baby
So let’s get together, you set the time
Just know when you get the embodied’s on my mind
Just bring it over here, trink your phone off
Leave them heels on, take your clothes off
Don’t wanna see no one else, girl I’m all yours tonight, tonight

[Chorus:]
Sex ain’t never felt better
I wanna swim in it all night
Girl your body belongs to me,
Belongs to me
I want my hands tattoed on your body baby
Sex ain’t never felt better
I wanna swim in it all night
Girl your body belongs to me,
Belongs to me
I’ll be your sex slave
Sex ain’t never felt better, babe

Let’s make a movie, you steal the show
You can be my leading lady baby anything goes
But the bed be the set, cause I know you on some freak ***
Girl I really like what you be doing
So cancel all your plans
Cause tonight anything goes baby
Make your way over here
Don’t you keep me waiting too long for that body
Bring it over here, turn your phone off
Leave them heels on, take your clothes off
Don’t wanna see no one else, girl I’m all yours tonight, tonight

[Chorus:]
Sex ain’t never felt better
I wanna swim in it all night
Girl your body belongs to me,
Belongs to me
I want my hands tattoed on your body baby
Sex ain’t never felt better
I wanna swim in it all night
Girl your body belongs to me,
Belongs to me
I’ll be your sex slave
Sex ain’t never felt better, babe

I know what you’re looking for, oh
You ain’t gotta search no more, oh
Baby let me run the show
Hold on, it’s a bumpy ride so don’t let go
All for me to lean, once you start to ride on
That was made for me, let me kick the lights on
Just so I can see, the body begging me for more
And it’s better on the floor

[Chorus:]
Sex ain’t never felt better
I wanna swim in it all night
Girl your body belongs to me,
Belongs to me
I want my hands tattoed on your body baby
Sex ain’t never felt better
I wanna swim in it all night
Girl your body belongs to me,
Belongs to me
I’ll be your sex slave
Sex ain’t never felt better, babe
                        
                    |
