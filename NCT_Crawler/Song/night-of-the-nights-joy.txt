                        [1]:
This would be the night of the nights
To satisfy the dream of my dreams
Dancing with the queen of my heart
The night away

She's dancing in a ballet to total to my heart
Moving her body to the flashing light
I never had the courage to ask her for a date
I was afraid that she would laugh at me
But when I closed my eyes I could see
How she was dancing in my dreams
Where she was dancing just for me

[chorus]:

[2]:
Oh this would be the night of the nights
To satisfy the dream of my dreams
Dancing with a queen of my heart the night away
This would be the night of the nights
To satisfy the dream of my dreams
Dancing with the queen of my heart the night away

I watched her from a distance and on her way to school
I sat behind her in the morning train
Although I'm not a coward I didn't take my chance
When we got out I lost her in a crowd
And when I close my eyes I can see
How she is dancing in my dreams
Where she is dancing just for me

[chorus] :

[repeats and fade]
                        
                    |
