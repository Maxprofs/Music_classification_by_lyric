                        Bài hát: Always (Descendants Of The Sun OST) (English Cover) - V.A

I reach out my hands and touch the sky,
with your fingers interlocking mine.
All these littlest things keep showing up,
in my dreams.

Your eyes speak so much when you give me the look,
when you say you love my lips.
When you kiss my hands, it just feels so real.

I love you, these words I cannot say.
Only you can take my breath away.
One day we’re far apart, I’ll miss you each day,
whenever, wherever you are.

Love is when I keep going back to memories,
to find you there smiling at me.
How could the silly me not realize?

That I love you, these words I cannot say.
Only you can take my breath away.
One day we’re far apart, I’ll miss you each day,
whenever, wherever you are.

I know it’s crazy to wish for you and me.
Why do I keep wandering around my own fantasies?
I close my eyes and scream your name hoping you could hear...

I love you, these words I’ll never say,
but only you, you take my breath away.
One day we’re far apart, I’ll miss you, I’ll do,
whenever, wherever you are.
Whenever, wherever.... you are....
