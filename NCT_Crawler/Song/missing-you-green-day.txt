                        Title: Missing You
Artist: Green Day

Waking up feeling naked
In my clothes inside a room that’s vacant
Lost my nerve, it’s unnerving
I know there is something I’m forgetting

I searched the moon I lost my head
I even looked under the bed
I punched the walls, I hit the street
I’m pounding the pavement looking

I’m missing you
I’m missing you
You’re not around
And I’m a complete disaster
I’m missing you

Remember was the first time
Told you I loved you at the bus station
Don’t forget ‘cause it’s not over
I’m not lost ‘cause I’m just missing you

I searched the moon I lost my head
I even looked under the bed
I punched the walls, I hit the streets
I’m pounding the pavement looking

I’m missing you
I’m missing you
You’re not around
And I’m a complete disaster
I’m missing you

Say hey!

She’s my blood
She’s my soul
I get so lost out in the cold

Feel so far
Like this lone star
It gets so hard when I’m missing you

I’m missing you
I’m missing you
You’re not around
And I’m a *** disaster
I’m missing you
