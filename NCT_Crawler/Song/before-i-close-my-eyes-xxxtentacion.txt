                        Bài hát: Before I Close My Eyes - Xxxtentacion

[Refrain]
Before I lay me down to sleep
I pray the Lord my soul to keep
I hope it's not too late for me, whoa
Before I lay me down to sleep
I pray the Lord my soul to keep
I hope it's not too late for me, whoa

[Verse]
Difference, changing in the distance
Time consumes the image, oh
Difference, changing in the distance
Time consumes our image, whoa

[Refrain]
Before I lay me down to sleep
I pray the Lord my soul to keep
I hope it's not too late for me, whoa
Before I lay me down to sleep
I pray the Lord my soul to keep
I hope it's not too late for me, whoa
                        
                    |
