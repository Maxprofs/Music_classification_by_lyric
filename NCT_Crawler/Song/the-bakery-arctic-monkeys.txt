                        Bài hát: The Bakery - Arctic Monkeys

I wish you would have smiled in the bakery
Or sat on a tatty settee
At a mutual friends gathering
And the more you keep on looking, the more it's hard to take
Love we're in stalemate
To never meet to surely where we're bound
There's one in every town
Just there to grind you down

I wish I would have seen you in the post office
Or maybe I did and I missed it
Too busy with the mind in clever lines
Why not the rounders pitch or the canteen
You're slacking love where have you been?
Just have to go and wait until tonight

(To give me the invite
don't worry it's alright)

I wish I would have seen you down in the arcade
Sippin' on a lemonade
In a paper cup and chewin' on a straw

And I wish I would have seen you in the bakery
But if I'd seen you in the bakery
You probably wouldn't have seen me.
