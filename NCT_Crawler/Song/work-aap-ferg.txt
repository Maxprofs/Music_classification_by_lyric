                        Bài hát: Work - ASAP Ferg

I gotta close the window before I record
Cause New York don't know how to be quiet
Stand up! Ferg... AR~! AR~! AR~!

Gucci, down, to the, socks, like I'm, Biggie poppa (BAAABY~!)
Keep your girl head in my Tommy boxers
But really though, she a silly ho, cause you know the Fergenstein getting plenty dough
She don't get nothin' from a nigga though; all she get is hard dick and some Cheerios
Kinda silly though, but I'm lyrical, bet I put him in the dirt with the penny loafs
No tint though, on my window, so you see a nigga shining in the Benzo

BALLIN'! (Skkrrrrr!) Got me feelin' like Jim Jones
I'm a pimp though, no limp though, couldn't copy my style in Kinkos
Put in work, run up on a killer then I put him in the dirt
Run up in the buildin', semi gon' squirt, that's what a nigga get when they gettin' on my nerves
I ain't lyin' - lay 'em on the curb, ridin' on a killer who be coming at Ferg!

(Damnnnnnnnn!) Girl you twerk, twerk that kitty girl make it purr
Put in work, Flacko put 'em in the dirt
French got the shovel he gon' put him in the earth, Trinidad maniac with a all gold hearse
Yeah, uh, put in work, Schoolboy Q with a pound of the purp
So much work he'll smoke up the Earth - Polo Ground, A$AP World
