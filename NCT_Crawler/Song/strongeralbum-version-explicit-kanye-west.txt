                        Work it, make it, do it, 
 Makes us harder, better, faster, stronger! 

 [Played in background, continuously:]
 Work it harder, make it better, 
 Do it faster, makes us stronger, 
 More than ever, never over, 
 Our work is never over.

 [Chorus:]
 N-now th-th-that that don't kill me
 Can only make me stronger
 I need you to hurry up now
 'Cause I can't wait much longer
 I know I got to leave right now
 'Cause I can't get much wronger
 Man I've been waitin' all night now
 That's how long I've been on you

 I need you right now
 I need you right now

 Let's get lost tonight
 You could be my black Kate Moss tonight
 Play secretary, I'm the boss tonight
 And you don't give a *** what they all say right?
 Awesome, the Christian and Christian Dior
 Damn, they don't make 'em like this anymore
 I ask 'cause I'm not sure
 Do anybody make real *** anymore?
 Bow in the presence of greatness
 'Cause right now thou has forsaken us
 You should be honored by my lateness
 That I would even show up to this fake ***
 So go ahead go nuts go ape ***
 Especially in my pastel on my ape ***
 Act like you can't tell who made this
 New gospel homey, take six, and take this, haters

 [Chorus:]

 I need you right now
 I need you right now

 Me likey

 I don't know if you got a man or not, 
 If you made plans or not
 God put me in the plans or not
 I'm trippin' this drink got me sayin' a lot
 But I know that God put you in front of me

 So how the hell could you front on me?
 There's a thousand you's, there's only one of me
 I'm trippin', I'm caught up in the moment right?
 This is Louis Vuitton Don night
 So we gonna do everything that Kan like
 Heard they'd do anything for a Klondike
 Well I'd do anything for a blonde-dike
 And she'll do anything for the limelight
 And we'll do anything when the time's right
 Ugh, baby, you're makin' it (harder, better, faster, stronger)

 [Chorus:]

 I need you right now
 I need you right now

 You know how long I've been on you?
 Since Prince was on Apollonia
 Since oj had Isotoners
 Don't act like I never told you [x6]
 Baby, you're making it (harder, better, faster, stronger)

 [Chorus:]

 I need you right now [x4]

 You know how long I've been on you?
 Since Prince was on Apollonia
 Since oj had Isotoners
 Don't act like I never told you
 Never told you [x4]

 Never over [x8]
