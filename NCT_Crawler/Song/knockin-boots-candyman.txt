                        Attention, all the ladies
 The Candyman is on the prowl
 And for those that wanna get busy
 You've gots to speak up now

 This rhyme, this time
 Is one of a kind
 Blowing your mind
 Like only the Candyman can

 Like a heavyweight champion
 Knocking em out
 Another bout without a doubt
 Once again you can scream and shout
 When I rock, the belles
 Yell out my name

 This is what you've been missing
 Listen to my heart beat
 While I'm whispering
 I know you're suffering

 So sweet
 A Candyman sweet nothings
 Hugging and tugging and rubbing
 Loving it all, having a ball

 All ya'll girlies next to me
 Talking s** to me
 We can't do that yet
 But I bet we'll chill

 Candyman, tell em the truth
 We'll still end up knocking the boots

 Ooh, boy, I love you so
 Never, ever, ever gonna let you go
 Once I get my hands on you

 At each and every show
 There's this groupie
 Honest knows what
 She wants to do to me

 She knows my name
 Knows every rap routine
 But how'd she get in my limousine

 Don't act a fool, don't drool
 I'm just a performer
 I was cool but the room got warmer
 Norma cornered me in
 Her and a friend named Lynn

 Then they checked me in
 To the Holiday Inn
 I didn't let'em win
 Said my pockets was thin

 She blew me a kiss
 I knew she wasn't new to this
 I didn't want to
 But the devil made me do it

 To the tic-toc, you don't stop
 We knock boots til six o'clock
 As we lay all night long
 And early in the morning
 She sang this song

 Ooh, boy, I love you so
 Never, ever, ever gonna let you go
 Once I get my hands on you
 Ooh, boy, I love you so
 Never, ever, ever gonna let you go
 I hope you feel the same way too
 (Girl, I do)

 Tunnel of love is what I'm entering
 When I mention it, you're surrending
 Giving it up like a good girl has to
 Living it up

 Eventually you ask to stay
 You're gonna pay for this
 Just rest your breasts on my chest
 Yes, I'm impressed

 With the way you cold love me down
 I don't wanna sit down
 I just wanna get down
 I'm on the ground, down on my knees
 Like James Brown singing Please, Please

 Round two, I'm down to
 Do what it takes to make you
 Understand I'm the Candyman
 And I melt in your mouth
 Not in your hands

 Hard as rock, yes
 I'm no sucka
 The boots I knock
 Make me one bad mother...

 Knocking while I'm hip-hopping
 Many people say my lyrics are shocking
 Just because of the simple subject
 Everyone should love this
 Cause everybody does it

 Whether they admit it
 Or if they deny it
 You betta keep quiet or else you
 Might have to see a few skeletons
 But, girl, that's irrevelent

 Break out the bottle of Austi Spumante
 Pop off the top and rock with my posse
 Fila Al, Big Dill, and D Fly
 We ask the questions
 You give the reply

 Mc Chip, Big Rob and Bud
 Rocking on the waterbed
 Knocking on the rug
 I'm just playing
 What I'm saying ain't I'll
 Girl, you should know I'm real
                        
                    |
