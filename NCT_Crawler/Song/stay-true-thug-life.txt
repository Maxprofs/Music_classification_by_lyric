                        Yeah nigga, drop the top on your muthafuckin' ride
 This how we do it on the West Coast baby Rollin' down the Four O Five
 Gettin' high
 White boys done wrecked their ***
 Tryin' to check my ride I ain't being bootsy
 Crusin' in a Six-o Impala
 Drivin' like I'm in a Hooptee
 Car full of ballin' caps Keep yo hand on the strap
 And take all the craps
 Niggas know my steel-lo, all legit
 But I'm drapped like a nigga movin' kilo *** don't stop
 'Cuz I can make that ass drop
 Make the front pop
 And hit the three wheel motion All day
 Hit the freeway
 Take it easy, uhh
 Let's slide And pick-up some hoochies
 Ride right back to the movies
 High talking back to the screen drinkin' liquor
 Havin' big dreams of gettin' richer, I'm livin' that Thug Life, y'all know the rules
 Gotta do whatcha gotta do, stay true, yeah
 Thug Life, y'all know the rules
 Gotta do whatcha gotta do, stay true, uhh Thug Life, y'all know the rules
 Gotta do whatcha gotta do, stay true, yeah
 Thug Life, y'all know the rules
 Gotta do whatcha gotta do, stay true Big Stretch represent the real nigga
 Flex, Live squad and this muthafucker catch wreck Thug Life, sharp as a roughneck
 Shakin' the dice, we roll long, ain't nothin' nice
 So the vice wanna follow us around
 Got 'em runnin' as we clown thru the town Another one, had to throw another gun
 Don't need another case, you can see it on my face son
 But I ain't fallin' yet
 And I gotta give a shout to where my ball is at Mophreme Tell 'em why the hoes dream
 Gettin' high off a nigga like a dope fiend
 'Cuz I'm non-stop, and I'm always hustlin'
 Twenty four seven, ain't nothin' buck But when a young G's flippin' keys for a livin'
 Try to make a mill off the time I'm givin'
 Trippin', mad, I'm crazy, can't nobody fade me
 And I been goin' insane lately And everybody tryin' ta hold me back
 I'm about to snap
 You better move back
 You know I led a Thug Life, y'all know the rules
 Gotta do whatcha gotta do, stay true
 Thug Life, y'all know the rules
 Gotta do whatcha gotta do, stay true Thug Life, y'all know the rules
 Gotta do whatcha gotta do, stay true
 Thug Life, y'all know the rules
 Gotta do whatcha gotta do, stay true Man, I don't worry about the Five-O
 If they start 'cuz it's all about survival
 Just stay smart, keep your mind on your bank roll
 Always stay ahead of these stank hoes these days It's an all out rat race
 And look at me just caught another cat case
 That makes three
 My laywers getting cash up the ass Don't even ask, why I'm buck wild?
 Don't smile, don't laugh
 To the young G's comin' up, peep game
 Don't let the money make you change or act strange Stay broke, it's all in together now
 Keep pumping loud till the crowd bring the top down
 Is that Tupac Thug Life ? Hell yeah
 Try to dirty up my name but it's still here Which way do I turn?
 I'm strapped
 Lost in the storm
 I can't turn back with that Thug Life, y'all know the rules
 Gotta do whatcha gotta do, stay true
 Thug Life, y'all know the rules
 Gotta do whatcha gotta do, stay true Thug Life, y'all know the rules
 Gotta do whatcha gotta do, stay true
 Thug Life, y'all know the rules
 Gotta do whatcha gotta do, stay true
