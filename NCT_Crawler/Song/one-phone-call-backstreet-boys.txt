                        Bài hát: One Phone Call - Backstreet Boys

Hard to believe it, it's almost a year since I've got to hold ya, head on my shoulder
Dodging the daylight, taking the blame I
It's all I've got left so lately I've spent
Every single night like its 25 to life
and this sentence I've been living is alone and unforgiven
Im guilty as charged cause I went and broke your heart
But even I got right, you're always gonna be my one, always be my one phone call
All I want, all I need is one phone call
Im gonna leave my message at the tone
Begging pretty baby please come home
Cause you're my one, always be my one phone call

First time it rings I cant help but think of first time I saw you, that moment I knew
Holding the phone tight,
 I hear the tone twice
If u just pick up, 
swear I can fix us
Every single night like its 25 to life
and this sentence I've been living is alone and unforgiven
Im guilty as charged
cause I went and broke your heart
But even I've got rights,
 you're always gonna be my one, always be my one phone call
All I want, all I need is one phone call
Im gonna leave my message at the tone
Begging pretty baby please come home
Cause you're my one, always be my one phone call
So let me make my case that way you wont erase
the message that Im leaving for u now
But if u do at least u knew
Cause you're my one, always be my one phone call
All I want, all I need is one phone call
Im gonna leave my message at the tone
Begging pretty baby please come home
Cause you're my one, always be my one phone call
You'll always be my one
Cause you're my one, always be my one phone call
You're always be my one phone call...
