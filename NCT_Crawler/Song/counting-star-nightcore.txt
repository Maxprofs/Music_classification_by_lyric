                        Bài hát: Counting Star - Nightcore

Lately, I've been, I've been losing sleep
Dreaming about the things that we could be
But baby, I've been, I've been praying hard

Said no more counting dollars
We'll be counting stars
Yeah we'll be counting stars

I see this life, like a swinging vine
Swing my heart across the line
And in my face is flashing signs
Seek it out and ye' shall find

Old, but I'm not that old
Young, but I'm not that bold
And I don't think the world is sold
On just doing what we're told

And I feel something so right
Doing the wrong thing
And I feel something so wrong
Doing the right thing

I couldn't lie, couldn't lie, couldn't lie
Everything that kills me makes me feel alive
Lately, I've been, I've been losing sleep
Dreaming about the things that we could be

But lately, I've been, I've been praying hard
Said no more counting dollars
We'll be,We'll be counting stars
Yeah we'll be counting stars (Yeah)

I feel the love and I feel it burn
Down this river, every turn
Hope is our four-letter word
Make that money, watch it burn

Old, but I'm not that old
Young, but I'm not that bold
And I don't think the world is sold
On just doing what we're told

And I feel something so wrong
Doing the right thing (wo)
I could lie, could lie, could lie
Everything that drowns me makes me wanna fly

Lately, I've been, I've been losing sleep
Dreaming about the things that we could be
But lately, I've been, I've been praying hard
Said no more counting dollars

We'll be,we'll be counting stars
Lately, I've been, I've been losing sleep
Dreaming about the things that we could be

But baby, I've been, I've been praying hard
Said no more counting dollars
We'll be, we'll be counting stars
Yeah we'll be counting stars (Wooo)

Lately, I've been, I've been losing sleep
Dreaming about the things that we could be
But lately, I've been, I've been praying hard
Said no more counting dollars
We'll be, we'll be counting stars

Lately, I've been, I've been losing sleep
Dreaming about the things that we could be
But baby, I've been, I've been praying hard
Said no more counting dollars
We'll be, we'll be counting stars
