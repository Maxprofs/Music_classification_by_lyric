                        Bài hát: Young Again - Hardwell, Chris Jones

When I was a boy,
I dreamed of a place in the sky
Playing in the fields
Battling with my shields
Bows made out of twine

I wish I could see this world again
Through those eyes
See the child in me
In my fantasy
Never growing old

Will we ever feel young again?
Will we ever feel young again?
Will we ever feel young again?
We wanna feel young
We wanna feel YOUNG AGAIN!

When I was a boy,
I searched for a world that's unknown
All we have is fun
Everybody run until the sun goes down
I wish I could see this world again
Through those eyes
See the child in me
In my fantasy
Never growing old

Will we ever feel young again?
Will we ever feel young again?
Will we ever feel young again?
We wanna feel young
We wanna feel YOUNG AGAIN!
