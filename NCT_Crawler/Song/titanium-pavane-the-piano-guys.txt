                        Bài hát: Titanium / Pavane - The Piano Guys, Tyler Ward

You shout it loud
But I can't hear a word you say
I'm talking loud not saying much
I'm criticized but all your bull is brick of shame
You shoot me down, but I get up

[Chorus]
I'm bulletproof nothing to lose
Fire away, fire away
Brick of shame, take your rain
Fire away, fire away
You shoot me down but I won't fall
I am titanium
You shoot me down but I won't fall
I am titanium
I am titanium...

C ut me down
But is you who had offered there to fall
Ghost town, haunted love
Raise your voice, sticks and stones may break my bones
I'm talking loud not saying much

[Chorus]
I' m bulletproof nothing to lose
Fire away, fire away
Brick of shame, take your rain
Fire away, fire away
You shoot me down but I won't fall
I am titanium
You shoot me down but I won't fall
I am titanium
I am titanium...

S tone-hard, machine gun
Firing at the ones who rise
Stone-hard, thus bulletproof

[Chor us]
You shoot me down but I won't fall
I am titanium
You shoot me down but I won't fall
I am titanium
You shoot me down but I won't fall
I am titanium
You shoot me down but I won't fall
I am titanium.
