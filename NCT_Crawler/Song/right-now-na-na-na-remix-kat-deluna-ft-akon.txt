                        Sleepless night
All that I could think about was us
And the way that only you know how to touch me
I try to move on
But I know I`m just fooling myself
Don`t wanna be kissed,touched,loved
Or give my heart to someone else

I wanna make up ... na na na
But before we make up ... na na na
Promise me you`ll never do it again
Tell me that we`ll make it through to the end

I wanna make up ... na na na na na
But before we make up ... na na na na na
Promise me you`ll never do it again
Tell me that we`ll make it through to the end

Girl I know mistakes were made between us to
And we show our eyes that night even said some things weren`t true
Why`d you go and haven`t seen my girl since then
Why can`t it be the way it was
You were my homie, lover and friend

I wanna make up ... na na na
But before we make up ... na na na
Promise me you`ll never do it again
Tell me that we`ll make it through to the end

I wanna make up ... na na na na na
But before we make up ... na na na na na
Promise me you`ll never do it again
Tell me that we`ll make it through to the end

Don`t lie (Don`t lie)
Promise everyday you`re gonna try (Try)
To make me feel like everything`s alright (Make me feel alright)
Like I`m the apple of your eye (Of your eye)

I wanna make up ... na na na
But before we make up ... na na na
Promise me you`ll never do it again
Tell me that we`ll make it through to the end

I wanna make up ... na na na na na
But before we make up ... na na na na na
Promise me you`ll never do it again
Tell me that we`ll make it through to the end

I wish I could fly with you
I wish I could lie with you (Lie with you)
I just wanna dine with you (Dine with you)
Get on my grind with you
                        
                    |
