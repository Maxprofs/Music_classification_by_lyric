                        The whole world feels a little bit more love
 When Christmas comes, when Christmas comes
 And everywhere that you go, there's people singing "Let It Snow"
 And hanging up that mistletoe And me, and you gonna have ourselves a holiday
 And we don't need nobody else to celebrate
 And we're gon' kiss our worries and our cares away
 I can't wait Because this Christmas time get together
 It's gonna be so nice, better than ever
 And baby, you're the one special treasure
 I can't wait to unwrap your love until Christmas comes
 Oh baby So many souls hurt, so many don't have enough
 When Christmas comes, when Christmas comes
 But baby, if you spread love, someday it might be enough
 To heal each other one by one And we gon' get together, and rejoice and pray
 And we gon' help the world become a better place
 And we gon' sing and shout because the savior reigns
 So don't dismay Because this Christmas time get together
 It's gonna be so nice, better than ever
 Because this gift of love lasts forever
 The Lord makes our hearts open up soon as Christmas comes
 It's gon' be alright when Christmas comes Oh, jingle all the way, oh what fun, mmm And we gon' reminisce about the good old days
 And we gon' laugh together as the children play
 And through the years is always gonna be this way
 Come what may Because this Christmas time get together
 It's gonna be so nice, better than ever
 And baby, you're the one that I treasure
 I can't wait to unwrap your love when Christmas comes
