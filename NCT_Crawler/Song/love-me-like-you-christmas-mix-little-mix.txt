                        Bài hát: Love Me Like You (Christmas Mix) - Little Mix

[Intro: All]
Sha-la-la-la
Sha-la-la-la
Sha-la-la-la

[Verse 1: Jade]
You might got the biggest car
Don't mean he can drive me wild or he can go for miles
Said he got a lot of cash
Darling he can't buy my love, it's you I'm dreaming of

[Pre-Chorus: Leigh-Anne & All]
They try to romance me
But you got that nasty
And that's what I want
That's what I want
So baby, baby
Come and save me
Don't need those other numbers
When I got my number one

[Chorus: All]
Last night I lay in bed so blue
Cause I realised the truth, they can't love me like you
I tried to find somebody new
Baby they ain't got a clue, can't love me like you

[Verse 2: Jesy]
You still get it that I want
You were pouring out your love, I could never get enough
Now I'm dealing with these boys
When I really need a man who can do it like I can

[Pre-Chorus: Perrie & All]
They try to romance me
But you got that nasty
And that's what I want
That's what I want
So baby, baby
Come and save me
Don't need those other lovers
When I got my number one

[Chorus]
Last night I lay in bed so blue
Cause I realised the truth, they can't love me like you
I tried to find somebody new
Baby they ain't got a clue, can't love me like you
Sha-la-la-la, woo, sha-la-la-la, oh
Sha-la-la-la, oh, can't love me like you
Sha-la-la-la, woo, sha-la-la-la, oh
Sha-la-la-la, oh, can't love me like you

[Bridge: All]
L-O-V-E, love the way you give it to me
When you're with me, boy I want it everyday
L-O-V-E, love the way you give it to me
When you're with me, boy I want it everyday

[Chorus: All]
Last night I lay in bed so blue
Cause I realised the truth, they can't love me like you
I tried to find somebody new
Baby they ain't got a clue, can't love me like you
Last night I lay in bed so blue
Cause I realised the truth, they can't love me like you
I tried to find somebody new
Baby they ain't got a clue, can't love me like you
                        
                    |
