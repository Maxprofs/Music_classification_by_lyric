                        Bài hát: Dream (Tình Đã Vội Đi, Tình Là Giấc Mơ) - V.A

I can't believe it's just a dream 
I can't believe it's only dream 

I can't believe it's just a dream 
Where do i go since you are not believe me 
what can i do, to have you here 
holding you near, holding you near 

I can't believe it's just a dream 
No matter how i try to believe it 
My heart will tell, you are best for me 
holding me near , loving me near 

I can't believe it's just a dream 
I can't believe it's just a dream 
I can't believe it's only dream
