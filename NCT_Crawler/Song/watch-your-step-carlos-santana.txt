                        You better take it easy baby
 Before you go away
 You did me dirty
 Youll get yours one day

 Chorus:
 You better
 Watch your step...
 Talkin about you
 Watch your step...
 You better
 Watch your step...

 Keep your eyes open wide
 cause youll be hurtin down inside

 You better leave me all your money
 Before you go away
 Dont think Im funny honey
 All Ive got to say

 Chorus

 cause when you took your love
 From me
 You left me full of misery
 Im gonna be all right

 Chorus

 When you need me by your side
 Im gonna say go somewhere and hide
 Watch your step...
 You better watch out baby
 Everything you do
 Im gonna keep my eyes focused,
 Right on you
 You better walk right baby
 Theres just one thing I know
 You better watch your step...
 When you need me by your side
 Im gonna say go somewhere and hide
                        
                    |
