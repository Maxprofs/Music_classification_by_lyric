                        Bài hát: 13 Beaches - Lana Del Rey

[Intro]
I don't belong in the world, that's what it is
Something separates me from other people
Everywhere I turn, there's something blocking my escape

[Verse 1]
It took thirteen beaches to find one empty
But finally, it's mine
With dripping peaches, I'm camera ready
Almost all the time

[Pre-Chorus 1]
But I still get lonely
And baby, only then do I let myself recline
Can I let go, and let your memory dance
In the ballroom of my mind
Across the county line

[Chorus]
It hurts to love you, but I still love you
It's just the way I feel
And I'd be lying if I kept hiding
The fact that I can't deal
And that I've been dying (yeah)
For something real
That I've been dying for something real

[Verse 2]
It took thirteen beaches to find one empty
But finally, I'm fine
Past Ventura and lenses plenty
In the white sunshine

[Pre-Chorus 2]
But you still can find me if you ask nicely
Underneath the pines with the daisies
Feeling hazy in the ballroom of my mind
Across that county line

[Chorus]
It hurts to love you, but I still love you
It's just the way I feel
And I'd be lying if I kept hiding
The fact that I can't deal
And that I've been dying (yeah)
For something real
That I've been dying for something real
It hurts to love you, but I still love you
It's just the way I feel
And I'd be lying if I kept hiding
The fact that I can't deal
The fact that I can't deal
                        
                    |
