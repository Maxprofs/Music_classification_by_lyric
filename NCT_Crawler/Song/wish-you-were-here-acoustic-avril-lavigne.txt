                        I can be tough
I can be strong
But with you, it's not at all
There's a girl
that give a *
Behind this wall
you just walked thought it

(chorus:)
And I remember, all those crazy things you say
You left them running through my head
You're always there, you're everywhere
But right now I wish u were here

All those crazy things we did
Didn't think about it, just went with it
You're always there, you're everywhere
But right now I wish u were here

Damn!
Damn!!
Damn!!!
What I 'd do to have you here, here, here
(I wish you were here)

Damn! Damn!!! Damn!!!!
What I'd do to have you near, near, near
( I wish you were here)


I love the way you are
It's who I am, Don't have to try hard
We always say, say like it is
And the truth is that I really miss

(repeat chorus)
All those crazy things you said 
You left them running through my head 
You're always there, you're everywhere 
But right now I wish you were here. 
All those crazy things we did 
Didn't think about it, just went with it 
You're always there, you're everywhere 
But right now I wish you were here 

Damn, Damn, Damn, 
What I'd do to have you here, here, here 
I wish you were here.
Damn, Damn, Damn 
What I'd do to have you near, near, near 
I wish you were here. 

No, I don't wanna let go 
I just wanna let you to know 
That I never wanna let go 
(let go let go let go let go) 

No, I don't wanna let go 
I just wanna let you to know 
That I never wanna let go 
(let go let go let go let go let go let go let go) 

Damn, Damn, Damn, 
What I'd do to have you here, here, here 
I wish you were here (I wish you were) 
Damn, Damn, Damn 
What I'd do to have you near, near, near 
I wish you were here. 

Damn, Damn, Damn, 
What I'd do to have you here, here, here 
I wish you were here. 
Damn, Damn, Damn 
What I'd do to have you near, near, near 
I wish you were here
