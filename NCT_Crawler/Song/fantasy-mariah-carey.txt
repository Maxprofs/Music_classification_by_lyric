[al:Daydream]
Oh, when you walk by every night
Talking sweet and looking fine
I get kind of hectic inside
Baby I'm so into you
Darling if you only knew
All the things that flow through my mind
I'm in heaven
With my boy friend
My laughing boyfriend
There's no beginning
And there is no end
Feels like I'm dreaming
But I'm not sleeping
(But it's just) sweet fantasy, baby
Sweet, sweet fantasy, baby
Sweet, sweet fantasy, baby
Images of rapture
Creep into me slowly
]As you're going to my head
And my heart beats faster
When you take me over
Time and time and time again
I'm in heaven
With my boy friend
My laughing boyfriend
 There's no beginning
 And there is no end
 Feels like I'm dreaming
 But I'm not sleeping
Sweet, sweet fantasy, baby
Sweet, sweet fantasy, baby
