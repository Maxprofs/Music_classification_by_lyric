                        Look around, it's deadly night
You've been losing every fight
You're hope is, feeling broken
You're feet are rough, they're s *ed and bruised
But still have strength to take you through,
Into,
The dark

(Chorus)
Just close your eyes
And push right through
I know it's tough right now
This was meant for you
When the clouds are gone
Not a shadow in sight
You'll be drenched in the sun
With open eyes

(X4)[Woah-oh-oh]

At the beach, the waves will crash
Tuck and grab and pull you back
The sun may, be covered in gray
The sand will itch, the sun may burn
Hurricane will take it's turn
Until,
The dawn

(Chorus)

So close your eyes, shut them tight
Let it be, and it will fade away (fade away)
Push on though the strength in you
Let it be, and wish it all way

With open eyes,
Open wide,
It's all good now, watch it fade away,
Day by day

(Chorus)
                        
                    |
