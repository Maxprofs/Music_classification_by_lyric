                        Bài hát: Bad Mood - Miley Cyrus

Oooh, I wake up in a bad mood
Oooh, I wake up in a bad mood

I always wake up in a bad mood
I can never fall asleep
I'm always thinkin' 'bout you
What life would be if we didn't meet
I always wake up in a bad mood
Open my eyes and I'm on my feet
And I wonder what you would do, yeah
If you couldn't rely on me

Oooh, I wake up in a bad mood
Oooh, I wake up in a bad mood
And you know that I got the proof
We're held together just by a string
And while you're hanging around with your crew
I'm a balance in too many things

I always wake up in a bad mood
I'm sick of rushing straight to the sink
You acting like you ain't got the news
I don't even really care what you think
But what I do you know I do with love
I believe in more than you can see
And you know I'm never giving up
I ain't stopping till I know I'm free

Oooh, I wake up in a bad mood
Oooh, I wake up in a bad mood
The glass ceiling's about to break
All together, want to hear you say
"I don't know how much more I can take"

You know it's gone on way too long (don't ya?)
And you know it's wrong (don't ya?)
But I know I'm strong (don't ya?)
I don't give up (don't ya?)
And when it gets rough (rough)
I get tough (tough)
I've had enough

Oooh, I wake up in a bad mood
Oooh, I wake up in a bad mood
And when the light starts getting dim
I'll open windows up and let it in
Sometimes it feels like it's about to end
Before it's all about to begin

Oooh, I wake up in a bad mood
Oooh, I wake up in a bad mood
                        
                    |
