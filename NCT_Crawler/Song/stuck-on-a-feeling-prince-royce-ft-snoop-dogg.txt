Prince Royce
Big Snoop Dogg
She got me stuck on a feeling
She got me stuck on a feeling
Que lo que mami

I like you talking dirty
I like your filthy mind
You like the way I hold you
When we are falling in love (Yo se que si)
In love (Mami yo se que si)
If it’s love
Then I don’t want to come back up

Girl I know you’re a handful
Cause you know what you like
You might be hard to handle
But Imma show you tonight (Pero que rica estas)
Tonight (Que rica estas)
What it’s like when you’re
Stuck on a feeling

Just can’t stop
Once ain’t enough
Better lock this down
Better box it up
Gotta work me out
Make it real
Gotta make it count
Get stuck on a feeling

Ya just can’t stop
Once ain’t enough
Better lock this down
Better box it up
Gotta work me out
Make it real
Gotta make it count
Stuck on a feeling

(Dimelo mami)
Stuck on a feeling

Let’s go hide out in private
Wont you show me your place
A little peace and quiet
Where we can both misbehave
Misbehave, Misbehave
Misbehave, It’s okay
It’s okay
When you’re
Stuck on a feeling

Just can’t stop
Once ain’t enough
Better lock this down
Better box it up
Gotta work me out
Make it real
Gotta make it count
Get stuck on a feeling

Ya just can’t stop
Once ain’t enough
Better lock this down
Better box it up
Gotta work me out
Make it real
Gotta make it count
Stuck on a feeling

(Ven conmigo mami)
Stuck on a feeling

[Snoop Dogg:]
Wheelin and dealin
Appealin I’m realin
Ya still in love with me
Al Green
I’m at it
Romantic
No panic
Organic
Slide right next to me
In ecstasy
Now who could ever make you feel like I felt
You’re layin on your bed
Just playing with yourself
You’re moaning and groaning
You’re squirming and squealing
Guess it’s true I left you

Stuck on a feeling

Just can’t stop
Once ain’t enough
Better lock this down
Better box it up
Gotta work me out
Make it real
Gotta make it count
Get stuck on a feeling

Ya just can’t stop
Once ain’t enough
Better lock this down
Better box it up
Gotta work me out
Make it real
Gotta make it count
Stuck on a feeling

She got me stuck on a feeling [x3]
