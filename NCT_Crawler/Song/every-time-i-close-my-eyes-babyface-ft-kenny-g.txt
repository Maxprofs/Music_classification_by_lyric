                        Bài hát: Every Time I Close My Eyes - Babyface, Kenny G

Girl, it's been a long, long time comin' yes it has
But I, I know that it's been worth the wait yeah
Yeah
It feels like springtime in winter
It feels like Christmas in June
It feels like heaven has opened up it's gates for me and you yeah

And every time I close my eyes
I thank the lord that I've got you, yeah
And you've got me too (You've got me too)
And every time I think of it, I pinch myself 'cause
I don't believe it's true yeah
That someone like you loves me too yeah

Hooh yeah

Hoo huh I think that you're truly somethin', yes you are hoo
And you're, you're every bit of a dream come true yeah
With you baby, it never rains and it's no wonder
The sun always shines when I'm near you 
It's just a blessing that I have found somebody like you

And every time I close my eyes
I thank the lord that I've got you yeah
And you've got me too (You've got me too)
And every time I think of it, I pinch myself 'cause
I don't believe it's true yes 
That someone like you loves me too 

To think of all the nights, I've cried myself to sleep, yes
You really oughtta know how much you mean to me 
It's only right that you be in my life right here with me
Oh baby, baby yeah hoo

Hoo and every time I close my eyes
I thank the lord that I've got you baby yeah
And you've got me too baby 
And every time I think of it, and I pinch myself 'cause 
I don't believe it's true 
That someone like you loves me too yeah ey yeaah hoo

Loves me too
