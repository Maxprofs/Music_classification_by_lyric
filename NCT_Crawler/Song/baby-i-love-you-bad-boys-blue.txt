                        Have I ever told you
How good it feels to hold you
It isn't easy to explain
I know I'm really dying
I think I may start crying
My heart can't wait another day
When you touch me I just had to say:
Baby I love you
Baby I love you
Baby I love you
I can't live without you
I love everything about you
I can't help it if I feel this way
Oh I'm so glad I found you
I want my arms around you

I love to hear you when
you call my name
Tell me baby that you feel this way
Baby I love you
Baby I love you
Baby I love you (come on baby)
Baby I love you
Baby I love you
Baby I love you (come on baby)
I love to hear you when
you call my name
Tell me baby that you feel this way
Baby I love you
Baby I love you
Baby I love you (come on baby)
Baby I love you
Baby I love you
Baby I love you (come on baby)
Baby I love you
