In My Bed
Wish I could say it breaks my heart
like you did in the beginning
Its not that we grew apart
a nightingale no longer singing
Its something i know you cant do
seperate sex with emotion
I sleep alone the sun comes up
your still clinging to that notion
Every thing is slowing down
river of no return
recognise my every sound
there is nothing new to learn
you'll never get my mind right
like 2 ships passing in the night
in the night, in the night
want the same thing where we lay
otherwise mines a different way
a different way from where Im going
oh, its you again listen this isnt a reunion
so sorry if i turn my head
yours is a familliar face
but that dont make your place safe
in my bed my bed my bed
I never thought my memory
of what we had could be intruded
but I couldnt let it be
I needed it as much as you did
Now its not hard to understand
why we just speak at night
The only time I hold your hand
is to get the angle right
Everything is slowing down
river of no return
you recognise my every sound
theres nothing new to learn
you'll never get my mind right
like 2 ships passing in the night
in the night in the night
want the same thing where we lay
otherwise mines a different way
a different way from where im going
oh, its you again listen this isnt a reunion
so sorry if I turn my head
yours is a familliar face
but that dont make your place safe
in my bed, my bed, my ba ba dee dee bed
