                        Raindrops keep falling on my head 

And just like the guy whose feet are too big for his bed 

Nothing seems to fit 

Those raindrops are falling on my head 

They keep falling 

So I just did me some talkin' to the sun 

And I said I didn't like the way he got things done 

Sleepin'on th job 

Those raindrops are falling on my head 

They keep falling, but there's one thing I know 

The blues they send to meet me won't defeat me 

*It won't belong till happiness step up to greet me 

Raindrops keep falling on my head 

But that doesn't mean my eyes will soon be turnin' red 

Cryin's not for me 

'Cause I'm never gonna stop the rain by complainin' 

Because I'm free, nothing's worryin' me
                        
                    |
