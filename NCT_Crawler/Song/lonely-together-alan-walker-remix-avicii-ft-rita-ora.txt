                        Bài hát: Lonely Together (Alan Walker Remix) - Avicii, Rita Ora, Alan Walker

Treating you well, but I'm caught in the middle
I caught the edge of a knife and it hurts just a little
And I know, and I know, and I know, and I know that I can be your friend
Yes, my head or my heart, and I'm caught in the middle
My hands are tired, but not tired enough
You're the high that I can't give up
Oh Lord, here we go

I might hate myself tomorrow, but I’m on my way tonight
At the bottom of a bottle, you're the poison in the wine
And I know I can’t change you and I won’t change
I might hate myself tomorrow, but I’m on my way tonight

Let’s be lonely together
A little less lonely together

Eyes my shirt, and it feels like the first time
Before the rush to my blood hurts too much and we flatline
And I know, and I know, and I know, and I know just how this ends
Now we're all messed up and it feels like the first time
My hands are tired, but not tired enough
You're the high that I can't give up
Oh Lord, here we go

I might hate myself tomorrow, but I’m on my way tonight
At the bottom of a bottle, you're the poison in the wine
And I know I can’t change you and I won’t change
I might hate myself tomorrow, but I’m on my way tonight

Let’s be lonely together
A little less lonely together
Let’s be lonely together
A little less lonely together

My hands are tired, but not tired enough
You're the high that I can't give up
Oh Lord, here we go

I might hate myself tomorrow, but I’m on my way tonight
At the bottom of a bottle, you're the poison in the wine
And I know I can’t change you and I won’t change
I might hate myself tomorrow, but I’m on my way tonight
Let’s be lonely together
A little less lonely together
Let’s be lonely together
A little less lonely together
