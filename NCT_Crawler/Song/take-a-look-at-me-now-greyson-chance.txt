                        Bài hát: Take A Look At Me Now - Greyson Chance

So long to electric fences
Not much left for me to run from now
Guess I'll turn myself around
I'm putting down my defenses
These wings are gonna take me off the ground
It's freedom's sweetest sound
And I'll admit that I was wrong
And it's obvious that I'm
Finally taking my fist down

Would you stop and take a look at me now?
Could you stop and take a look at me now?
When you're standing right in front of me
You're looking at the positive that was negative
Would you stop and take a look at me now?

Don't know what you get tomorrow
Not sure where I want to go tonight
Isn't that what life's about?
So long for the fears and worries
Let's go and you won't be sorry
I'll be the one to get you out
Chase the demons out tonight
You can see how fast they run
When you turn the light switch on

Would you stop and take a look at me now?
Could you stop and take a look at me now?
When you're standing right in front of me
You're looking at the positive that was negative
Would you stop and take a look at me now?

And it gets more beautiful, it gets more beautiful
As the sun turns into rain
And the hurt turns into shame
And it gets more wonderful, it gets more wonderful
Can you get this through your brain
That you cannot lose again?

Would you stop and take a look at me now?
Could you stop and take a look at me now?
When you're standing right in front of me
You're looking at the positive that was negative
Would you stop and take a look at me now?
