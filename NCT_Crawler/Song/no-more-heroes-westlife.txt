No More Heroes
Westlife09where we are

When the waves are crashing down
Pulling you to sorrow
I will sail you back to shore
When there are no more heroes

Over under, near or far
I’ll be right beside you
Standing here with open arms
When there are no more heroes

And through it all
And through it all
When you’re tired and you stumble I will carry you
When starlight falls, my love will guide you home
You’ll never be alone
When there are no more heroes

It was you who showed me how
Brought me back to glory
Through hopelessness and darkest days
It was breath you gave me

And through it all
And through it all
When you’re tired and you stumble I will carry you
When starlight falls, my love will guide you home
You’ll never be alone
When there are no more heroes

And through it all
And through it all
When you’re tired and you stumble I will carry you
When starlight falls, my love will guide you home
You’ll never be alone
You’ll never be alone

And through it all
And through it all
When you’re tired and you stumble I will carry you
When starlight falls, my love will guide you home
You’ll never be alone
When there are no more heroes

When there are no more heroes
