                        I know my eyes already like you
 Baby, you
 I know that love, love is found
 Love is found I got the radio on
 I know it won't be long
 'Cause I can hear you, baby
 I can feel your sound I'm drifting closer now
 And I can feel the sound I know, my eyes already like you
 Baby, you
 I know that love, love is found
 Love is found Oh, when my heart go b-boom b-boom
 B-b-boom, b-b-boom boom
 My heart go b-boom b-boom I know, my eyes already like you
 Baby, you
 I know that love, love is found
 Love is found Oh, when my heart go b-boom b-boom
 B-b-boom, b-b-boom boom
 My heart go b-boom b-boom I know, my eyes already like you
 Baby, you
 I know that love, love is found
 Love is found
