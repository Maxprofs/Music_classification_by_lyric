                        Bài hát: Voltage Dubstep - Skrillex

I could watch you for a lifetime. You're my favorite movie.
A thousand endings. You mean everything to me.
I never know what's coming, forever fascinated.
Hope you don't stop running, to me 'cause I'll always be waiting

You gotta believe in the voltage that lives inside us.
So lets buckle up and break our walls down.
You gotta believe in the voltage that lives inside us.
You gotta believe there is something more.
You gotta believe there is something more
