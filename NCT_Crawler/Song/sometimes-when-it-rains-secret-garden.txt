                        Yea Its 50
 1 shot 1 kill whats the deal, yea whats the deal
 Chorus:
 listen, lil homie when it rains it pours
 hollow tips and talans when it rains it pours
 get caught in lead showers just becuz
 niggas aint playin when it rains it pours
 niggas get setup so when it rains it pours
 end up wet up cuz when it rains it pours
 but usually cuz goes down over money and whores
 but lil homie in my hood when it rains it pours
 Verse 1:
 aint nothing change niggas doin the same ol ***
 them little hollow tips and them same ol clips
 in the projects niggas f**k with the same ol chicks
 and somehow they still think they game so sick
 now I'm fit'n ta rip, niggas know im about my grip
 i dont trip man i barely even feed a bitch
 she say im stingy i say i dont need you bitch
 go ahead leave see if i chase you ***
 tell your mami i catch her in the street ima get her
 she no im on parrol why she call police on a nigga
 she just mad cuz a nigga pocket on swole
 when she ask to borrow something i say hell nooo
 i was tellin the lil homies all about this ***
 so keep your mind on your money and dont trust no bitch
 Kiki hit high notes when those pigs came
 but her ass kinda fat so niggas treat her the same
 this is real
 Chorus:
 lil homie when it rains it pours
 hollow tips and talans when it rains it pours
 get caught in lead showers just becuz
 niggas aint playin when it rains it pours
 niggas get setup cuz when it rains it pours
 end up wet up cuz when it rains it pours
 but usually it goes down over money and whores
 but lil homie in my hood when it rains it pours
 Verse 2:
 there was blood stains on my stoop when Niball got shot
 when homicide outside, nigga im not
 this is the 3rd time dem niggas circled the block
 There's money out now, yea but damn its hot
 they'll love to catch a nigga on a direct sale
 They say "Tell us who caught the body or your going to jail"
 look if u know the drill u stay the f**k outta the dodge
 and say "whats happenin?" to the captin and "whats up?" to the sarge
 f**k being in the cage man that *** for the birds
 Charlie drunk drinking Wild Irish Rose on the curb
 in the number spot full of niggas tryin to bet a few bucks
 hoping they number come out they can have um some luck
 went from the ace to the duce stumbled off mad
 lost his reup money man thats all he had
 magazine from the store so he can look at the cars
 and do pullups at the park on the monkey bars
 mad as f**k
 Chorus:
 lil homie when it rains it pours

 niggas get setup cuz when it rains it pours
 end up wet up cuz when it rains it pours
 but usually it goes down over money and whores
 but lil homie in my hood when it rains it pours
