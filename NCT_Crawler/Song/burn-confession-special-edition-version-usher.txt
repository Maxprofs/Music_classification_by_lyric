                        [Intro:]
 I don't understand, why
 See it' s burning me to hold onto this
 I know this is something I gotta do
 But that don't mean I want to
 What I'm trying to say is that I-love-you I just
 I feel like this, is coming to an end
 And it's better for me to, let it go now than hold on and hurt you
 I gotta let it burn

 [Verse:]
 It's gonna burn for me to say this
 But it's comin from my heart
 It's been a long time comin
 But we done been fell apart
 I really wanna work this out
 But I don't think it's gonna change-e
 I do but you don't
 Think it's best we go our separate ways
 Tell me why I should stay in this relationship
 When I'm hurtin' baby, I ain't happy baby
 'Cause there's so many other things I gotta deal with
 I think that you should let it burn

 [Chorus:]
 When the feeling ain't the same and your body don't want to
 But you know, gotta let it go
 'Cause the party ain't jumpin' like it used to
 Even though this might bruise you
 Let it burn
 Let it burn
 Gotta let it burn

 Deep down you know it's best for yourself but you
 Hate the thought of her being with someone else
 But you know that it's over
 You know that it's through
 Let it burn
 Let it burn
 Gotta Let it burn

 [Verse 2:]
 Sendin' pages I ain't supposed to
 Got somebody here but I want you
 Cause the feelin ain't the same
 Find myself
 Callin'her your name
 Ladies tell me do you understand?
 And all my fellas do you feel my pain?
 It's the way I feel
 I knew I made a mistake
 Now it's too late
 Now she ain't comin back
 What I gotta do now now

 To get my shorty back
 Ooo ooo ooo ooooh
 Man I don't know what I'm gonna do
 Without my boo-ooh
 You've been gone for too long
 It's been fifty eleven days, umpteen hours
 I'm'a be burnin' till you return

 [Chorus:]
 When the feeling ain't the same and your body don't want to but you know
 Gotta let it go 'cause the party ain't jumpin' like it used to
 Even though this might bruise you
 Let it burn (let it burn, you gon learn, you go burn)
 Let it burn (gotta let it burn)
 Gotta let it burn

 Deep down you know it's best for yourself but you
 Hate the thought of her being with someone else
 But you know that it's over
 You know that it's through
 Let it burn
 Let it burn
 Gotta let it burn

 [Bridge:]
 I'm twisted 'cause one side of me is tellin' me that I need to move on
 On the other side I wanna break down and cry (ooooh)
 I'm twisted 'cause one side of me is tellin' me that I need to move on
 On the other side I wanna break down and cry (cry)

 [Breakdown]
 Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh oooh
 Ooh ooh oooh (can ya feel me burnin'?)
 Ooh ooh ooh oooh ooh oooh

 Too many days, so many hours
 I'm still burnin' till you return

 [Chorus:]
 When the feeling ain't the same and your body don't want to,
 But you know gotta let it go 'cause the party ain't jumpin' like it used to
 Even though this might bruise you
 Let it burn
 Let it burn
 Gotta let it burn

 Deep down you know it's best for yourself but you
 Hate the thought of her being with someone else
 But you know that it's over
 We know that it's through
 Let it burn
 Let it burn
 Gotta let it burn
