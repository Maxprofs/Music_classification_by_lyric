                        Now's all we got,
And time can't be bought,
I know it inside my heart
Forever will forever be ours,
Even if we try to forget,
Love will remember

[verse 1]
You said you loved me,
I said I loved you back,
What happened to that?
What happened to that?

All your promises,
And all them plans we had,
What happened to that?
What happened to that?

Boom gone,
Yeah we move on
Even if we try to forget

[chorus]
Love will remember you,
Love will remember me,
I know it inside my heart,
Forever will, forever be ours,
Even if we try to forget,
Love will remember 5x

[verse 2]
The trips we dream of takin',
The tags left on the map,
What happened to that?
What happened to that?

When all you had was nothing,
When all we did was laugh,
What happened? what happened?
What happened to that?

Boom gone,
Yeah we move on
Even if we try to forget

[chorus]
Love will remember 5x

[bridge]
Break down the walls,
Let heaven in,
Somewhere in forever
We'll dance again,
We used to be inseparable,
I used to think that I was irreplaceable,
We lit the whole world up,
Before we blew it up,
I just don't know how we screwed it up
Forever 3x

[chorus]
Love will remember 4x
                        
                    |
