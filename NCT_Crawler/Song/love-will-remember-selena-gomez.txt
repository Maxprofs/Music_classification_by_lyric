                        Song: Love Will Remember - Selena Gomez

Now is all we got and time can't be bought 
I know it inside my heart. 
Forever will, forever be ours 
Even if we try to forget, 
Love will remember. 

You said you loved me. 
I said I loved you back. 
What happened to that? 
What happened to that? 
All your promises, 
And all the plans we had. 
What happened to that? 
What happened to that? 

[CHORUS] 
Boom gone, yeah we move on. 
Even if we try to forget, 
Love will remember you 
And love will remember me. 
I know it inside my heart. 
Forever will, forever be ours 
Even if we try to forget, 
Love will remember. [5X] 

[VERSE} 
The trip we dreamed of taking. 
The tacks left on the map. 
What happened to that? 
What happened to that? 
When all you had was nothing. 
And all we did was laugh. 
What happened, what happened, 
What happened to that? 

[CHORUS] 
Boom gone, yeah we move on. 
Even if we try to forget, 
Love will remember you 
And love will remember me. 
I know it inside my heart. 
Forever will, forever be ours 
Even if we try to forget, 
Love will remember. [9X] 

[BRIDGE] 
Break down the walls. 
Let heaven in. 
Somewhere and forever we'll dance again. 
We used to be inseparable. 
I used to think I was irreplaceable. 
We lit the whole world up. 
Before we blew it up. 
I still don't know just how we screwed it up. 
Forever, forever, forever. 

Love will remember you 
Love will remember me. 
I know it inside my heart. 
Forever will, forever be ours 
Even if we try to forget, 
Love will remember. [9X]
