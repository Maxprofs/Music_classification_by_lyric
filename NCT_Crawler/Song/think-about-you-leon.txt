                        Bài hát: Think About You - Léon

Hey you, are you asleep?
I wonder if you're out, if you are drinking
It's late, I know
But baby I ain't wasted, can't you call me?

Can't get along, can't be alone
Where's your mind at?
Are you on your own?
You're falling out, I'm falling back
Where's your heart at?
Don't you feel alone?

Tell me would you give us one more try
Cause I, I think about, I think about you
Heavy-hearted trouble on my mind
Cause I, I think about, I think about you

Your words, they burn
I read it twice, the way you write is different
You're cold, and it's cruel
Acting like I am someone that you never knew

Can't get along, can't be alone
Where's your mind at?
Are you on your own?
You're falling out, I'm falling back
Where's your heart at?
Don't you feel alone?

Tell me would you give us for one more try
Cause I, I think about, I think about you
Heavy-hearted trouble on my mind
Cause I, I think about, I think about you

I tried but it hurt to lie
Don't you remember?
Cause I remember
I tried but it hurt to lie
Don't you remember?
Cause I remember

Tell me would you give us for one more try
Cause I, I think about, I think about you
Heavy-hearted trouble on my mind
Cause I, I think about, I think about you
Tell me would you give us for one more try
Cause I, I think about, I think about you
Heavy-hearted trouble on my mind
Cause I, I think about, I think about you
Cause I, I think about, I think about you
