Nhạc Nhật|

                        mayonaka no uta ga sakenda "Boku hontou wa ano hi kara zutto..."

The midnight song I cried out went "In reality, ever since that day, I..."

akaku sukitooru yuugure no ato hoshitachi wa sora ni suwari, sorezore no oto wo kanadeteita 
sunao ni nare to iwarenakute mo 
namida wa mou boku no omoi wo tsurete ashimoto de chiisana umi ni natta

After the glowing twilight, the stars took their place in the sky and each played its own tune 
Even if I can't say I've become honest, 
Tears have now merged with my emotions and a small sea has formed at my feet

sora wa ugokanai hi ga nobori oriru dake 
jimen wa ugokanai kimi ga aruku ka arukanai ka dakeda

The sky doesn't move; the sun simply rises and sets 
The ground doesn't move; you only either walk or stand still 

mayonaka no uta ga sakenda "Boku hontou wa hitori ga kirai da daikirai da" 
taisetsu wo shitte shimatta ano hi kara zutto 
shiawase nante chiisana SUPUUN de sukueru kurai de juubun nanda 
wakeaeru hito ga iru ka inai ka dakeda

The midnight song I cried out went "In reality, I don't like being alone... I truly hate it" 
I've come to know what's important ever since that day 
A small spoon is almost enough to scoop up happiness 
Is there someone to share it with or must I keep it to myself?

tsuyogaru tabi ni hibi ga hairu kokoro wa sou maru de GARASU saiku ga miseru hakanai yume 
junsui wo butsukeau no ga kowai kara bokura wa mina 
sure tafuri wo shite futoumei na sekai ni sumitsuita

A new crack appears every time I pretend to be strong, so it appears that my heart must be made of glass, just like an empty dream 
Since we're afraid of messing with purity, each and every one of us has acted 
As though we have settled down in this opaque world

omotai jiyuu wo hikizutte aruiteta 
wakare ga kuru tabi sora ga toozakatte yuku you ni mieta

I've walked dragging a weighty freedom along 
Each time separation would come, it seemed as though the sky would sink back

sayonara no ame ga tsubuyaita "Karita mama no kasa ga arunda koko ni arunda" 
karita mama no yasashisa ga kono mune ni zutto 
boku ni wa mada akiramete inai saikai ga aru yakusoku ga aru 
hoshikuzu wo BEDDO ni shite nemutteiru ano hito ni

Farewell; I muttered in the rain "You can borrow my umbrella... that's what it's here for" 
I'll give you the kindness always found inside my heart 
I still haven't given up on the chance of there being a reunion; that's a promise 
To the person who sleeps with stardust as a bed

kisetsu no nai machi ni shagamikomu otoko no ko 
atama wo nadete kureru hito ga inakatta dake sore dake na no ni

In the town with no seasons crouches a sad young boy 
There's simply no one there to stroke his head, but despite that...

hoshi to mitsumeau samugari na kodomotachi

The children who suffer from the cold gaze up at the stars 

mayonaka no uta ga sakenda "Boku hontou wa hitori ga kirai da daikirai da" 
hitoribocchi de ikite yukete shimau nante koto 
shiawase nante chiisana SUPUUN de sukueru kurai de juubun nanda 
wakeaeru hito ga iru ka inai ka dake 
mayonaka no uta wa sakebu yo "Boku hontou wa boku hontou wa sabishikatta" 
taiyou no mabushisa ni kakikesarete mo 
saa hata wo furou ka kata wo kumou ka tada utaou ka doredemo ii yo 
wakeaeru kimi ga iru ka inai ka dakeda yo

The midnight song I cried out went "In reality, I don't like being alone... I truly hate it" 
I've always lived on by myself in solitude 
A small spoon is almost enough to scoop up happiness 
Is there anyone at all to share it with or must it be kept to myself? 
The midnight song I cry out goes "In reality, I... in reality, I... was very lonely" 
Even if it is erased by the blazing sun 
Come on, you can always either wave a flag, go on each other's shoulders or just sing something 
It's just a matter of whether there's someone to share it with or not
                        
                    |
