[00:-8.50]The Shadow of Your Smile
[00:-5.50]- John Gary
[00:-2.50]
The shadow of your smile
when you are gone
Will color all my dreams
and light the dawn
Look into my eyes
my love ,and see
All the lovly things
you are to me

Our wistful little star
was far too high
A teardrop kissed your lips
and so did I
Now when I remember spring
All the joy that love can bring
I will be remembering
The shadow of your smile

Look into my eyes
my love ,and see
All the lovely things
you are to me

Our wistful little star
was far too high
A teardrop kissed your lips
and so did I
Now when I remember spring
All the joy that love can bring
I will be remembering
The shadow of your smile
The shadow of your smile
