                        We gotta sell these bitches the dream, my nigga
 Niggas like Walt Disney around this bitch You're in the presence of the real
 Can't fathom where I'm at, baby, pop another pill
 In a whole another relm
 If you want to make a movie let me know
 It's a whole another film
 I suggest you get your dress for the Golden Globes
 What you know about Tim
 Top down, the Aventador, 4 AM
 On the sunset strip
 Trying to get high at the sunset, baby don't trip
 Hollywood lights, Miami nights
 I'm on a mother***ing binge
 Just might go and buy a Benz
 Or trade a car for your friends
 Oh yeah, we playing with them M's Ridin' down Collins with my entourage following
 Just left SoHo headed to the Go-Go
 Lap dance for the girls
 Let her put her hands on the curves
 You ain't about that life, you scurred
 Ah, baby, you scurred like skrrt to the crib
 What you know about the kid
 What you know bout me, what you know bout me
 What you know bout me, what you know bout me
 Not a mutha***in thing, not a mutha***in thing
 Not a mutha***in thing, not a mutha***in thing What you know bout me, what you know bout me
 What you know bout me, what you know bout me
 Not a mutha***in thing, not a mutha***in thing
 Not a mutha***in thing, not a mutha***in thing I just got back home, 40 days on vacation
 No one killing the game, *** is all for the taking
 What the *** did I stutter? Am I being mistaken?
 I'm a s-s-s-s-s-s-s-s-star in the makin'
 Who you said was the man? What the *** is a deal
 Really do it the best, I'm DJ Khaled for real
 Got my thumb on the pulse, got impeccable timin'
 If they forgot about my worth, I got a check to remind 'em
 Got some things on the wrist, Cartier with the diamonds
 If this was 10 years ago nigga would've went diamond
 I been singing and rapping I make a killin' in both
 If I had to choose a Jackson man I'm feelin' like Bo
 Fresh down to the socks, team look like the Raiders
 I don't take this *** for granted, I'd like to thank my creator
 I'm coming b-b-b-b-b-b-b-back on you haters
 I'm 'bout to put this bitch on her back and get back to you later
 Man, whats up Ridin' down Collins with my entourage following
 Just left SoHo headed to the Go-Go
 Lap dance for the girls
 Let her put her hands on the curves
 You ain't about that life, you scurred
 Ah, baby, you scurred like skrrt to the crib
 What you know about the kid
 What you know bout me, what you know bout me
 What you know bout me, what you know bout me
 Not a mutha***in thing, not a mutha***in thing
 Not a mutha***in thing, not a mutha***in thing What you know bout me, what you know bout me
 What you know bout me, what you know bout me
 Not a mutha***in thing, not a mutha***in thing
 Not a mutha***in thing, not a mutha***in thing We a, problem
 We a, problem Imagine straight from work to the plane, ain't no baggage claim
 Don't need to change your clothes, girl, or your last name
 Mother***ers want to act like I'm cocky
 If you want to be a star, girl you need a co-star
 Got some bitches we can call up, babe
 Now they want to know who you are and how you got there
 Girl, I can try to care, oh, get you out of here
 You and all this gold on me
 On a plane going home, not as you want
 What you mother***ers know about me? What you know bout me, what you know bout me
 What you know bout me, what you know bout me
 Not a mutha***in thing, not a mutha***in thing
 Not a mutha***in thing, not a mutha***in thing What you know bout me, what you know bout me
 What you know bout me, what you know bout me
 Not a mutha***in thing, not a mutha***in thing
 Not a mutha***in thing, not a mutha***in thing
