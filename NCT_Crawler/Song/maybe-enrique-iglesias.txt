                        Bài hát: Maybe - Enrique Iglesias 

If I had one single wish
Id go back to the moment I kissed
You goodbye no matter how hard I tried
I can't live without you in my life

Maybe you’ll say you still want me
Maybe you’ll say that you don't
Maybe we said it was over
Baby I can't let you go

I walk around to understand
Where we went wrong and I can't pretend
It wasn't me, it wasn't you
But I'm convinced we gave up too soon

Maybe you’ll say you still want me
Maybe you’ll say that you don't
Maybe we said it was over
Baby I can't let you go

Nothing left to lose after losing you
There's nothing I cant take
When I run to you, when I come for you
Don’t tell me I'm too late

Maybe you’ll say you still want me
Maybe you’ll say that you don't
Maybe we said it was over
Baby I can't let you go
                        
                    |
