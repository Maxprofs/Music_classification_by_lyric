                        There's something i've gotta say,
you're always with me even though you're far away,
talking to you on my cell,
just the sound of your voice makes my heart melt,
oh girl,its true

CHOROUS:
I'm all about you,
i'm all about us,
no baby you never have to question my love,
and every night,
there's a new crowd,
but it's always you i'm singing about,
there is only one needs words are goin'out to,
oh girl,
i'm all about you
I'm All About You lyrics on 
http://music.***/song/English/4390-I-m-All-About-You~Aaron-Carter.html

i know you worry sometimes,
(sometimes you worry)
some other girl will make me forget you're mine,
there's not a doubt in this world,
that anyone could take the place of my #1 girl,
its true

REPEAT CHOROUS

When I close my eyes I can see you,
its like you're right here,
and these feelings only gettin' stronger,
YOU'RE WITH ME EVERY WHERE!!

REPEAT CHOROUS

I'm all about you, (7 Times Until It Fades)
