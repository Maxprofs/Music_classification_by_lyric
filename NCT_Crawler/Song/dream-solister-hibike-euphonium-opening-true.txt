                        Bài hát: Dream Solister (Hibike! Euphonium Opening) - TRUE

Kanaetai koto ga afureteru kara 
Tachitomatteru hima nante nai yo ne 
Mune ni himeta akogare wo FULL VOLUME de todokeyou 
Ikou CRESCENDO no mukou he

Because there are so many things I want to fulfill 
I'm stopping, and I'm not free 
Let's send the longing that I hid in my chest with full volume 
Let's go! To the other side of that crescendo

Tsumazuite mo ii hamitashite mo ii 
Kimi no neiro wo bokutachi ha matteiru

Even if you stumble, even if you're forced out, it's alright 
We're waiting for your tone

Hibike! Umareta te no yume tsumekonde 
Ookina sora he ima tabi tatou 
Hirake! Egao wo mikata ni tsukete 
Hanasanai akirametakunai 
Genkaisaemo hanekaesu yuuki de 
DREAM SOLISTER

Sound out! Brimming with dreams of being born 
Let's set out now towards that big sky 
Open up! Put a smiling face on our friends 
Don't let go, I don't want to give up 
Have courage to repel even limits 
Dream Solister!

Bukiyou de sunao janai tokoro mo 
Ganbariya no kimi no kosei dakara 
Sugao no mama de mou ichido 
Omoi wo kanadete miyou 
Yume no takuto ha jiyuu jizai

The clumsy, unhonest parts too 
Are part of your hardworking personality 
So one more time with a natural face 
Let's try to play out our feelings 
The beat of our dreams is free

Hitori ja desenai oto ga aru koto 
Kidzuita kara (mayowazu sing) 
Hajikeyou yo (kagayake swing) 
Sorezore no kokoro kasane aeba 
Ima hajimaru 
Seishun no PRELUDE

You can't produce a sound with just one person 
I realized that, so sing without hesitation 
Let's burst forth! Shine! Swing! 
If each person's heart can stack on top of each other's 
It will begin now: 
The prelude of youth

Todoke! Sekai wo makikomu hodo atsuku 
Owaru koto no nai asu wo egakou 
Hitotsu futatsu to fueteku MELODY 
Oide yo koko made oide 
Tanoshimanakucha mada mada FORTISSIMO 
DREAM SOLISTER

Reach! Passionately, and dragging the world along 
Let's picture a future without an end 
With one, then two, the melody is multiplying 
Come, come here 
You have to have fun, there's much more until we're a fortissimo 
Dream Solister!

Maru de itazura kakimitai na MELODY 
Rikutsu janainda ongaku shiyou

A melody that seems like it's written playfully 
Isn't a reason not to, so let's make music!

Hibike! Umareta te no yume tsumekonde 
Ookina sora he ima tabi tatou 
Hirake! Egao wo mikata ni tsukete 
Hanasanai akirametakunai 
Genkaisaemo hanekaesu yuuki de 
DREAM SOLISTER

Sound out! Brimming with dreams of being born 
Let's set out now towards that big sky 
Open up! Put a smiling face on our friends 
Don't let go, I don't want to give up 
Have courage to repel even limits 
Dream Solister!

Hitotsu futatsu to fueteku 
Oide yo koko made oide 
Tanoshimanakucha mada mada FORTISSIMO 
DREAM SOLISTER

With one, then two, it's multiplying 
Come, come here 
You have to have fun, there's much more until we're a fortissimo 
Dream Solister!

Kimi no koe kakasete hoshii yo 
Owaranai ongaku ha 
Tsudzuite yuku

I want you to let me hear your voice 
The unending music 
Goes on
                        
                    |
