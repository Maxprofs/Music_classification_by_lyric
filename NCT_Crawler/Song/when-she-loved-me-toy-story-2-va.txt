                        Bài hát: When She Loved Me (Toy Story 2) - V.A

When somebody loved me, everything was beautiful
 Every hour we spent together, lives within my heart
 And when she was sad, I was there to dry her tears
 And when she was happy, so was i, when she loved me.

 Through the summer and the fall, we had each other, that was all
 Just she and I together, like it was meant to be
 And when she was lonely, I was there to comfort her
 And I knew that she loved me.

 So the years went by, I stayed the same
 And she began to drift away, I was left alone
 Still I waited for the day, when she’d say "i will always love you."

 Lonely and forgotten, never thought she’d look my way,
 She smiled at me and held me, just like she used to do,
 Like she loved me, when she loved me

 When somebody loved me, everything was beautiful,
 Every hour we spent together, lives within my heart
 When she loved me.
