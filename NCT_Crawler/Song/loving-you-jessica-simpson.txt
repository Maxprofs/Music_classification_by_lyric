                        I keep on
I keep on loving

Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Mmm
(I'm gonna keep on loving you)
Mmm
(I'm gonna keep on)
I'm gonna keep on loving you
(Loving you)
Oh
(I'm gonna keep on)

Don't tell me it's time to go
I think my watch is too slow
Please, I don't wanna know
(I don't wanna know)
Baby, what will it hurt
If I stay until nine
And put your soft hands in mine
Boy I think you should know
I'm not letting you go

Oh my
I don't wanna have to say goodnight
Hold tight
I just wanna stay and hold you tight
So right
Feels so right no matter what we do
I'm just gonna keep on loving you

Yeah you're like heaven to hold
And you're the flame when I'm cold
(Boy I think you should know)
Boy I think you should know
I'm not letting you go

Oh my
I don't wanna have to say goodnight
Hold tight
I just wanna stay and hold you tight
So right
It feels so right no matter what we do
I'm just gonna keep on loving you
Oh my
Love me like the rainbow loves the light
Hold tight
Feels me like the raindrops kiss the sky
So right
Feels so right no matter what we do
I'm just gonna keep on loving you

I think I should stay awhile and keep enjoying you
Come close, wrap me in your arms
Say you want me too
Intoxicated by the way you're making me move
I know I'm gonna keep on loving you

Oh
(la, la, la, la, la, la)
(So right)
(la, la, la, la, la, la)

I'm gonna keep on loving you
