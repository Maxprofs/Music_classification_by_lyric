                        Bài hát: Walking In The Wind - One Direction

A week ago he said to me
Do you believe I'll never be too far
If you're lost, just look for me
You'll find me
Fact that we can sit right here and say goodbye
Means we've already won
For apologies between you and me
Clearly there is none

We had some good times, didn't we?
We wore our hearts out on our sleeve
Goodbyes are bittersweet
But it's not the end
I'll see your face again

You will find me
And you will find me
In places that we've never been
For reasons we don't understand
Walking in the wind
Walking in the wind

Yesterday I went out to celebrate the birthday of a friend
But as we raised our glasses up to make a toast
I realized you were missing

We had some good times, didn't we?
We wore our hearts out on our sleeve
Goodbyes are bittersweet
But it's not the end
I'll see your face again

You will find me
And you will find me
In places that we've never been
For reasons we don't understand
Walking in the wind
Walking in the wind

I know
Just close your eyes and see
I'll be by your side
Any time you leave me

You will find me
And you will find me
In places that we've never been
For reasons we don't understand
Walking in the wind
Walking in the wind
Walking in the wind
