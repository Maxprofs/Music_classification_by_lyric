I can give you anything you want, oh oh
Guarantee you’ll never go to bed alone
I can take you all around the globe
Show you things you've never seen or ever known
I can show you better better (oh oh)
Change your life forever ever
Yeah I can show you better better (oh oh)
Oh let me tell you, tell you

Yeah tonight, tonight I see you dancing all alone
I’m gonna light up your lights you never had this dream before
I'll make you feel that alright
Like a song you got to know
If you wanna feel the life and be my boom sing along.

You wanna go all out dirty bass keep bumping here
If you wanna go all out
