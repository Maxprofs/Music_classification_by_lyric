                        I won't blame the hurting on you
You left in the sweetest way
I won't say that it's you
Making me feel this way

It's the heart and the soul
And the body and the brain driving me insane
But the wind and the land
And the fire and the rain always stay the same

Ai, ai, ai
Wanna roll with the wind
Bringing distance to everything
Ai, ai, ai, whoa

Ai, ai, ai
Wanna sit by the fire
And glance at the pouring rain
Ai, ai, ai, ai, ai, ai

I won't claim it's all 'cause of you
I guess that I played a part
It's just that I never knew
I'd fall for you from the start

There's a hole in my heart
And a picture in a frame driving me insane
But the wind and the land
And the fire and the rain always stay the same

Ai, ai, ai
Wanna roll with the wind
Bringing distance to everything
Ai, ai, ai, whoa

Ai, ai, ai
Wanna sit by the fire
And glance at the pouring rain
Ai, ai, ai, ai, ai, ai

I would never blame you for the heartache
I would never blame you for the tears
I blame my stubborn heart, soul, body
Every single thing around me stays the same no matter what

Ai, ai, ai
Wanna roll with the wind
Bringing distance to everything
Ai, ai, ai, whoa

Ai, ai, ai
Wanna sit by the fire
And glance at the pouring rain
Ai, ai, ai, ai, ai, ai

Ai, ai, ai
Wanna roll with the wind
Bringing distance to everything
Ai, ai, ai, whoa

Ai, ai, ai
Wanna sit by the fire
And glance at the pouring rain
Ai, ai, ai, ai, ai, ai
