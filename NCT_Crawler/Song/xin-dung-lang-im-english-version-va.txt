                        Bài hát: Xin Đừng Lặng Im (English Version) - V.A

Can't forget the moment when I left 
When you're standing there and nothing were said 
You've put all the pains away inside
I'll be gone with my memories for you
How do I go back
Please say something to me
Don't let your silence break my heart 
Though your love has gone I'm begging for your last words 
I'm in a whole wide world 
But you are the world in me, my girl
Now we are apart but I'll wait for you

I have tried so hard to know you more 
But I'd never could though I was with you
Maybe we should not say we're in love 
One looks for a start, the other walks away
With a broken heart
Please say something to me
Don't let your silence break my heart 
Though your love has gone I'm begging for your last words 
I'm in a whole wide world 
But you are the world in me, my girl
Now we are apart but I'll wait for you

I don't have no clues 
What was on your mind after everything
When I walked away
I'd rather share the pain with you than see you suffer it 
I'm so tangled up
Should we separate ways? 
Does it really hurt?
To be letting go
Say it so we don't have to regret
Please say something to me
Don't let your silence break my heart 
Though your love has gone I'm begging for your last words 
I'm in a whole wide world 
But you are the world in me, my girl
Now we are apart but I'll wait for you
Now we are apart but I'll wait for you
                        
                    |
