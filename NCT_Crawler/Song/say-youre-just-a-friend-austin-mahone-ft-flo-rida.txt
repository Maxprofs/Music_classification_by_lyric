                        Bài hát: Say You'Re Just A Friend - Austin Mahone, Flo Rida

Hey hey baby you've been on my mind I knew you for a long time
but I've been thinking baby that you should know (oh oh yeah eh uh) 
Hey hey baby can we compromise I really want you to be mine 
I've got a million places that we could go (o, oh yeah uh) 

I wanna be your everything, I want to be the one you need 
So tell me where ya been all my life, gonna make you mine tonight 

Hey baby you, you got what I need 
But you say you're just a friend 
yeah you say you're just a friend 
[x2] 

Hey hey baby we've been on the phone 
spending time together alone, 
but every time we talk the words don't come out right 
oh oh, yeah e uh 

Hey hey baby when I look in your eyes 
I can tell that you're holding something inside 
I've been thinking bout you you you 
I've been thinking bout me me me 

I wanna be your everything, I want to be the one you need 
So tell me where ya been all my life, gonna make you mine tonight 

Hey baby you, you got what I need 
But you say you're just a friend 
yeah you say you're just a friend 
[x2] 

[Flo Rida:] 
Yeah, kinda been seeing this most of my nights, tryna make other girls whistle 
but its a hell of a life how to make the wrong hit 
no bring it back right round let the good times roll feeling good right now 
but I remember this marking 1989 maybe 90, can't do me like 
a song I wrote, cutting glass chasing you 'cause you all I want 
like you, you got what I need, as if not I'll just pretend but still, 
I can get your friend I'm playing, no 
but maybe that's a little too much tripping, we brushing eyes I can see the twinkle in them 
thought we'd be together til I see the wrinkle in them- 
but I guess not 

Hey baby you, you got what I need 
But you say you're just a friend 
yeah you say you're just a friend
