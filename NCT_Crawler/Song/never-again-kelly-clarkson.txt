                        Title: Never Again
Artist: Kelly Clarkson
Albums: Greatest Hits: Chapter One - Kelly Clarkson

I hope the ring you gave to her
turns her finger green

I hope when you re in bed with her
You think of me

I would never wish bad things
But I don t wish you well

Could you tell by the flames
that burned your words

I never read your letter
Cause I knew what you d say
Give me that Sunday school answer
Try and make it all ok

Does it hurt
To know I ll never be there
Bet it sucks
See my face everywhere
It was you
Who chose to end it like you did
I was the last to know
You knew
Exactly what you would do
Don t say
You simply lost your way
She may believe you but I never will

Never again

If she really knows the truth
She deserves you

A trophy wife oh~ how cute

Ignorance is bliss
But when your day comes
and he s through with you

And he ll be through with you

You ll die together but alone

You wrote me in a letter
You couldn t say it right to my face

Give me that Sunday school answer
Repent yourself away

Does it hurt
To know I ll never be there
Bet it sucks

See my face everywhere
It was you
Who chose to end it like you did

I was the last to know
You knew
Exactly what you would do
Don t say
You simply lost your way
They may believe you but I never will

Never again

Never again will I hear you
Never again will I miss you
Never again will I fall to you
Never

Never again will I kiss you
Never again will I want to
Never again will I love you
Never

Does it hurt
To know I ll never be there
Bet it sucks
See my face everywhere
It was you
Who chose to end it like you did
I was the last to know
You knew
Exactly what you would do
Don t say
You simply lost your way
They may believe you but I never will

I never will
I never will
Never again
