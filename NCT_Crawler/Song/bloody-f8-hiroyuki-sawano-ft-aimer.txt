                        Bài hát: Bloody F8 - Hiroyuki Sawano, Aimer

Behind your mask
You smile, smile me with the greed
And the frantic eyes
I hate it, but I can't deny it
I don't wanna be like you
The feud between us escalates deeper
Into tons of tragic wages
Can't stand it, but I never fight it
Though I haven't proofed enough

Hypnotized by your charismata
None realized, you won't be true
But I know you are right if I were on your side
So confused

God, what a judgement!
Is my punishment?
Can't I escape from my sole bloody fate?
Where is my fragment?
Lost is the moment
Need to look back what we'd done with
They are still crying
Who can hold back this war of slaughter?
Ain't no one gotta refuse
It doesn't really matter

Betray myself to save the others' soul
Although I wanna get out of here

We will keep running
We will keep running
We will keep running
To the One-way Freedom
We will keep rolling

We will keep rolling
We will keep rolling
To the One-way Freedom

Behind your back
So dark, something dark has ruled
Your words and deeds
I found it, but I couldn't prove it
I don't wanna feel for you
We clearly missed out

Furthermore we'll repeat the same guilt
With the sick creeds
Can't avoid it, but i'll try to fix it
And we've gotta turn the tide

Hypnotized by your charismata
None realized, you won't be true
But I know you are right if I were on your side
So confused...

God, what a judgement!
Is my punishment?
Can't I escape from my sole bloody fate?
Where is my fragment?
Lost is the moment
Need to look back what we'd done with

They are still crying
Who can hold back this war of slaughter?
Ain't no one gotta refuse
It doesn't really matter
Betray myself to save the others' soul
Although I wanna get out of here

No more pain remained to regret with the stains
Wash all them off to forget
My damn conflicts with you
Don't let me be off my nuts
Cuz of your surrender
Why don't you sell me out?
Why don't you take it out?

Almost I lose what I'm living for
Knock on the floor to spit out
The anger from hatred
Don't let me be off my nuts
Cuz of your surrender
Why don't you sell me out?
Why don't you beat me?

We will keep running
We will keep running
We will keep running
To the One-way Freedom
We will keep rolling
We will keep rolling
We will keep rolling
To the One-way Freedom
