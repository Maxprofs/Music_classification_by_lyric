                        Bài hát: For you entertainment - Adam Lambert

So hot out the box can we pick up the pace?
Turn it up, heat it up I need to be entertained
Push the limit, are you with it?
Baby, don’t be afraid
I’m a hurt ‘ya real good, baby

Let’s go it’s my show
Baby, do what I say
Don’t trip off the glitz
That I’m gonna display
I told ya I’ma hold ya
Down until you’re amazed
Give it to you ’til your screaming my name

No escaping when I start
Once I’m in I own your heart
There’s no way you’ll ring the alarm
So hold on until it’s over

Chorus
Oooh, do you know what you got into?
Can you handle what I’m about to do?
‘Cause it’s about to get rough for you
I’m here for your entertainment
Oooh, I bet you thought that I was soft and sweet
‘Ya fallen angel swept ya off ya feet
Well I’m about to turn up the heat
I’m here for your entertainment

It’s alright you’ll be fine baby, I’m in control
Take the pain take the pleasure
I’m the master of both
Close your eyes not your mind
Let me into your soul
I’ma work ya ’til your totally blown

No escaping when I start
Once I’m in I own your heart
There’s no way you ring the alarm
So hold on until it’s over

Chorus
Oooh, do you know what you got into?
Can you handle what I’m ’bout to do?
Cause it’s about to get rough for you
I’m here for your entertainment
Oh, I bet you thought that I was soft and sweet
You fallen angel swept ya off your feet
Well I’m about to turn up the heat
I’m here for your entertainment

Entertainment...
I’m here for your entertainment...
Do you like what you see?
Let me entertain ya ’till you scream

Chorus
oooh, do you know what you got into?
Can you handle what I’m ’bout to do?
‘Cause it’s about to get rough for you
I’m here for your entertainment
Oooh, I bet you thought that I was soft and sweet
You fallen angel swept ya off your feet
Well I’m about to turn up the heat
I’m here for your entertainment
