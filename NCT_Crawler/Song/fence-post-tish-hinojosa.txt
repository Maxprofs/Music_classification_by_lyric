                        Bài hát: Fence Post - Tish Hinojosa

I’m feeling like a fence post,
Looking at a rail yard.
Everything’s grey,
My heart’s pinned away,
My feet are nailed to the ground.
I’m wired standing up,
I’m broken and cut,
But I can’t seem to just fall down.
And something about the sound out here just kills me.

Once upon a fast train,
Time was like a wild dream.
Speed on the track,
The wind on my back,
On wings I was heaven bound.
Now I’m wired standing up,
I’m broken and cut,
But I can’t seem to just fall down.
And something about the sound out here just kills me.

I’m feeling so forgotten,
Dirty, used and common.
An old piece of wood,
But doing some good.
A borderline firm and stuck,
Cuz’ I’m wired standing up,
I’m broken and cut,
But I can’t seem to just fall down.
And something about the sound out here just kills me.
