                        Mama, how do I begin
 To explain this situation we're in?
 Angels heard the beautiful words that you prayed
 And showed me the way to you And they knew you were in love
 So they sent me down from heaven above
 Angels cried and kissed me goodbye, I was long gone
 This is my song to you Oh, my song could never be
 As sweet as the song you sing to me
 Oh, my love could never be
 As deep as the love you give to me When your fingers touch my skin
 And you kiss my lips and tickle my chin
 I breathe you in, oh Mama, I'm where I belong
 This is my song to you Oh, my song could never be
 As sweet as the song you sing to me
 Oh, my love could never be
 As deep as the love you give to me Oh, one day I will be grown
 And I know, I'll have a child on my own
 Remember me this way, 'cause some day
 I'll be long gone, singing my song to you Oh, my song could never be
 As sweet as the song you sing to me
 Oh, my love could never be
 As deep as the love you give to me
                        
                    |
