Engtrans 
When they see me, they go
Ah so pretty, ah ah, ah so pretty, ah so pretty, ah so pretty
When they see me, they go
Ah so pretty, ah ah, ah so pretty
Even when I see me, I go
Ah so pretty, ah ah, ah so pretty, ah so pretty, ah so pretty
When they see me, they go
Ah so pretty, ah ah, ah so pretty
Even when I see me, I go

Even when I see me, I can see the superior genes
that’s right got my space jams on super fly
Everyone asks me
Who’s your mama? Who who?
They hashtag Jessi sexy
In a taxi that only takes boy toys
The winner is already named in this competition
Even men get scared, Ronda Rousey

WHO THAT WHO THAT They call me fierce unni
TRUE THAT TRUE THAT a seriously fierce unni
Dying, dying, everyone’s backing down
SEE THAT SEE THAT

Whatever I wear
Even if I swear
No matter what people say about me
Then still look at me like
Ah so pretty, ah ah, ah so pretty, ah so pretty, ah so pretty
When they see me, they go
Ah so pretty, ah ah, ah so pretty
Even when I see me, I go

My friends call me Sica
You think you Flowsik but my flow more sicker
My personality is like Pisa, slightly crooked
Tell me who the baddest senorita
It’s obvious, isn’t it?
It’s just gonna hurt my mouth to say it
Don’t criticize me, just mind your own business
Cause either way
I get it popping and I’m living okay

WHO THAT WHO THAT They call me fierce unni
TRUE THAT TRUE THAT a seriously fierce unni
Dying, dying, everyone’s backing down
SEE THAT SEE THAT

Whatever I wear
Even if I swear
No matter what people say about me
Then still look at me like
Ah so pretty, ah ah, ah so pretty, ah so pretty, ah so pretty
When they see me, they go
Ah so pretty, ah ah, ah so pretty
Even when I see me, I go

Who are you to judge me?
This is my moment, whatever I do I succeed
Who are you to judge me?
This is my stage, whatever I do I succeed

Whatever I wear
Even if I swear
No matter what people say about me
Then still look at me like
Ah so pretty, ah ah, ah so pretty, ah so pretty, ah so pretty
When they see me, they go
Ah so pretty, ah ah, ah so pretty
Even when I see me, I go
                        
                    |
