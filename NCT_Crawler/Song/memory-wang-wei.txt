                        Bài hát: Memory - Wang Wei

Midnight
Not a sound from the pavement
Has the moon lost her memory?
She is smiling alone In the lamp-light
The withered leaves collect at my feet
And the wind begins to moan
Memory
All alone in the moonlight
I can smile of the old days
I was beautiful then I remember
The time I knew what happiness was
Let the memory live again
Every street lamp
Seems to beat a fatalistic warning
Someone mutters and the street lamp sputters
And soon it will be morning
Daylight
I must wait for the sunrise
I must think of a new life
And I mustn't give in
When the dawn comes
Tonight will be a memory too
And a new day will begin
Burnt out ends of smoky days
The stale cold smell of morning
A street lamp dies, another night is over
Another day is dawning
Touch me
It's so easy to leave me
All alone with my memory
Of my days in the sun
If you touch me
You'll understand what happiness is
Look, a new day has begun
                        
                    |
