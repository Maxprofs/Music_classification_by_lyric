                        Song: Teenage Daughters - Martina McBride
I ain't complainin'
 But I'm tired, so I'm just sayin'
 What I think
 And if we're being honest
 Then honestly I think I need a drink My baby's growin' up
 She thinks she's fallin' all in love
 And that I hate her
 At seventeen, she's just like me when I was seventeen
 So I don't blame her Do do do do
 Do do do do
 What are we gonna do?
 Do do do do
 Do do do do
 What are we gonna do about it? Remember when we use to be
 Everything they ever need
 We had them believing we were cool
 It's like it happened over night
 We're always wrong, they're always right
 We use to be the one's breakin' the rules
 Now we're just mothers, we're just fathers of
 Teenage daughters She rolls her eye's when I'm funny
 But she's sweet when she wants money and her freedom
 Oh my god, she's got a car
 Swears they won't go far
 And I wish I believed 'em Do do do do
 Do do do do
 What are we gonna do?
 Do do do do
 Do do do do
 What are we gonna do about it? Remember when we use to be
 Everything they ever need
 We had them believing we were cool
 It's like it happened over night
 We're always wrong, they're always right
 We use to be the one's breakin' the rules
 Now we're just mothers, yeah, we're just fathers of
 Teenage daughters They're beautiful, wild and free
 Everything we wish we could be
 But they're still crazy
 Oh you know, they make us crazy Remember when we use to be
 Everything they ever need
 We had them believing we were cool
 It's like it happened over night
 We're always wrong, they're always right
 We use to be the one's breakin' the rules
 Now we're just mothers, and we're just fathers of
 Teenage daughters Yeah teenage daughters I ain't complainin'
 But I'm just tired, so I'm just sayin'
 What I think
 If we're being honest
 Then honestly, I think I need a drink
