                        [Rihanna]
I've been everywhere, man
Looking for someone
Someone who can please me
Love me all night long
I've been everywhere, man
Looking for you babe
Looking for you babe
Searching for you babe

Where have you been
Cause I never see you out
Are you hiding from me, yeah?
Somewhere in the crowd

[Hook]
Where have you been,
All my life, all my life
Where have you been, all my life
Where have you been, all my life
Where have you been, all my life
Where have you been, all my life


[Nicki Minaj:]
Just met a boy, just met a boy when
He could come inside of my play pen
'cause he look like a superstar in the making
So I think that I'm going in for the taking
Hear through the grape vine that he caking
W-w-we could shoot a movie, he could do the taping
B-b-boom boom pow, this thing be shaking
I ain't even tryna find out who he dating
'cause I know he got a wife at home
But I need just one night alone
If he keep playing them kidding games
Imma run away aye, Imma run away aye aye


[Chorus:]
Ah ah I wanna give you
One last option
Ah ah I wanna give you
One last chance
I-If you're looking for the
Main attraction
Just hold on tight and
Let me do my dance
If you want it I'm gonna be
Va va voom, voom
If you got it, you got it
You got that boom boom
If you want it, I'm gonna be
Va va voom, voom
If you got it, you got it
You got that boom boom

I've been everywhere, man
Looking for someone
Someone who can please me

I've been everywhere, man
Looking for you babe
Looking for you babe

Where have you been,
All my life, all my life
Where have you been, all my life
Where have you been, all my life
Where have you been, all my life
Where have you been, all my life
