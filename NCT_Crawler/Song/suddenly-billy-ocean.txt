Song: Suddenly
Artist: Billy Ocean
Album:Feelings (18 Memorable Hits)

I use to think that love was just a fairy tale
Until that first hello
Until that first smile
But if i had to do it all again
I wouldn't change a thing
Cuz this love is everlasting
...
Suddenly (suddenly, suddenly)
Life has new meaning to me
There's beauty up above
and things we never take notice of
You wake up and suddenly you're in love (oooh)
...
Girl you're everything a man could want and more
A thousand words are not enough to say what i feel inside
Holding hands as we walk along the shore
Never felt like this before (never felt like this before)
Now you're all i'm living for
...
Suddenly
Life has new meaning to me
There's beauty up above
and things we never take notice of
You wake up and suddenly you're in love
...
Each day (each day baby)
I pray
This of love we feel will last forever
...
Suddenly
Life has new meaning to me
There's beauty up above
and things we never take notice of
You wake up and suddenly you're in love (ooohhhh)
There's beauty up above
and things we never take notice of
You wake up and suddenly you're in love (ooohhhh)
