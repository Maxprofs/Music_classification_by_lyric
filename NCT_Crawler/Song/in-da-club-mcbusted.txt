                        Why am I
 Why am I
 Why am I
 Standing in the club
 Why am I
 Why am I
 Why am I
 Standing in the club I'm standing in the club
 I'm standing in the club
 Spending all my cash
 Trying to chat these bitches up
 I'm standing in the club
 I'm standing in the club
 But the DJ sucks
 So why am I in the club
 This room is so hot
 The girls are so not
 And I can't find my friends
 It's the hot spot
 Tonight, but so what
 I still can't find my friends (can't find my friends)
 I think I'm about
 To puke and pass out
 I wish that this night would end Why am I
 Why am I
 Why am I
 Standing in the club
 Why am I
 Why am I
 Why am I
 Standing in the club I'm standing in the club
 I'm standing in the club
 And the Black Eyed Peas and P Diddy say what up
 I'm standing in the club
 I'm standing in the club
 And I'm on my knees in the bathroom throwing up
 My girl is at home
 I'm here on my own
 I'm not looking for romance
 But, down on the floor
 Some chick is hardcore
 She's tryin' to get in my pants (get in my pants)
 Now this is not right
 She might change her mind
 The more that she sees me dance Why am I
 Why am I
 Why am I
 Standing in the club
 Why am I
 Why am I
 Why am I
 Standing in the club DJ, play something good
 DJ, I wish that you would
 DJ, play something good
 DJ, I wish that you would
 DJ, play something good
 DJ, I wish that you would
 DJ, play something good
 DJ, DJ Why am I
 Why am I
 Why am I
 Standing in the club
 Why am I
 Why am I
 Why am I
 Standing in the club
