                        Bài hát: Soundwave (Extended Mix) - R3hab, Trevor Guthrie

Come around, come around make a wall of thunder
Be a spark in the dark, that tidal wave that’s ignite
Build it up now, waiting for the drop is the wonder[?]
Oh, what a sound, weighing down on a beautiful sun

I need a soundwave, no slowing down, sing woah, woah
Into the sunrays, no cooling down, sing woah, woah
Let’s just keep going on (oooo oooo ooo ooo oo oo)
Let’s just keep goin’

No comin’ down, comin’ down, keep the innovations
Say hello to the crowd, our firebirds into the night
Turn it up now, sending only good vibrations
A whole wall of sound crushing down all around
What a beautiful life

I need a soundwave, no slowing down, sing woah, woah
Into the sunrays, no cooling down, sing woah, woah
Let’s just keep going on (oooo oooo ooo ooo oo oo)
Let’s just keep goin’
