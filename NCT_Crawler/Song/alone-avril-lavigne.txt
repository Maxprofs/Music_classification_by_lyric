Artist: Avril Lavigne
Hey man
Tell me what were you thinking
What the hell were you saying?
Oh come on now
Stop! and think about it
Hey now
maybe you should just listen
maybe you should stop talking for a second
Shut up! listen to me

Hey bro
I'm just tryin' to let you know
you really think that you're special
oh come on now
I've seen so much better
hey there
did you actually think that I cared?
Don't know if you want to go there
oh come on now
keep on keep on dreaming

You're so obvious
you're so oblivious
and now you wonder why
you're the one alone
So don't apologize
you don't even realize
you screwed it up this time
now you're the one alone

If you, want to, be my
uh uh oh
you know, you can't, play games
and you know what I mean
sorry, but you don't, get my
my-y-y-y ~
I'm gone, you're still, dreaming
about me
over and over and over and over and over again

You're so obvious
you're so oblivious
and now you wonder why
you're the one alone
So don't apologize
you don't even realize
you screwed it up this time
now you're the one alone
Uh uh oh oh oh
Uh uh oh oh oh
Alone
