                        Bài hát: Far Too Young To Die - Panic! at the Disco

[Verse 1:]
I never so adored you
I'm twisting allegories now
I want to complicate you
Don't let me do this to myself

I'm chasing roller coasters
Ive got to have you closer now
Endless romantic stories
You never could control me

[Chorus:]
Well I never really thought that you'd come tonight
When the crown hangs heavy on either side
Give me one last kiss while we're far too young to die.

[Verse 2:]
Fixation or psychosis?
Devoted to neurosis now
Endless romantic stories
You never could control me

[Chorus:]
Well I never really thought that you'd come tonight
When the crown hangs heavy on either side
Give me one last kiss while we're far too young to die.
                        
                    |
