[00:-1.00]Paramore - Where The Lines Overlap

Give me attention
I need it now
Too mauch distance
To measure it out, out loud

Tracing patterns
Across a personal map
And making pictures
Where the lines overlap
Where the lines overlap

No one is as lucky as us
We're not at the end, but
Oh, we already won
No, no, no one is as lucky as us
Is as lucky as us

Call me over
And tell me how
Well, you got so far
And never making a single sound

I'm not used to it
But I can learn
There's nothing to it
I've never been happier
I've never been happier

No one is as lucky as us
We're not at the end, but
Oh, we already won
Oh, no, no one is as lucky as us
Is as lucky as us

Now I've got a feeling
If I sang this loud enough
You would sing it back to me
I've got a feeling
If I sang this loud enough
You would sing it back to me
I've got a feeling
(I've got a feeling)
That you would sing it back to me
That you would sing it back to me

No one is as lucky as us
We're not at the end, but
Oh, we already won
Oh, no, no one is as lucky as us
Is as lucky as us
Is as lucky as us
