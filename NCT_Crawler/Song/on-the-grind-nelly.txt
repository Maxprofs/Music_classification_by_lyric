 Swing
 Nel
 My duo with Jacob
 Yeah, come on Now if you're going to ride, get inside, let's roll
 If you're running your mouth, then, ***, then shut my door
 I ain't got nothing on my hands but time, tell me
 Were you the one that's on the grind
 If you're going to ride get inside, let's roll
 If you're running your mouth then, ***, then shut my door
 I ain't got nothing on my hands but time, tell me
 Were you the one that's on the grind (check it)
 Was it you that was on the grind tell me They acting like they really want it with me, trust me
 They don't really want it, they just want to be seen
 They wanna disrupt my team with these publicity schemes
 Trying to dismantle my panel with lies, rumours and scandals
 But uh, I pull through it like I'm tugging a war
 I tell you the situation like I've been here before
 I'm still popping dirty, still smoking, point clicking
 Watching the doors open, no joking, everything's remoting
 No choking or bleeding, this ride is for free
 No matter what you got your dying for free
 Automatically i'm focused like thirty five millimetres
 All of the sudden like such and such wants to meet us
 All of the sudden like such and such wants to greet us
 The same, will you believe us
 Now, they're all trying to cheat us
 In real life, they can't beat us
 Sometimes, they try to repeat us Now if you're going to ride, get inside, let's roll
 If you're running your mouth, then, ***, then shut my door
 I ain't got nothing on my hands but time, tell me

 Why is they stunting like they holding the keys, tell me
 Them type of people don't be holding no heat, no
 Then how the *** they gon' be rolling with me, yeah
 Dude, how the hell you ain't going to waste your time, wait your time
 Your mouth's going to *** around and going to waste your time, hey
 I told them niggas' that ain't going to grind
 When its peso time, come out and take your shine dirty
 I'm the same nigga that's out of control, that's out of control
 I put a little malinger out on the roll, hey
 The bigger it just got the calico
 I been cocking and loading, I been popping them fours, yeah
 Set that aside 'cause I've got to get those, got to get those
 The finest *** than what you're proud of me for, tell me

 Smoke sticky now and the misses' pick me now (you tell 'em)
 Watch me now, I'm spiffy now
 Smoke sticky now and the misses' pick me now Well, if I said it, I've done it, if I've done it, I did it
 And if I, and if I want it, if I don't put it against it
 The way that I should spend it to get just how I should
 All money ain't good money but no money ain't good
 I took the hood tactics and plot with musical talents
 Trying to create a balance in between Minnesota and Dallas
 Never matters when I'm speaking, if you're peeping, just let me know
 I'm guaranteed to keep it cracking, just like eggs hitting the floor, uh
 I'm dotting, just wanna be, I ask, oh
 Clipping the wings I want to fly ass oh
 Only Q and D Miles can look down on me
 Maybe, I should bee bee in my head, I put it down, homie Now if you're going to ride, get inside, let's roll
 If you're running your mouth, then, ***, then shut my door
 I ain't got nothing on my hands but time, tell me
 Were you the one that's on the grind
