                        Bài hát: Angel (Remix) - Westlife

Spend all your time waiting
For that second chance
For a break that would make it okay
There's always some reason
To feel not good enough
And it's hard at the end of the day

I need some distraction
Oh beautiful release
Memory seeps from my veins
Let me be empty
Oh weightless and maybe
I'll find some peace tonight

In the arms of the Angel
Fly away from here
From this dark cold hotel room
And the endlessness that you fear
You are pulled from the wreckage
Of your silent reverie
You're in the arms of the Angel
May you find some comfort here

So tired of the straight line
And everywhere you turn
There's vultures and thieves at your back
Storm keeps on twisting
Keep on building the lies
That you make up for all that you lack

It don't make no difference
Escape one last time
It's easier to believe
In this sweet madness, oh
This glorious sadness
That brings me to my knees

In the arms of the Angel
Fly away from here
From this dark cold hotel room
And the endlessness that you fear
You are pulled from the wreckage
Of your silent reverie
You're in the arms of the Angel
May you find some comfort here

You're in the arms of the Angel
May you find some comfort here
Some comfort here
                        
                    |
