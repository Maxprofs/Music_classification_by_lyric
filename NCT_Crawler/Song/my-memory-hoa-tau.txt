------ English Translation :

My memory
I remember everything
I can see even a little thing
When I close my eyes
You far away
Some where that I can't reach
You used to be good
I didn't say I love you
or I wait for you

I really didn't imagine
meeting you again
I still love you,
I confess to you now
I wanna love you forever
If it is not late forever with me

Even though
my heart lived without you
for a long time
You still were in my heart
                        
                    |
