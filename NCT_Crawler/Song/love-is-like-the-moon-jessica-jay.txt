                        You asked me why
The moon is bright
But not the same as your heart
Coz I\'m here with you
And my love is true
Love is like the moon in your heart

How beautiful you\'ll see
This love in you and me
So beautilful you\'ll feel
That\'s how deep our love is real

Oh darlin\' darlin\' stand by me
Oh stand by me
And the moon is bright
And my love is true
Here with you

So darlin\' darlin\' stand by me
Oh stand by me
How beautiful 
You\'ll see
This love in you and me

So darlin\' darlin\' stand by me
Oh stand by me
And my love is deep
And the moon is bright
Here with you
                        
                    |
