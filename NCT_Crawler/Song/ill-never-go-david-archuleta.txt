                        Bài hát: I'll Never Go - David Archuleta

You always ask me
Those words I say
And tellin' me what it means to me
Every single day
You always act this way
For how many times I told you
I love you for this is all I know

Come to me and hold me
And you will see
The love I give
For you still hold the key
Every single day
You always act this way
For how many times I told you
I love you for this is all I know

I'll never go far away from you
Even the sky will tell you
That I need you so
For this is all I know
I'll never go far away from you

Come to me and hold me
And you will see
The love I give
For you still hold the key
Every single day
You always act this way
For how many times I told you
I love you for this is all I know

I'll never go far away from you
Even the sky will tell you
That I need you so
For this is all I know
I'll never go far away from you

I'll never go far away from you
Even the sky will tell you
That I need you so
For this is all I know
I'll never go far away from you

That I need you so
For this is all I know
I'll never go far away from you
That I need you so
For this is all I know
I'll never go far away from you
