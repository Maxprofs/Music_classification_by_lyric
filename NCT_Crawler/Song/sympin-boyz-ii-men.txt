                        That's the way you do it
 That's the way you do it
 That's the way you do it Baby let me tell you about how I feel
 This urge is seizing me, controlling it's unreal
 Ahh baby, I wanna let you know
 You got me yearning, so baby let me show Ooh, I want you baby
 Gotta know I need you here with me
 This ain't the right way
 Gotta find another way to earn your love
 Just give me a clue, 'cause you know Sympin' ain't easy
 Get on your hands and knees and lift your eyebrows
 Sympin' ain't easy
 And if you wanna get it, then you gotta be willin'
 Cryin', beggin', pleadin' on your knees Pardon my expression
 But the feeling I have is so strong
 I guess you know this isn't easy to do
 I keep tryin' and tryin' to give my love to you Ooh, I want you baby
 Gotta let you know I need you here with me
 This ain't the right way
 Gotta find another way to earn your love
 Just give me a clue, 'cause you know Sympin' ain't easy
 Get on your hands and knees and lift your eyebrows
 Sympin' ain't easy
 And if you wanna get it, you know you gotta be willing
 Cryin', beggin', pleadin' on your knees Sympin' ain't easy
 Get on your hands and knees and lift your eyebrows
 Sympin' ain't easy
 And if you wanna get it, then you gotta be willin'
 Cryin', beggin', pleadin' on your knees That's the way you do it
 That's the way you do it
 That's the way you do it Ooh, I want you baby
 Gotta let you know I need you here with me
 This ain't the right way
 Gotta find another way to earn your love
 Give me a clue Sympin' ain't easy
 Get on your hands and knees and lift your eyebrows
 Sympin' ain't easy
 And if you wanna get it, then you gotta be willin'
 Cryin', beggin', pleadin' on your knees Sympin' ain't easy
 Get on your hands and knees and lift your eyebrows
 Sympin' ain't easy
 And if you wanna get it, then you gotta be willin'
 Cryin', beggin', pleadin' on your knees Sympin' ain't easy
 Get on your hands and knees and lift your eyebrows
 Sympin' ain't easy
 And if you wanna get it, then you gotta be willin'
 Cryin', beggin', pleadin' on your knees Sympin' ain't
 Sympin' ain't
 Sympin' ain't
