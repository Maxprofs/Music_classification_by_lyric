                        It's time you see, the love you give
 Is killing me, and I wanna live
 This isn't right, search your soul for light So I turned and left, I told myself
 I could be, as bad as someone else
 But I find it hard, when an angel's on my right But you held my hand
 And took me right back down to hell
 I have an angel on my shoulder
 But a devil in my head But you held my hand
 And took me right back down to hell
 I have an angel on my shoulder
 But a devil in my head Won't you go, no means no
 Your dirty life, is like a one man show
 You're a night attack, you turn the light to black So I turned and left, I told myself
 I could be, as bad as someone else
 But I find it hard, when an angel's on my the right But you held my hand
 And took me right back down to hell
 I have an angel on my shoulder
 But a devil in my head But you held my hand
 And took me right back down to hell
 I have an angel on my shoulder
 But a devil in my head Talk to me, walk with me
 Come with me, beautiful lady
 Beautiful lady
 Will you come and save me?
 Come to me (Come back here)
 Walk with me (Come back here) But you held my hand
 And took me right back down to hell
 I have an angel on my shoulder
 But a devil in my head
 (Come back here) But you held my hand
 And took me right back down to hell
 I have an angel on my shoulder
 But a devil in my head
 (Come back here, come back here)
