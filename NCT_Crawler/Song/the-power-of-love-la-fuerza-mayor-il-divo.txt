:the power of love
:

The whispers in the morning
of lovers sleeping tight
Are rolling like thunder now
as I look in your eyes.
I hold on to your body
and feel each move you make.
Your voice is warm and tender
A love that I could not forsake.
Cause I am your lady
And you are my man.
Whenever you reach for me
I'll do all that I can.
We're heading for something
Somewhere I've never been.
Sometimes I am frightened but
I'm ready to learn
of the power of love.
Woo the power of love
The power of love
Lost is how I'm feeling
lying in your arms.
When the world outside's too much to take.
That all ends when I'm with you.
Even though there may be times
it seems I'm far away.
But never wonder where I am
The sound of your heart beating.
Made it clear suddenly.
The feeling that I can't go on
is light years away.
                        
                    |
