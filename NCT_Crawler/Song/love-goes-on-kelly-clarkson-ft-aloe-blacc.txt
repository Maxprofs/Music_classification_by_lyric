                        Bài hát: Love Goes On - Kelly Clarkson, Aloe Blacc

[Verse 1: Aloe Blacc]
If then was now
And I had you back somehow
I would hold you more
I should have told you more
If now was then
And we were together again
I would listen more
But now I miss you more

[Pre-Chorus: Aloe Blacc]
And never, I've been to a dark place
Stared loneliness in the face
At the lowest of my lows

[Chorus: Aloe Blacc & Kelly Clarkson]
There ain't nothin' so broken
Love can't heal, I feel
Every day I grow older
Time reveals, reveals
That nothing's really gone
We bring the past along
And love goes on
That nothing's really gone
We bring the past along
And love goes on

[Verse 2: Kelly Clarkson]
In my dreams
You would come to me
Through the door
Like before
When I wake
Every breath I take
Is for you
Now would do

[Pre-Chorus: Kelly Clarkson & Aloe Blacc]
Whatever to look upon your face
I wish I could change my place
Will this pain ever go?

[Chorus: Aloe Blacc & Kelly Clarkson]
There ain't nothin' so broken
Love can't heal, I feel
Every day I grow older
Time reveals, reveals
That nothing's really gone
We bring the past along
And love goes on
That nothing's really gone
We bring the past along
And love goes on

[Bridge: Aloe Blacc & Kelly Clarkson]
How do I fill this emptiness?
How do I fill this emptiness?
This heaviness I bear
This heaviness I bear
How do I go on giving my all
When part of me isn't there?
Yeah
Oh, baby

[Chorus: Aloe Blacc & Kelly Clarkson]
There ain't nothin' so broken
Love can't heal, I feel
Every day I grow older
Time reveals, reveals
That nothing's really gone
We bring the past along
And love goes on
That nothing's really gone
We bring the past along
And love goes on
                        
                    |
