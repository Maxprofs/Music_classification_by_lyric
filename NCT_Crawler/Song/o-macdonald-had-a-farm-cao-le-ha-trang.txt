                        Bài hát : O Macdonald Had A Farm - Cao Lê Hà Trang

Old MacDonald had a farm, eee-yi-eee-yi-oh
And on this farm he had a cow, eee-yi-eee-yi-oh
With a moo moo here and a moo moo there
Here a moo, there a moo, everywhere a moo moo
Old Mac Donald had a farm, eee-yi-eee-yi-oh
Old MacDonald had a farm, eee-yi-eee-yi-oh
And on this farm he had a pig, eee-yi-eee-yi-oh
With an oink, oink here and an oink, oink there
Here an oink, there an oink, everywhere an oink, oink
Old Mac Donald had a farm, eee-yi-eee-yi-oh
Now other folks have animals they are caring for
Let's meet some different people and sing a little more
Henrietta had a house, eee-yi-eee-yi-oh
And in this house she had a cat, eee-yi-eee-yi-oh
With a mew, mew, here and a mew, mew, there
Here a mew, there a mew, everywhere a mew, mew
Henrietta had a house, eee-yi-eee-yi-oh
Zebadiah had a zoo, eee-yi-eee-yi-oh
And in this zoo he had a tiger, eee-yi-eee-yi-oh
With a grrr, grrr, here and a grrr, grrr, there
Here a grrr, there a grrr, everywhere a grrr, grrr,
Zebadiah had a zoo, eee-yi-eee-yi-oh
Pamelina had a pet shop, eee-yi-eee-yi-oh
And in this shop she had a puppy, eee-yi-eee-yi-oh
With a woof, woof, here and a woof, woof, there
Here a woof, there a woof, everywhere a woof, woof,
Pamelina had a pet shop, eee-yi-eee-yi-oh
With a moo, moo, here and a moo, moo, there
An oink, oink, here and an oink, oink, there
A mew, mew, here and a mew, mew, there
A grrr, grrr, here and a grrr, grrr, there
A woof, woof, here and a woof, woof, there
Animals are everywhere, eee-yi-eee-yi-oh!
