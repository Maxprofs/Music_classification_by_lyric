                        Bài hát: Towards The Sun (From The "Home" Soundtrack) - Rihanna

Turn your face towards the sun
Let the shadows fall behind you
Tell a pray, just carry on
And the shadows will never find you

Turn your face towards the sun
Let the shadows fall behind you
Don't look back, just carry on
And the shadows will never find you

[Verse 1]
Lost on a rocky road
Got lost in the promise of a love I never know
Shadows chase me far from home
I remember when my heart was filled gold
And you knew I been burned, I been burned, I been burned
You see me lose control
It's not worth, it's not worth, it's not worth
My soul

[Chorus]
Turn your face towards the sun
Let the shadows fall behind you
Don't look back, just carry on
And the shadows will never find you

[Verse 2]
Lost my faith in trust
You and I know gold long turn to rust
I still swear that we can reign like the kings and queens of better yesterday
Don't you know
I been burned, I been burned, I been burned
You see me lose control
It's not worth, it's not worth, it's not worth
My soul

[Chorus]
Turn your face towards the sun
Let the shadows fall behind you
Don't look back, just carry on
And the shadows will never find you

[Bridge]
Where you gonna go
Where you gonna go
Where you gonna run to
When you get to the end of the night
This time you'll face the sky

[Chorus]
Turn your face towards the sun
Let the shadows fall behind you
Don't look back, just carry on
And the shadows will never find you

Turn your face towards the sun
Let the shadows fall behind you
Don't look back, just carry on
And the shadows will never find you
Turn your face towards the sun
Let the shadows fall behind you
                        
                    |
