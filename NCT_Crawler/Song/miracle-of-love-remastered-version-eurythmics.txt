                        How many sorrows do you try to hide in a world of illusion that's covering your mind?
 I'll show you something good, oh I'll show you something good
 When you open your mind you'll discover the sign that there's something you're longing to find
 The miracle of love will take away your pain when the miracle of love comes your way again
 Cruel is the night that covers up your fears
 Tender is the one that wipes away your tears
 There must be a bitter breeze to make you sting so viciously
 They say the greatest coward can hurt the most ferociously
 I'll show you something good, oh I'll show you something good
 If you open your heart you can make a new start when your crumbling world falls apart
 The miracle of love will take away your pain when the miracle of love comes your way again
 The miracle of love ((Must take a miracle) Must take a miracle), will take away your pain (Must take a miracle)
 When the miracle of love (Must take a miracle (A miracle)), comes your way again (Must take a miracle)

 The miracle of love will take away your pain (In this heartless world)
 When the miracle of love comes your way again (And now it lasts, I now it lasts)
 The miracle of love will take away your pain (People turn and hurt you, they try to hurt you if they could)
 When the miracle of love comes your way again (And it must take a miracle)
 The miracle of love (Must take a miracle), will take away your pain (Must take a miracle)
 When the miracle of love (Must take a miracle), comes your way again (Must take a miracle)
 The miracle of love (Must take a miracle), will take away your pain (Must take a miracle)
 When the miracle of love (Must take a miracle), comes your way again (Must take a miracle)
 The miracle of love (Must take a miracle), will take away your pain (Must take a miracle)
 When the miracle of love (Must take a miracle), comes your way again
