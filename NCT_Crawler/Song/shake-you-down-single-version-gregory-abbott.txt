                        Ooooh Ooooh
 Yeaaaaaah

 Girl, I've been watching you
 From so far across the floor now baby
 That's nothing new I've watched you
 So many times before now baby
 I see that look in your eyes (look in yor eyes)
 And what it's telling me
 And you know, oooh girl that I'm not shy
 I'm glad you picked up on my telepathy, now baby

 Chorus
 You read my mind (You know you did)
 Girl I wanna shake you down (well oh well)
 I can give you all the loving you need
 (I'm gonna love you)
 Come on let me take you down (oh, baby)
 We'll go all the way to heaven

 Ooooh I've been missing you
 And the way you make me feel inside
 What can I do? I can tell you've got your pride now baby
 Come to me (well well) let me ease your mind (oh babe)
 I've got the remedy, yes I do
 Now give me just a little time

 Chorus

 Spoken
 Girl, I've been missing you
 And you know it's funny everytime I get to feelin this way
 I wish I had you near me, I wanna reach out and touch you...

 Rap
 I can't stop thinking of the things we do
 The way you call me baby when I'm holding you
 I shake and I shiver when I know you're near
 Then you whisper in my ear (oh baby)

 Chorus out
                        
                    |
