                        Baby we can talk all night
 But that ain't getting us nowhere
 I told you everything I possibly can
 There's nothin' left inside of here And maybe you can cry all night
 But that'll never change the way that I feel
 The snow is really piling up outside
 I wish you wouldn't make me leave here I poured it on and I poured it out
 I tried to show you just how much I care
 I'm tired of words and I'm too hoarse to shout
 But you've been cold to me so long
 I'm cryin' icicles instead of tears
 And all I can do is keep on tellin' you I want you, oh, I need you
 But there ain't no way I'm ever gonna love you
 Now don't be sad, oh, 'cause two out of three ain't bad
 Now don't be sad no 'cause two out of three ain't bad You'll never find your gold on a sandy beach
 You'll never drill for oil on a city street
 I know you're lookin' for a ruby in a mountain of rocks
 But there ain't no Coupe de Ville hidin'
 At the bottom of a cracker jack box I can't lie, I can't tell you that I'm somethin' I'm not
 No matter how I try, I'll never be able
 To give you somethin', somethin' that I just haven't got Well, there's only one girl I will ever love
 That was so many year ago
 And though I know I'll never get her out of my heart
 Never loved me back, ooh I know I remember how she left me on a stormy night
 She kissed me and got out of our bed
 And though I pleaded and I begged her not to walk out that door
 She packed her bags and turned right away
 And she kept on tellin' me, kept on tellin' me, kept on tellin' me I want you, oh, I need you
 But there ain't no way I'm ever gonna love you
 Now don't be sad no, oh, 'cause two out of three ain't bad I want you, oh, I need you
 But there ain't no way I'm ever gonna love you
 Now don't, now don't, now don't look at me on your bed, on your bed
 Now don't be sad no, oh, 'cause two out of three ain't bad Baby we can talk all night
 But that ain't getting us nowhere
