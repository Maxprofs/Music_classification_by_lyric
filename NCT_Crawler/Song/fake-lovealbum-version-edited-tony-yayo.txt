                        [Intro]
 My life..
 My life..
 My life..
 My life..

 [Tony Yayo Intro]
 Yeah..
 Yeah..
 Yeah..

 [Chorus]
 Fake love's when your homie give you dap
 Smile in your face but he wants your ass clapped
 Fake love..
 Fake love's when they never be around
 But once you get rich, they all get down
 Fake love..
 Fake love's when your friend *** your bitch
 Don't think with his head only think with his dick
 Fake love..
 So my friends enemies and my enemies be friends
 Dont show no love, don't pretend

 [Verse]
 50 got Yayo gettin' all this cash
 Now all these Yes men wanna ***
 But back in the street you aint help me re-up
 Locked up, i had court dates, you never showed up
 What the ***, tell me what you grinnin' at nigga
 If i get killed, my stash, you spendin' that nigga
 Some people want nutin' outta life
 And some people want it all, let's ball
 I see the jealousy and envy when you see me shoppin'
 Saphire watch, got your jaw droppin'
 When i move that 8th, you were 7 gram coppin'
 You ain't happy for me, you hope that the Feds watchin'
 I aint stoppin, homie i'm number one
 Why you schemin' on me, i'm plain and dumb
 So when it comes to the point, that you ready to flip
 I'ma pull out first, and let off my clip, Take That!

 [Chorus]
 Fake love's when your homie give you dap
 Smile in your face but he wants your ass clapped
 Fake love..
 Fake love's when they never be around
 But once you get rich, they all get down
 Fake love..
 Fake love's when your friend *** your bitch
 Don't think with his head only think with his dick
 Fake love..
 So my friends enemies and my enemies be friends
 Dont show no love, don't pretend

 [Verse]
 Now your man ain't your man if he extortin' you nigga
 And your man ain't your man if he shortenin' you nigga
 Listen money talks, and bull*** run marathons
 When your money's gone, thats when them hoes gon'
 Fake love is when a nigga sets you up
 How he knew about your chain when your ching was tucked
 You know the type that rats you out, sell you out
 Get locked, your man ain't gon' bail you out
 You got a brand new whip, your *** is lovely
 Yeah it's aight, but its rims is ugly
 Fake friends, show fake love
 You know the type of nigga that'll leave you in the club
 Fake love..

 [Chorus]
 Fake love's when your homie give you dap
 Smile in your face but he wants your ass clapped
 Fake love..
 Fake love's when they never be around
 But once you get rich, they all get down
 Fake love..
 Fake love's when your friend *** your bitch
 Don't think with his head only think with his dick
 Fake love..
 So my friends enemies and my enemies be friends
 Dont show no love, don't pretend
                        
                    |
