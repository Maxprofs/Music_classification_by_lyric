                        Me And You - Lucky Twice

You’ve been all around the world in search of life
And I’ve been lying on the bed, time floating by
I’m a slacker, you’re always first to act.
But daddy used to say that opposites attract
We’re always gonna make it
We never have to fake it
And nothing’s gonna brake it
We just laugh about it
We just laugh about it
We’re always gonna make it
We never have to fake it
And nothing’s gonna brake it
We just laugh about it
We just laugh about it
You go all around the world, I go to sleep
You belive in being there, I like to dream
Seem we never seem to go our separate ways
Every night you’re back with “Honey, How’s your day?”
Me and you
We’re are always wanna make it
Keep it true
We never have to fake it
I like you
And nothing gonna’s brake it
We just laugh about it we just laugh about it
Me and you
We’re always gonna make it
Keep it true
We never have to fake it
I like you
And nothing’s gonna brake it
We just laugh about it we just laugh about it
You swim the everglades wearing you roller blades
You climp the everest twice a day
I read a magazine, stare at the silver screen
We just laugh about it we just laugh about it
We just laugh about it we just laugh about it
Me and you
We’re always wanna make it
Keep it true
We never have to fake it
I like you
And nothing’s gonna brake it
We just laugh about it we just laugh about it
Me and you
Keep it true
I like you
