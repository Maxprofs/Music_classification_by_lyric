                        Bài hát: Happy - Walk Off The Earth, Parachute

[Verse 1:]
It might seem crazy what I'm about to say
Sunshine she's here, you can take a break
I'm a hot air balloon that could go to space
With the air, like I don't care baby by the way.

[Hook:]
Because I'm happy
Clap along if you feel like a room without a roof
Because I'm happy
Clap along if you feel like happiness is the truth
Because I'm happy
Clap along if you know what happiness is to you
Because I'm happy
Clap along if you feel like that's what you wanna do.

[Verse 2:]
Here come bad news talking this and that
Yeah, give me all you got, don't hold back
Yeah, well I should probably warn you I'll be just fine
Yeah, no offense to you don't waste your time.
Here's why

[Hook:]

[Bridge:]
Happy, come on, bring me down
Happy, come on, bring me down
Happy lyrics on ***
Love is too happy to bring me down
Come on, bring me down
I said bring me down
Come on, bring me down
Love is too happy to bring me down
Come on, bring me down
I said.

[Hook x2:]

[Bridge 2:]
Bring me down... can't nothing...
Bring me down... your love is too high...
Bring me down... can't nothing...
Bring me down, I said (let me tell you now).

[Hook x2:]
