                        Holier Than Thou
Artist: Metallica

No more !
the *** rolls out your mouth again
haven't changed your brain is still gelatin
little whispers circle around your head
why don't you worry about yourself instead
who are you?where ya been?where ya from?
Gossip is burning on the tip of your tongue
you lie so much you believe yourself
judge not lest ye be judged yourself
houler than thou
you are
holier than thou
you are
you know not
before you judge me take a look at you
can't you find something better to do
point the finger slow to understand
arrogance and ignorance go hand in hand
it's not who you are it's who you konw
others lives are the basis of you owin
burn your bridges build them back with wealth
judge not lest ye be judged yourself
holier than thou
you are
holier than thou
you are
you know not
houler than thou
you are
holier than thou
you are
you know not
