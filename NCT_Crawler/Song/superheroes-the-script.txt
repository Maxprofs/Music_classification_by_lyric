                        All the lies she has seen
All the meaner side of me
They took away the profits dream for a profit on the street
Now she’s stronger than you know
A heart of steel starts to grow

All his lies he's been told
He’ll be nothing when he’s old
All the kicks and all the blows
He will never let it show
Cause he’s stronger than you know
A heart of steel starts to grow

When you've been fighting for it all your life
You've been struggling to make things right
That’s how a superhero learns to fly
Every day, every hour
Turn the pain into power

When you've fighting for it all your life
You've been working every day and night
That’s how a superhero learns to fly
Every day, every hour
Turn the pain into power

All the hurt, all the lies
All the tears that they cry
When the moment tears just right
They seem fire in their eyes
Cause he’s stronger than you know
A heart of steel starts to grow

When you've been fighting for it all your life
You've been struggling to make things right
That’s how a superhero learns to fly
Every day, every hour
Turn the pain into power

When you've fighting for it all your life
You've been working every day and night
That’s how a superhero learns to fly
Every day, every hour
Turn the pain into power

Every day, every hour
Turn the pain into power
Every day, every hour
Turn the pain into power

She's got lion in her heart
A fire in her soul
He's a got a beast in his belly
That's so hard to control
Cause they've taken too much hits
Taking blow by blow
Now light them match up like watch them explode
She's got lion in her heart
A fire in her soul
He's a got a beast in his belly
That's so hard to control
Cause they've taken too much hits
Taking blow by blow
Now light them match up like watch them explode

When you've been fighting for it all your life
You've been struggling to make things right
That’s a how a superhero learns to fly
Every day, every hour
Turn the pain into power

When you've fighting for it all your life
You've been working every day and night
That’s a how a superhero learns to fly
Every day, every hour
Turn the pain into power

Oh yeah....

Every day, every hour
Turn the pain into power

Ooh yeah
Woah

Every day, every hour
Turn the pain into power
When you've been fighting for it all your life
You've been struggling to make things right
That’s how a superhero learns to fly
