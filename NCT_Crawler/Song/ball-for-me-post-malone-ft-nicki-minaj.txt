[Intro: Post Malone]
Uh, woah, for me

[Pre-Chorus: Post Malone]
Baby, could you? I got too much on my mind right now
I ain't got the time to get you Saint Laurent down
Could you? I got too much on my mind right now
Time to hit Rodeo, give my baby 30 thou'

[Chorus: Post Malone]
Oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-ooh, ball for me

I'm on the road, I'm gettin' paid, like what you want, baby? (What you want, baby?)
You're bougie, baby, but I love you, baby, give you the world, baby (you the world, baby)
Paid five grand for a handbag, that's Saint Laurent, baby (Saint Laurent, baby)
Damn, you love that money, baby (oh-oh-oh)
Hunnid thousand plus hunnid thousand, my whip (my whip, my whip)
30 thousand plus 30 thousand, my wrist (my wrist, my wrist)
We got alcohol, plus bad bitches, that's lit (that's lit, that's lit)
I swear, baby, we was just kissin', that's it (that's it, that's it)
How could I forget the *** that you done done for me? (For me)
Baby gonna take the charge and take the fall for me (for me)
Would love to take you shoppin', but girl, I'll be on tour
Sorry, lil' mama, I can't give you more

[Pre-Chorus: Post Malone]
Baby, could you? I got too much on my mind right now
I ain't got the time to get you Saint Laurent down
Could you? I got too much on my mind right now

Oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-ooh, ball for me
Oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-ooh, b-ball for me, yeah

[Verse 2: Nicki Minaj]
Yo, gotta hit him on the jack
When you comin' back? Where is you at on the map?
Everything is intact
Coulda been a seamstress, still wouldn't cut him slack
Pretty much, ain't got a clue
Itty bitty piggyback off everything I do
But I'm still droppin' jaws
Got 'em lookin' like James Harden at the awards
Back to you, I'm so into ya
For real, breh like I'm kin to ya
If you a 10, I add 10 to ya
They be mad when I tend to ya
That's what the bae like
Call me Buffy 'cause that's what I slay like
These bitches, I son 'em like it's daylight
These niggas wanna know what it tastes like
What it tastes like, yo, what it tastes like, yo'
They wanna know what it tastes like, yo'
All this ice, it should taste like snow
Get kimonos and let's fly to Tokyo
Pretty, pretty please baby, won't you cop this for me? Uh

[Pre-Chorus: Post Malone]
Baby, could you? I got too much on my mind right now
I ain't got the time to get you Saint Laurent down
Could you? I got too much on my mind right now
Time to hit Rodeo, give my baby 30 thou'

[Chorus: Post Malone & Nicki Minaj]
Oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-ooh, ball for me
Oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-ooh, b-ball for me, yeah
Oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-ooh, ball for me
Oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-ooh, b-ball for me, yeah
Oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-ooh, ball for me (what it tastes like)
Oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-ooh, b-ball for me, yeah
Oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-ooh, ball for me (what it tastes like)
Oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo-ooh, b-ball for me, yeah
