                        Bài hát: Stay - Hurts

1. My whole life waiting for the right time
To tell you how I feel
Know I try to tell you that I need you
Here I am without you
I feel so lost but what can I do
Cause I know this love seems real
But I don't know how to feel.

[Chorus:]
We say goodbye in the pouring rain
And I break down as you walk away
Stay, stay
Cause all my life I felt this way
But I could never find the words to say
Stay, stay...

2. Alright, everything is alright
Since you came along
And before you
I had nowhere to run to
Nothing to hold on to
I came so close to giving it up
Stay lyrics on ***
And I wonder if you know
How it feels to let you go?

[Bridge:]
So you change your mind
And say you're mine
Don't leave tonight
Stay...

[Coda:]
Stay with me, stay with me
Stay with me, stay with me
Stay, stay, stay, stay with me.
