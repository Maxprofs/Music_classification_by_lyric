                        Bài hát: Not A Love Song - Bulow

You're always on my mind
I think about you all the time
Um, no

Let's not talk about it
Drama: we can live without it
Catch a wave if we're bored
There's a clock we'll ignore
Find a way around it

Hey girl, I can tell there's something
Even when you say it's nothing
When you're playing with your hair
Like you just don't care
It's a tell you're bluffing
Now please don't take this the wrong way

I love the things you do
It's how you do the things you love
But it's not a love song, not a love song

I love the way you get me
But correct me
If I'm wrong
This is not a love song, not a love song

I love that you buy the tickets
And you don't make me watch a chick flick
We've come so far
Being just the way we are
If it's not broke don't fix it

I can't guess the meaning
When you don't say what you're feeling
If you got a broken heart,
You can punch me in the arm
Now that's what you're needing (that's what you needed)
Don't take this the wrong way (nope)

I love the things you do
It's how you do the things you love
But it's not a love song, not a love song

I love the way you get me
But correct me
If I'm wrong
This is not a love song, not a love song

I don't speak, girl
Like "Hey girl!"
I don't quite understand a manicure
But you're the only friend I'd take a shower for (and I would really do that for you)
And I would hold your bags when you go shopping
What a guy (what a guy, what a guy, what a guy)
What a guy!

I love the things you do
It's how you do the things you love
The way you say it,
Put me through it
I guess I always knew it (I always knew)

I love the way you get me
But correct me
If I'm wrong
This is not a love song, not a love song

I love the things you do,
It's how you do the things you love
But it's not a love song (no, definitely not a love song)
Not a love song

I love the way you get me
But correct me,
If I'm wrong
This is not a love song (it's not a love song)
Not a love song
This is not a love song (it's not a love song)
Not a love song
This is not a love song (it's not a love song)
Not a love song
