Pretty green bud all in my blunt
Oh, I need it
We can take off, yeah, now
Oh, marijuana, yeah

Pretty green bud all in my blunt
Oh, I need it
We can take off, yeah
Oh, do you wanna smoke?

I, I, I be on it all day love it like my nigga Big Boi said
That's the only thing that keeps me level up in my crazy head
Stoned on the run, run, no fun if not, it's Scotty from the hate mail read
I swear to keep it hundred if I ain't have it then I'd be dead

My soul's been fed tonight
Everything that I choose still can't forget Grey Goose
Converse covered with mixer juice
And all my niggas rollin' up in the booth

Who got me on another on
Someone please roll me another one
They tell me all good things must end
Well those muthafucka's ain't have this friend
I keep it

Pretty green bud all in my blunt
Oh, I need it
We can take off, yeah, now
Oh, marijuana, yeah

Pretty green bud all in my blunt
Oh, I need it
We can take off, yeah
Oh, I know you wanna smoke

Marijuana
I know you wanna smoke

Pretty green bud all in my blunt
Oh, I need it
We can take off, yeah
Oh, marijuana, yeah

Pretty green bud all in my blunt
Oh, I need it
We can take off, yeah
Oh, I know you wanna smoke

Always had my back, hey
Always had my back, hey
Always had my back, hey
Marijuana had my back, yeah

Always had my back, yeah
Always had my back, hey
Always had my back, hey
Marijuana had my back, my back, whoa

Never left me lonely
It's gon' be okay
Trust me, it's gon' be okay
