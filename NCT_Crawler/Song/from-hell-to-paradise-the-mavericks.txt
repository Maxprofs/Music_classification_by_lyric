                        For thirty years they sang the
 Song of promised victory
 But who they've fought and who has won
 Didn't matter much to me Oh, I see them driving down the streets
 In their fancy shiny cars
 Crowds of people to their feet
 And their faces full of scars No pleasantries, no luxuries
 And no little children's milk
 While minister's wives spent
 All their lives in China's finest silk Well, my back's been broken many times
 But my spirit lingers on
 The day it comes my way on
 Freedom's ship I will be gone From hell to paradise
 I'll always pay the price
 From hell to paradise
 I'll always pay the price This ninety mile trip
 Has taken thirty years to make
 They tried to keep forever
 What was never theirs to take Well, I cursed and scratched the Devil's hand
 As he stood in front of me
 Had one last drag from his big cigar
 And he finally set me free From hell to paradise
 I'll always pay the price
 From hell to paradise
 I'll always pay the price From hell to paradise
 I'll always pay the price
 From hell to paradise
 I'll always pay the price Con ojos tiernos algun dia te mirare
 Con brases abiertos algun dia abrasare
 Hay mi Havana cuando pueda regresare
