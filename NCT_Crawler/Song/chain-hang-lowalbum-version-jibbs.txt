                        [Kids]
 Beasta!

 Do yo chain hang low
 Do it wobble to the floor
 Do it shine in the light
 Is it platinum, Is it gold
 Could you throw it over your shoulda
 If you hot it make you cold
 Do your chain hang low

 Is that your chain!?
 Bout 24 inches is how low I let it hang
 Hop out the ride and let the diamonds smoke off the range
 Just by the chain you can tell the big kid do his thang.
 You know the name!

 Is that your chain!?
 Bout 24 inches is how low I let it hang
 Hop out the ride and let the diamonds smoke off the range
 Just by the chain you can tell the big kid do a stain
 I'm off the chain!

 [Verse:]
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
 I'm hot kid
 Chain so low you would think that diamonds never stop it
 And it's funny cause you could never stop it
 A bunch of rocks on my hand and I aint even own a block yet
 Show em white gold sorta hold em like my tims
 And a chain hang 24 inches like the rims
 Diamonds all blown up yeah sorta like a pimp
 So when the light hit the ice
 It starts glistening off the tims (off the tims)

 My chain hang
 All it do is blang blang
 Half blue, Half red
 Like my diamonds gang bang
 And don't even think
 We on the same page
 Charms so heavy they couldn't lift it till the crane came

 [Chorus:]
 Do yo chain hang low
 Do it wobble to the floor
 Do it shine in the light
 Is it platinum, Is it gold
 Could you throw it over ya shoulda
 If you hot it make you cold
 Do your chain hang low

 Do yo chain hang low
 Do it wobble to the floor
 Do it shine in the light
 Is it platinum, Is it gold
 Could you throw it ov'are ya shoulda
 If you hot it make you cold
 Do your chain hang low

 [Verse 2:]
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
 I'm so icy (do yo chain)
 My chain so heavy that my neck don't like me (do yo chain)
 Go n no no no is not a game kid (do yo chain)
 Cause I throw my chain in the crowd (do do do do do do yo chain)
 And I growl like game

 Diamonds is nothing to me
 (do yo chain) Especially when I'm dressing up
 Is just a button to me
 Bling! (could you thro it over yo shoulda) and not to mention my teeth
 Cause they color coordinated
 Complimenting the tee

 So check out my swag
 Diamonds red, white, n blue like the American flag
 Boy (do yo chain) is so colorful
 N see I got that nice screen
 My money spend on jewels
 I call it my ice cream (chain, chain, chain, chain)

 My music give you black eye
 'cause of the beating
 They think I am a mutant
 The way a boy is beesting (chain, chain, chain, chain)
 I stay when n sometime you call it cheating
 Yeah, my boys always around
 Like it's a mee-ting

 Is that your (do yo chain) chain!?
 Bout 24 inches is how low I let it hang (do yo chain)
 How bout the ride n let the diamonds smoke off the range (do yo chain)
 Just by the chain you can tell the big kid do a stain (do yo chain)
 You know the name! (do do do do do do yo chain)

 Is that your chain!?
