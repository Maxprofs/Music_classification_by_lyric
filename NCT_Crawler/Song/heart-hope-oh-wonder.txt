                        Bài hát: Heart Hope - Oh Wonder

They're building towers that are high enough to see the clouds
But it don't bother me
The elevators working overtime up and down
Yet it don't bother me
Cause I need something more than everything
A higher self deep within
Cause I need something more than everything
A higher self, a higher self
And I know we need a little heart hope
I know we've gotta outgrow and feel a little heart hope
They're building aeroplanes faster than the speed of light
Yet it don't bother me
The endless cities multiplying out oceansize
Yet it don't bother me
Cause I need something more than everything
A higher self deep within
Cause I need something more than everything
A higher self, a higher self
And I know we need a little heart hope
I know we've gotta outgrow and feel a little heart hope
Cause there is something more than everything
So feel the love and let it in
Cause I know we need a little heart hope
And I know we need a little heart hope
I know we've gotta outgrow and feel a little heart hope
Cause there is something more than everything
So feel the love and let it in
Cause I know we need a little heart hope
                        
                    |
