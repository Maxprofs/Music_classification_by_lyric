                        Bài hát: Wings - Haerts

I will never let you go
I know you want it, know you want it
Learning love means not to know
I'll learn to take it, learn to take it

[Hook]
Love
Love

[Verse 2]
I will never leave your fears
I know you're lost now, know you're lost now
Counting days won't buy us years
Let’s start it over, start it over

[Hook - Variation]
Love
(I'm never gonna let the magic go)
(I'll melt away into your afterglow)
Love
(I'm never gonna let the magic go)
(I'll melt away into your afterglow)
(The sky will melt in tears)
(I'll melt away into your afterglow)
(The sky will melt in tears)
(I'll melt away into your afterglow)

[Bridge]
People never smile to say goodbye
Leaving means there’s nothing left to try
But I broke my wings for you
I smiled as you untied our love for good

[Hook - Variation]
Good
Good
(The sky will melt in tears)
(I'll slow away into your afterglow)
(The sky will melt in tears)
(I'll melt away into your afterglow)
(The sky will melt in tears)
(I'll melt away into your afterglow)
(The sky will melt in tears)
(I'll slow away into your afterglow)
