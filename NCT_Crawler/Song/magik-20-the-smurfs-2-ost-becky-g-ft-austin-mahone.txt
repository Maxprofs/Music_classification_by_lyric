                        Verse 1:
Abracadabra
Call me mind master
I cast a spell on every beat
The rabbits out the hat, huh
Every show a new surprise
I leave them mesmerised
Got all the fellas hypnotised
With all my magic lines
I’m a magician
Yes to soy tu mago
Si quieres ver mi magia
Nomas me dices cuando
Soon you’ll start to believe
Open your eyes and see
It’s Austin Mahone and Becky G

Chorus:
I got the magic in me
Every time I tought that track, it turns into gold
Everybody knows I’ve got the magic in me
When I hit the floor the girls come snapping at me
Now everybody wants a blast of
Magik, magik, magik
Magik, magik, magik
Magik, magik, magik
Ahoooh
I got the magic in me

Verse 2:
I got some tricks up my sleeve
Just wait and see
Come little closer
Close your eyes and count to three
Open, voila, so spectacular
I even got magic to make the haters disappear
I got my rhymes
They’re like my special potion
So when I start to rap them
The whole track starts turning golden
And now I’m through
It’s the end of verse two
Like bipadee bopidee doo

Chorus:
I got the magic in me (I got the magic baby)
Every time I tought that track, it turns into gold (Yes, it turns to gold)
Everybody knows I’ve got the magic in me (I got the magic baby)
When I hit the floor the girls come snapping at me (they be snapping baby)
Now everybody wants a blast of
Magik, magik, magik
Magik, magik, magik
Magik, magik, magik
Ahoooh
I got the magic in me
I got the magic in me
Magik, magik, magik
Magik, magik, magik
Magik, magik, magik, (ma, ma, ma, ma..)

I got the magic in me (I got the magic baby)
Every time I tought that track, it turns into gold (Yes, it turns to gold)
Everybody knows I’ve got the magic in me (I got the magic baby)
When I hit the floor the girls come snapping at me (they be snapping baby)
Now everybody wants a blast of
Magik, magik, magik
Magik, magik, magik
Magik, magik, magik
Ahoooh
I got the magic in me
                        
                    |
