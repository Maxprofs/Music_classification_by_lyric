                        Bài hát: Save Me - Hollywood Undead

[Danny:]
Don't even try to save me tonight
Don't even try to save me tonight
Don't even try to save me tonight
Cause I don't know
No I don't know
But here I go
Here I go
Here I go
But here I go
Here I go

[J-Dog:]
Love's a drug, I'm an addict
Ditch my heart just to kick the habit
People might think I'm problematic
*** it I'm alone in a world of static
Tragic but I stand alone
With an empty chest it's a dial tone
And I must confess so pick up the phone
And If there's nothing left, then I'm leaving home
Living in the shadow of someone else
Till I took a deep breath and I found myself
Heard the bang from the ricochet
Maybe I was born just a cast away

[Charlie Scene and Danny:]
I'll stay away from
This pain I came from
Can't run away from
What's been said and done
With all these days gone
Been fighting so long
I can't break away from it all

[Danny:]
Don't even try to save me tonight
Don't even try to save me tonight
Don't even try to save me tonight
Cause I don't know
No I don't know
But here I go
Here I go
Here I go
But here I go
Here I go

[Johnny 3 Tears:]
So easy to hate with no one to love
It's hard to dream what I'm thinking of
So hard to watch when I'm starting to run
And now it's all over, overdone
I'm just a victim with this, sickness within
I'm just a memory faded slowly and only the lonely know me
Stand on top of a building so
Staring down now with the world below
Half way to heaven with nowhere to go
Can anybody out there help me?
No

[Charlie Scene and Danny:]
I'll stay away from
This pain I came from
Can't run away from
What's been said and done
With all these days gone
Been fighting so long
I can't break away from it all

[Danny:]
Don't even try to save me tonight
Don't even try to save me tonight
Don't even try to save me tonight
Cause I don't know
No I don't know
Don't even try to save me tonight
Don't even try to save me tonight
Don't even try to save me tonight
Cause I don't know
No I don't know
But here I go
All those times without you, out you
Here I go
All those times without you
But here I go
All those times without you, out you
All those times without you
Here I go
Oooohhhh
But here I go
Oooohhhh
Here I go
