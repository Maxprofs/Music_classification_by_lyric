                        [Verse 1: 2 Chainz]
Money's the motivation – money's the conversation
You on vacation, we gettin' paid, so...
We don't placate ‘em, I did it for the fam'
It's whatever we had to do, it's just who I am
Yeah – it's the life I chose
Gunshots in the dark, one eye closed
And we got it cookin' like a one-eyed stove
You can catch me kissin' my girl with both eyes closed
Perfectin' my passion, thanks for askin'
Couldn't slow down so we had to crash it
You use plastic, we 'bout cash
I see some people ahead that we gon' pass, yeah!

[Hook]
I never fear death or dying
I only fear never trying
I am whatever I am
Only God can judge me now
One shot, everything rides on
Tonight, even if I've got
Three strikes, I'mma go for it
This moment, we own it
And I'm not to be played with
Because it could get dangerous
See these people I ride with
This moment, we own it

[Verse 2: Wiz]
And the same ones I ride with be the same ones that I die with
Put it all out on the line with
If you lookin' for me you can find Wiz
In the new car or the Crown with my new broad
That's a fine chick, and the Weather Squad, I'm down with
Ain't no way around it
What you say? Tell me what you say?
Workin' hard, reppin' for my dawgs, so this every day
Takin' off, lookin' out for all, makin' sure we ball like the mob
All you do is call, catch you if you fall, Young Khalifa

[Hook]

[Verse 3: 2 Chainz]
This the biggest day of my life
We got big guns, been graduated from knives
Day in the life, and I'm ready to ride
Got the spirit, I'm feelin' like a killer inside
Or – financial outbreak, I'm free but I ain't out yet
Ridin' with the plug so I'm close to the outlet
At the red light, rims, sittin' on the set
I look better on your girl than her outfit

[Verse 4: Wiz]
Stuck to the plan, always said that we would stand up
Never ran, we the fam, and loyalty never change up
Been down since day one, look at where we came from
Jumpin' out on anybody who try to say somethin'
One thing about it, got a problem? I've got the same one
Money rolls we fold, plenty clubs we close, follow the same code
Never turn our backs, our cars don't even lose control

[Outro]
One shot, everything rides on
Tonight, even if I've got
Three strikes, I'mma go for it
This moment, we own it
And I'm not to be played with
Because it could get dangerous
See these people I ride with
This moment, we own it
