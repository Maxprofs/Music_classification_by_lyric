                        Okay, okay, okay
 Told her bust it open she said okay
 But what she wearin? Chanel & Dolce
 How she want it? Beat up like O.J
 Skurt, skurt on a bitch nigga
 How much time do you got for a rich nigga?
 I need that while I'm relaxin' and the bitch knows gymnastics
 So kickin' up out her legs on this dick like a fraction
 Right, right, left, hit 'em with that right, left
 I got that best stroker, I don't need no pipe test
 My dick work girl I don't need no mic check
 No panties on I can see your pussy through that white dress
 I ain't trippin baby girl make that money
 Cause if I *** her right she just might give some to me
 And better yet, *** with me for better sex
 I know all the right spots to keep that punani wet Girl you know you look fine when you stare like that
 You know I bought you that Chanel right?
 You know I *** you like I'm fresh outta of jail right?
 And if you cheated on me I won't care right?
 (She make that ass go)
 Left, Left, Right
 Right, Left, Left, Right
 (She make that ass go)
 Left, Left, Right
 Right, Left, Left, Right Imma Piesces, she's a Taurus
 She said she expensive, well, I could afford it
 Never pay for it, but I could explore it
 Have your tongue out and legs cocked open like Jordan
 She just wanna strip and make a million right?
 So she could get rich and feed the children right?
 She ain't got no ass shots her *** real, yo
 Got her checkin in with me like I was a P.O
 I hate make-up, I hate broke hoes
 I can't talk to you bitch I ain't social
 Where the bad bitches at? Let me know though
 I can send this dick your way baby postal!
 Is it Brittany? or Myisha?
 Where the ghetto bitches at? Queesha and Syida?
 She dancin' for them dollas cus she don't know no betta
 She from the hood so she know how to throw it back betta Girl you know you look fine when you stare like that
 You know I bought you that Chanel right?
 You know I *** you like I'm fresh outta of jail right?
 And if you cheated on me I won't care right?
