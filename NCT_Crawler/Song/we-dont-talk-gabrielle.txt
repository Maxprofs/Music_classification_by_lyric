                        We don't talk like we used to do before
 Many things have changed, we're both not the same, no
 Empty nights, you're never by my side
 I waited so long, how can I carry on? I misunderstood, don't know how I could
 You were giving signs, I guess I didn't read them right
 Said you needed change, had to go away
 Guess, I should have known, that I'd be all alone 'Cos we don't talk like we used to, baby
 'Cos we don't talk like we used to, baby No conversation, no communication
 Can't remember the time when your time was mine
 Seems so long ago that we used to hold
 Time has come to pass, you see I've woken at last I misunderstood, don't see how I could
 You were giving signs, I guess, I didn't read them right
 Said you needed change, had to go away
 Guess, I should have known, that I'd be all alone Should have seen that things weren't right
 We could never meet, see eye to eye
 We're not talking anymore, so there'll never be a chance
 For us to fight anymore 'Cos we don't talk like we used to, baby
 'Cos we don't talk like we used to, baby Should have seen that things weren't right
 We should never meet, see eye to eye
 We're not talking anymore, so there'll never be a chance
 For us to fight anymore
