Like A Rolling Stone
Bob Dylan
Once upon a time you dressed so fine
Threw bums a dime in your prime,
didn't you?
People called said beware doll, you're bound to fall
You thought they were all kidding you
You used to laugh about
People who were hanging out
Now you don't talk so loud
Now you don't seem so proud
About having to be scrounging your next meal
How does it feel, how does it feel?
To be on your own, without a home
Like a complete unknown, like a rolling stone

You've gone to the finest schools, alright miss lonely
but you know you only used to get juiced in it
Nobody's ever taught you how to live out on the street
And now you're gonna have to get used to it
You say you never compromise
With the mystery tramp, but now you realize
He's not selling any alibies
As you stare into the vacuum of his eyes
And say do you want to make a deal?

(Chorus)

Oh, you never turned around to see the frowns
On the jumpers and the clowns when they did their tricks for you
You never understood that it ain't no good
You shouldn't let other people get your kicks for you
You used to ride on your chrome horse with your diplomat
Who carried on his shoulder a siamese cat
Ain't it hard when you discovered that
He really wasn't where it's at
After he took from you everything he could steal

Princess on a steeple and all the pretty people
They're all drinking, thinking that they've got it made
Exchanging all precious gifts
You better take your diamond ring, you better pawn it babe
You used to be so amused
At Napoleon in rags and the language that he used
Go to him he calls you, you can't refuse
When you ain't got nothing, you got nothing to loose
You're invisible now, you've got not secret to conceal
                        
                    |
