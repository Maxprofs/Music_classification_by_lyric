                        24 Hours - Sunmi

24 hours are not enough
When I’m with you, when I lock eyes with you
24 hours are not enough
When I’m touching you and when you’re touching me
24 hours (uh uh) 24 hours (baby baby)
24 hours (uh uh) 24 hours (baby baby)

Time goes so fast
A day with you feels like 1 minute, I’m going crazy
(It’s a pity, it’s a pity)
When I go to you, I run
When I have to go, my feet won’t go, they won’t leave
(It’s a pity, it’s a pity)


When I’m looking at you, I forget everything
You fill me up all the way
When I’m holding you, everything is perfect
I want to stay like this forever

24 hours are not enough
When I’m with you, when I lock eyes with you
24 hours are not enough
When I’m touching you and when you’re touching me
24 hours (uh uh) 24 hours (baby baby)
24 hours (uh uh) 24 hours (baby baby)

When our hands touch, electricity spreads all over my body
I close my eyes, what do I do?
(Going crazy, going crazy)
The more I drink, the thirstier I get
The more I taste, the more my body seeks
I’m falling into you
(Going crazy, going crazy)

I’ve never felt like this before
So falling endlessly is so scary
But if it’s you,if you will catch me
I’m not afraid, I want to keep going
24 hours, 24 hours, 24 hours, 24 hours

24 hours are not enough
When I’m with you, when I lock eyes with you
24 hours are not enough
When I’m touching you and when you’re touching me
24 hours (uh uh) 24 hours (baby baby)
24 hours (uh uh) 24 hours (baby baby)
