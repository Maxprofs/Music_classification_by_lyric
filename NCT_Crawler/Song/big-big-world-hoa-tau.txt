                        Bài hát: Big Big World - Hòa Tấu

I'm a big big girl 
In a big big world 
It's not a big big thing if you leave me 
But i do do feel that 
I do do will miss you much 
Miss you much... 

I can see the first leaf falling 
It's all yellow and nice 
It's so very cold outside 
Like the way i'm feeling inside 

I'm a big big girl 
In a big big world 
It's not a big big thing if you leave me 
But i do do feel that 
I do do will miss you much 
Miss you much... 

Outside it's now raining 
And tears are falling from my eyes 
Why did it have to happen 
Why did it all have to end 

I'm a big big girl 
In a big big world 
It's not a big big thing if you leave me 
But i do do feel that 
I do do will miss you much 
Miss you much... 

I have your arms around me warm like fire 
But when i open my eyes 
You're gone... 

I'm a big big girl 
In a big big world 
It's not a big big thing if you leave me 
But i do do feel that 
I do do will miss you much 
Miss you much... 

I'm a big big girl 
In a big big world 
It's not a big big thing if you leave me 
But i do feel i will miss you much 
Miss you much...
