                        Bài hát: Ornn - League Of Legends

Dark smoke exhales, from the mountain half
And wind blows through hollow dells
Skies clear as day, shall soon turn gray
And you'll know, you're nearing Ornn

Barring your path is a chasm wide
Howls rise from fathomless pits
But close stands a bridge, frozen by time
And across, you'll soon find Ornn

River of fire, that scorches the earth
Belies his kingdom of stone
And steel sing its tone, as a god stand alone
The Shaping Hand, we know as Ornn

Sparkless leap and fly from the star-fallen ore
Forging his works, diving
Bellows erupt with unbridled force
No longest lost-The Mountainsmith Ornn
                        
                    |
