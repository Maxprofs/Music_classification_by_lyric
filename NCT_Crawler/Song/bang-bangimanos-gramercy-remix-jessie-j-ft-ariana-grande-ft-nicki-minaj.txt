                        Song: Bang Bang(Imanos & Gramercy Remix) 
Singer:Jessie J, Ariana Grande, Nicki Minaj

She got a body like an hourglass
But I can give it to you all the time
She got a booty like a Cadillac
But I can send you into overdrive (oh)
(Stop and wait, wait for that
Stop, hold up, swing your bat)
See anybody could be bad to you
You need a good girl to blow your mind, yeah

Bang bang into the room (I know you want it)
Bang bang all over you (I'll let you have it)
Wait a minute let me take you there (ah)
Wait a minute tell you (ah)
Bang bang there goes your heart (I know you want it)
Back, back seat of my car (I'll let you have it)
Wait a minute let me take you there (ah)
Wait a minute tell you

Bang, bang (ah)
Bang, bang
Bang, bang (ah)


[Ariana Grande]
She might've let you hold her hand in school
But I'mma show you how to graduate
No, I don't need to hear you talk the talk
Just come and show me what your momma gave (OOh yeah)
(Your love gotta be baby, love but don't say a thing)
See anybody could be good to you
You need a bad girl to blow your mind

Bang bang into the room (I know you want it)
Bang bang all over you (I'll let you have it)
Wait a minute let me take you there (ah)
Wait a minute tell you (ah)
Bang bang there goes your heart (I know you want it)
Back, back seat of my car (I'll let you have it)
Wait a minute let me take you there (ah)
Wait a minute tell you (ah)

[Nicki Minaj]
It's Myx Moscato
It's frizz in a bottle
It's Nicki full throttle
It's oh, oh
Swimming in the grotto
We winning in the lotto
We dipping in the pot of blue foam
Kitten so good
It's dripping on wood
Get a ride in the engine that could
Go, Batman robbin' it
Bang, bang, cockin' it
Queen Nicki dominant, prominent
It's me, Jessie, and Ari
If they test me they sorry
Riders look like a Harley
Then pull off in this Ferrari
If he hanging we banging
Phone ranging, he slanging
It ain't karaoke night but get the mic
'Cause he singing

B to the A to the N to the G to the uh
B to the A to the N to the G to the hey

See anybody could be good to you
You need a bad girl to blow your mind

Bang, bang
Bang, bang (ah)
Bang, bang
Bang, bang (ah)
Bang, bang
Bang, bang (ah)
