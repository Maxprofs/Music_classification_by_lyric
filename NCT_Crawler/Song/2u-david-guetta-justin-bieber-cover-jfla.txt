                        Bài hát: 2U (David Guetta & Justin Bieber Cover) - J.Fla

[Verse 1] 
No limit in the sky 
That I won't fly for ya 
No amount of tears in my eyes 
That I won't cry for ya 
With every breath that I take 
I want you to share that air with me 
There's no promise that I won't keep 
I'll climb a mountain, there's none too steep 

[Chorus] 
When it comes to you 
There's no crime 
Let's take both of our souls 
And intertwine 
When it comes to you 
Don't be blind 
Watch me speak from my heart 
When it comes to you, comes to you 

[Verse 2] 
Cupid in a line 
Arrow got your name on it, oh yeah 
Don't miss out on a love 
And regret yourself on it, oh 
Open up your mind, clear your head 
Ain't gotta wake up to an empty bed 
Share my life, it's yours to keep 
Now that I give to you all of me, oh 

[Chorus] 
When it comes to you 
There's no crime 
Let's take both of our souls 
And intertwine 
When it comes to you 
Don't be blind 
Watch me speak from my heart 
When it comes to you, comes to you
                        
                    |
