                        Don't worry darling
 That's not forever in my eyes
 Just want to hold you for a while
 Nobody knows how it will go
 Spending this night together I can hardly believe it's true
 I can hardly believe it's you
 A celebration Turn it on and let it fly away
 And let's see what we can do
 Oh little darling it's really something
 When it's me and when it's you I'm going to give you everything I have
 Until the night is through
 Did you ever believe in love?
 Did you ever believe in love? I've got a feeling
 I've got a feeling in my heart
 We'd be together from the start
 Something inside you just cannot hide
 Is waiting the time to show it I can hardly believe it's true
 I can hardly believe it's you
 A celebration Turn it on and let it fly away
 And let's see what we can do
 Oh little darling ain't you something
 When it's me and when it's you I'm going to give you everything I have
 Until this night is through
 Did you ever believe in love?
 Did you ever believe in love?
 Well this is it Something inside you just cannot hide
 Is waiting the time to show it And I can hardly believe it's true
 I can hardly believe it's you
 A celebration
 And this is it
                        
                    |
