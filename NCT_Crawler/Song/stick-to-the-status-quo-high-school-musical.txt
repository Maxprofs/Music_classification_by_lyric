                        Bài hát: Stick To The Status Quo - High School Musical

Zeke: 

You can bet
There's nothin' but net
When I am in a zone and on a roll
But I've got a confession
My own secret obsession
And it's making me lose control 

Jocks: 

Everybody gather 'round 

Zeke (spoken): 

Well if Troy can tell his secret than I can tell mine...I bake 

Jock (spoken): 

What? 

Zeke (spoken): 

I love to bake! Strudels, scones, even apple pandowdy 

Jocks: 

Not another sound 

Zeke (spoken): 

Someday I hope to make the perfect creme brulee 

Jocks: 

No, no, no, nooooooooooo
No, no, no
Stick to the stuff you know
If you wanna be cool
Follow one simple rule
Don't mess with the flow, no no
Stick to the status quo 

Martha 

Look at me
And what do you see
Intelligence beyond compare
But inside I am stirring
Something strange is occuring
It's a secret I need to share 

Brainiacs: 

Open up, dig way down deep 

Martha Cox (spoken): 

Hip hop is my passion! I love to pop and lock and jam and break! 

Braniac (spoken): 

Is that even legal? 

Brainiacs: 

Not another peep 

Martha (spoken): 

It's just dancing. Sometimes I think it's cooler than homework. 

Brainiacs: 

No, no, no, noooooooooo
No, no, no
Stick to the stuff you know
It is better by far
To keep things as they are
Don't mess with the flow, no no
Stick to the status quo 

Skaterdude: 

Listen well
I'm ready to tell
About a need that I cannot deny
Dude, there's no explanation
For this awesome sensation
But I'm ready to let it fly 

Dudes & Dudettes: 

Speak your mind and you'll be heard 

Skaterdude (spoken): 

Alright, if Troy wants to be a singer... then i'm coming clean! I play the cello! 

Dude 1(spoken): 

Awesome! What is it? A song! 

Skaterdude (spoken): 

No, dude, it's like a giant violin! 

Dudes & Dudettes: 

Not another word 

Dude 2 (spoken): 

Do you have to wear a costume? 

Skaterdude (spoken): 

Coat and tie 

Dudes & Dudettes: 

No, no, no, nooooooooooo
No, no, no
Stick to the stuff you know
If you wanna be cool
Follow one simple rule
Don't mess with the flow, no no
Stick to the status quoooooooo 

Jocks, Brainiacs, & Dudes: 

No, no, no
Stick to the stuff you know
It is better by far
To keep things as they are
Don't mess with the flow, no no
Stick to the status quo 

Sharpay: 

This is not what I want
This is not what I planned
And I just gotta say
I do not understand
Someting is really 

Ryan: 

Something's not right 

Sharpay: 

Really wrong 

Sharpay & Ryan: 

And we gotta get things
Back where they belong
We can do it 

Skaterdude: 

Gotta play 

Dudes & Dudettes: 

Stick with what you know 

Sharpay & Ryan: 

We can do it 

Martha 

Hip hop hooray 

Brainiacs: 

She has got to go 

Sharpay & Ryan: 

We can do it 

Zeke: 

Creme Brule 

Jocks: 

Keep your voice down low 

Jocks, Brainiacs & Dudes/Dudettes: 

Not another peep
No, not another word
No, not another sound
No 

Sharpay: 

Everybody quiet 

Gabriella (spoken): 

Why is everybody staring at you? 

Taylor (spoken):

Not me, you. 

Gabriella (spoken): 

Because of the callbacks? I can't have people staring at me! I really can't! 

Jocks, Brainiacs...: 

Noooooooooooooo, no, no, no
Stick to the stuff you know
If you want to be cool
Follow one simple rule
Don't mess with the flow, oh no
Stick to the status quooooooooooooo
No, no, no
Stick to the stuff you know
It is better by far
To keep things as they are
Don't mess with the flow, no no
Stick to the status
Stick to the status
Stick to the status quo
