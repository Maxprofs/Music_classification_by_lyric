                        Bài hát: Cheri Cheri Lady - Hòa Tấu

Oh, I cannot explain
Every time it's the same
More I feel that it's real
Take my heart
I've been lonely too long
How I can't be so strong
Take the chance for romamce, take my heart
I need you so....
There's no time
I'll ever go.....

Cheri, cheri lady
Going through emotion
Love is where you find it
Listen to your heart

Cheri, cheri lady
Living in devotion
So it's always like the first time
Let me take a part
                        
                    |
