                        Bài hát: Without You - Avicii, Sandro Cavazza

You said that we would always be
Without you I feel lost at sea
Through the darkness you'd hide with me
Like the wind we'd be wild and free

[Bridge]
You said you'd follow me anywhere
But your eyes tell me you won't be there

[Chorus]
I gotta learn how to love without you
I gotta carry my cross without you
Stuck in the middle and I'm just about to
Figure it out without you
And I'm done sittin' home without you
***, I'm goin' out without you
I'm going to tear this city down without you
I'm going Bonnie and Clyde without you

[Verse 2]
Now I'm running away, my dear
From myself and the truth I fear
My heart is beatin' I can't see clear
How I'm wishing that you were here

[Bridge]
You said you'd follow me anywhere
But your eyes tell me you won't be there

[Chorus]
I gotta learn how to love without you
I gotta carry my cross without you
Stuck in the middle and I'm just about to
Figure it out without you
And I'm done sittin' home without you
***, I'm goin' out without you
I'm going to tear this city down without you
I'm going Bonnie and Clyde without you
                        
                    |
