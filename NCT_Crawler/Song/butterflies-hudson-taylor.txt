                        Just a touch on the shoulder I'm passing out
 Wish I could of told her I'm freaking out
 For I have been poisoned by butterflies
 I have been stared blankly by those eyes

 Ooohhh ooohhh
 What don't kill only makes us stronger, well I guess I'm stronger now
 What don't kill only makes us stronger, well I guess I'm stronger now

 Just a weep in the willow I'm terrified
 My head on a pillow of pesticides
 For I have been killing those butterflies
 Is that what I'm willing to Sacrifice, to sacrifice, to sacrifice

 Ooohhh ooohhh
 What don't kill only makes us stronger, well I guess I'm stronger now
 Ooohhh ooohhh
 What don't kill only makes us stronger, well I guess I'm stronger now
 What don't kill only makes us stronger, well I guess I'm stronger

 Nowww
 Roll with whatever flows or comes my way I always say
 Roll with whatever flows or comes my way I always say
 Roll with whatever flows or comes my way I always say
 Roll with whatever flows or comes my way I always say

 Ooohhh ooohhh
 What don't kill only makes us stronger, well I guess I'm stronger now
 Ooohhh ooohhh
 What don't kill only makes us stronger, well I guess I'm stronger now
 What don't kill only makes us stronger, well I guess I'm stronger now

 Roll with what ever flows or comes my way I always say
