                        I feel so nice just when you're here
 The reason why is not so clear
 I knew the first time when you told me
 I'd fall in love just as you'd hold me And now I want to stay at your side tonight
 I want to watch you as the sun lights up your eyes
 I want to know when you wake first thing you see is me
 You're all the things I prayed that I'd meet Ride, ride this wave of mine
 There're brighter things out on the other side
 Ride, ride this wave of mine
 I know that things are going to be alright Moments they come and then they go
 You'll feel so high and then before you know
 I could of sworn our future was set in stone
 But I guess some things it's just as well for God to know So now I concentrate on turning wrong to right
 I'm going to let go things I held inside so tight
 I'm going to live and let forgive things said in spite
 Clear out the smoke and usher in the light Ride, ride this wave of mine
 There're brighter things out on the other side
 Ride, ride this wave of mine
 I know that things are going to be alright
