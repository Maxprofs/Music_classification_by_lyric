                        Living and dying, laughing and crying
 Once you have seen it, you will never be the same
 Life in the fast lane is just how it seems
 Hard and it's heavy, it's dirty and mean Motorbreath, it's how I live my life
 I can't take it any other way
 Motorbreath, the sign of living fast
 It is going to take your breath away Don't stop for nothin', it's full speed or nothin'
 I am takin' down, you know, whatever's in my way
 Gettin' your kicks as you're shooting the line
 Sending the shivers up and down my spine Motorbreath, it's how I live my life
 I can't take it any other way
 Motorbreath, the sign of living fast
 It is going to take your breath away Those people who tell you not to take chances
 They are all missing on what life's about
 You only live once so take hold of the chance
 Don't end up like others, the same song and dance Motorbreath, it's how I live my life
 I can't take it any other way
 Motorbreath, the sign of living fast
 It is going to take your breath away
