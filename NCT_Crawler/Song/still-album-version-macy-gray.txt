                        In my last years with him there were bruises on my face
 In my dawn and new day, I finally got away
 But my head's all messed up and he knows just what to say
 No more dawn and new days, I'm going back to stay
 So why say bye, bye when it only makes me cry?
 I still light up like a candle burnin' when he calls me up
 I still melt down like a candle burning everytime we touch
 Oh say what you will, he does me wrong and I should be gone
 But I still be lovin' you baby and it's much too much

 We are going down, cuz you're always getting high
 And your crumbs of lovin' no longer get me by
 Wow! It gets better everytime that we get high
 Then your crumbs of lovin', they somehow get me by
 Why say bye, bye when it only makes me cry?
 I still light up like a candle burnin' when he calls me up
 I still melt down like a candle burning everytime we touch
 I still light up like a candle burnin' when he calls me up
 I still melt down like a candle burning everytime we touch
 Oh say what you will, he does me wrong and I should be gone
 I be lovin' you baby and it's much too much

 Can't I got my severed way?
 Some rain for my sunny day
 Not even one reason to stay
 Why? I said, I should've left you and
 Why? Well, I can't forgetcha baby
 Why? Ever since I metcha it's...
 Why?... Still

 I still light up like a candle burnin' (I still) when he calls me up
 Melt down like a candle burning (Why?) everytime we touch (Why?)
 I, light (Still) up like a candle burnin' when he calls me up
 I still melt down like a candle burning everytime we touch
 Oh say what you will, he does me wrong and I should be gone
 I still be lovin' you baby and it's much too much
