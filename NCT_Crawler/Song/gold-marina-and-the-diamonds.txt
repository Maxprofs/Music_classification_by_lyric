                        Bài hát: Gold - Marina and the Diamonds

You’ve got it in the palm of your hands
It’s slipping through your fingers like sand
Cause they don’t understand who you are
Does’t matter long as I am your star, star

Yeah I know that I need the gold
But what I love can’t be bought or sold

Don’t think I want what I used to want
Don’t think I need what I used to need
Don’t think I want what I used to want
Don’t think I see what I used to see

I’ve been waiting, waiting for the penny to drop
I’ve been working, working to get back what I lost
But whatever happens I’ll be okay
Cause fortune’s running out of my veins

I’m coming for you like a Greek gold rush
Cause girls they wanna, they just wanna have fund$

Don’t think I want what I used to want
Don’t think I need what I used to need
Don’t think I want what I used to want
Don’t think I see what I used to see
In El Dorado your gold
To Colorado can’t be bought or sold

Now there’s no moral to this story
But I can hear my freedom calling me, calling me

I don’t care that everybody knows
I’m a million dollars in the hole
I don’t care that everybody knows
Baby I don’t even want your gold
From El Dorado, your gold
To Colorado can’t be bought or sold
Gold Rush
Gold Rush
Free, I am free
