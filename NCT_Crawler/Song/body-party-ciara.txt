                        Bài hát: Body Party - Ciara

My body is your party, baby
Nobody's invited but you baby
I can do it slow now, tell me what you want
Baby put your phone down, you should turn it off
Cause tonight is going down, tell your boys is going down
We in the zone now, don't stop

You can keep your hands on me, touch me right there, ride my body
I cant keep my hands off you, your body, is my party
Im doing this little dance for you
You got me so excited
Now it's just me on you
Your body's my party, let's get it started

Boy you should know that your love is always on my mind
Im not gonna fight it, I want it all the time
Boy you should know that your love is always on my mind
I cant it deny it, I want you, I want you

I cant lie, I wont lie, its amazing
My faces, the places, you're taking me

Baby take your time now, theres no need to rush
We can go another round, if thats what you want
Cause tonight is going down, yeah you know its going down
We in the zone now, don't stop

You can keep your hands on me, touch me right there, ride my body
I cant keep my hands off you, your body, is my party
Im doing this little dance for you
You got me so excited
Now it's just me on you
Your body's my party, let's get it started

Boy you should know that your love is always on my mind
Im not gonna fight it, I want it all the time
Boy you should know that your love is always on my mind
I cant it deny it, I want you, I want you

The things I wanna do to you
My body's calling you
Im having so much with you
Now it's just me on you
Your body's my party, let's get it started
