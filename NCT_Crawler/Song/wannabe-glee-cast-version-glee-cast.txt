Yo, I'll tell you what I want, What I really really want
So tell me what you want, What you really really want

If you want my future
Forget my past
If you wanna get with me
Better make it fast
Now don't go wasting
My precious time
Get your act together, We could be just fine

I'll tell you what I want, What I really really want

If you wanna be my lover
You gotta get with my friends (Unique: Gotta get with my friends)
Make it last forever
Friendship never ends
If you wanna be my lover
You have got to give
Taking is too easy
But that's the way it is

Oh, whatcha you think about that
Now you know how I feel
Say you can handle my love
Are you for real? (New Directions Girls: Are you real?)
I won't be hasty
I'll give you a try
If you really bug me
Then I'll say goodbye

Yo, I'll tell you what I want, What I really really want
So tell me what you want, What you really really want
I wanna, I wanna, I wanna, I wanna
I wanna really, really, really wanna zigazig ah

If you wanna be my lover
You gotta get with my friends (Unique: Gotta get with my friends)
Make it last forever
Friendship never ends
If you wanna be my lover
You have got to give (Unique: You've got to give)
Taking is too easy
But that's the way it is

So here's a story from A to Z
You wanna get with me
You gotta listen carefully
We got Em in the place who likes it in your face
You got G like MC who likes it on an easy V doesn't come for free
She's a real lady
And as for me, haha, you'll see

Slam your body down and wind it all around
Slam your body down and wind it all around

If you wanna be my lover
You gotta get with my friends (Unique: Gotta get with my friends)
Make it last forever
Friendship never ends
If you wanna be my lover

Taking is too easy
But that's the way it is
If you wanna be my lover
You gotta, you gotta, you gotta, you gotta
You gotta slam!
Make it last forever (Oh!)
Slam your body down and wind it all around
Slam your body down and wind it all around (Uh, uh, uh, uh)
Slam your body down and wind it all around
Slam your body down and zigazig ah
