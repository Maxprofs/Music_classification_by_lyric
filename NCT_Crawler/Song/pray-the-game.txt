                        [Verse 1: Game]
 She on tights with the leather skin
 She a rockstar, bring the heavy metal in
 Girl shake like a cold bottle Medi and
 And love with it till she wouldn't let the devil in
 She pop pills like medicine
 She probably gon die, startin to be evident
 Told her slow down, girl you're heaven-sent
 I'm a thug but I got a heart like Kevin nem
 And I can't let this girl throw her life away
 Kick the door in the room and told her to put the knife away
 Took her to the hospital like right away
 She a angel with demons, the girl like nine-day
 Stressed out, parents getting divorced
 Girl I'm bout it, she ain't tryna see me caught
 She a square so it's hard to see the angle
 And that's why God gave her an guardian angel and that's me
 And I'm here for her, swear to God that I'm here for her
 Last nigga that got caught up in the airport
 She ain't had a process, she went away and did a year for him
 She a ride-and-die, like Eve and them
 Make home-cooked meals every evening
 Start stripping on the side, now I'm tipping on the side
 Love-life like...
 Am I wrong for being the best
