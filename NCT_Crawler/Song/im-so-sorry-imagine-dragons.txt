                        about time for anyone telling you off for all
 your deeds
 no sign the roaring thunder stopped in cold
 to read
 no time
 get mine and make no excuses waste of
 precious breath
 no time
 the sun shines on everyone, everyone
 love yourself to death so you gotta fire up, you gotta let go
 you'll never be loved till you've made your own
 you gotta face up, you gotta get yours
 you never know the top till you get too low a son of a stepfather
 a son of a
 I'm so sorry
 a son of a stepfather
 a son of a
 I'm so sorry no lies and no deceiving, man is what he loves
 I keep tryin' to conceive that death is from above
 no time
 get mine and make no excuses waste of
 precious breath
 no time
 the sun shines on everyone, everyone
 love yourself to death so you gotta fire up, you gotta let go
 you'll never be loved till you've made your own
 you gotta face up, you gotta get yours
 you never know the top till you get too low [repeat chorus] life isn't always what you think it'd be
 turn your head for one second and the tables turn
 and I know, I know that I did you wrong
 but will you trust me when I say that I'll
 make it up to you somehow, somehow so you gotta fire up, you gotta let go
 you'll never be loved till you've made your own
 you gotta face up, you gotta get yours
 you never know the top till you get too low [repeat chorus] I'm so sorry (x3)
