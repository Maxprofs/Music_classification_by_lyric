                        Do you ever feel like breaking down?
Do you ever feel out of place?
Like somehow you just don't belong and no one understands you
Do you ever wanna run away?
Do you lock yourself in your room 
with the radio on turned up so loud so that no one hears you screaming

no you don't know what its like when nothing feels alright
no you don't know what its like to be like me to be hurt to
to feel lost to be left out in the dark 
to be kicked when you're down
you feel like you've been pushed around to be
on the edge of breaking down and no one's there 
to save you no you don't know what its like
welcome to my life

Do you wanna be somebody else?
are you sick of feeling so left out?
are you desperate to find something more before your life is over?
Are you stuck inside a world you hate?
Are you sick of everyone around? 
with the big fake smiles and stupid lies
While deep inside your bleeding

no you don't know what its like when nothing feels alright
no you don't know what its like me to be hurt to
to feel lost to be left out in the dark 
to be kicked when you're down
you feel like you've been pushed around to be
on the edge of breaking down and no one's there 
to save you no you don't know what its like
welcome to my life

no one ever lied straight to your face
and no one ever stabbed you in the back
You might think I'm happy but I'm not gonna be ok
everybody always gave you what you wanted
never had to work it was always there

you don't know what its like, what its like
to be hurt to feel lost to be left out in the dark
to be kicked when your down you feel like you've been pushed around
to be on the edge of breaking down and no one's there to save you
no you don't know what its like

to be hurt to be lost to be left out in the dark
to be kicked when you're down you feel like you've been pushed around
to be on the edge of breaking down and no one's there to save you
no you don't know what its like welcome to my life.

welcome to my life welcome to my life
