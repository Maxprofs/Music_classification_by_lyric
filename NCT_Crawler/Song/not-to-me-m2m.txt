                        Not To Me 
Artist: M2M

You sent me up to heaven
I was safe and loved there
Then you pushed me down the ladder
Now you just left me here
But I'm strong, can't get hurt
This must be wrong, won't sink down in the dirt
What's with me
This is not happy,this is not happy
Not to me
Not reality...
Not to me
Not to me
Maybe it was my own fault
Maybe I just tripped and fell
To blame an angel tempts me now
Baby please take me up again
Forgive me 
I didn't mean to comprehend and consider, my friend
What's with me
This is not happy,this is not happy
Not to me
Not reality...
Not to me
Not to me

But I'm strong, can't get hurt
This must be wrong, won't sink down in the dirt
What's with me
This is not happy,this is not happy
Not to me
Not reality...
Not to me
Not to me
