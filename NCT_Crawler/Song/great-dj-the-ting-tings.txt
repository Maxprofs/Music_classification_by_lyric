                        Fed up with your indigestion
 You swallow worries one by one
 Folks got high at a quarter to five
 Don't you feel you're growing up undone? Nothing but the local DJ
 He said he had some songs to play
 What went down from his fooling around
 Gave hope and a brand new day Imagine all the girls, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
 And the boys, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
 And the strings, ee, ee, ee, ee, ee, ee, ee, ee
 And the drums, the drums, the drums The drums, the drums, the drums
 The drums, the drums, the drums
 The drums, the drums, the drums, oh Nothing was the same again
 All about the where and when
 Blowing our minds in a life unkind
 You gotta love the BPM When his work was all but done
 Remembering how this begun
 We wore his love like a hand in a glove
 As the preacher plays it all night long Nothing but the girls, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
 And your boys, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
 And the strings, ee, ee, ee, ee, ee, ee, ee, ee
 And the drums, the drums, the drums The drums, the drums, the drums
 The drums, the drums, the drums
 The drums, the drums, the drums The drums, the drums, the drums
 The drums, the drums, the drums
 The drums, the drums Imagine all the girls, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
 And the boys, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
 And the strings, ee, ee, ee, ee, ee, ee, ee, ee
 And the drums, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, oh All the girls, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
 And the boys, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
 And the strings, ee, ee, ee, ee, ee, ee, ee, ee
 And the drums, the drums, the drums, the drums
