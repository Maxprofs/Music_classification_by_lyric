                        Bài hát: Something New - Axwell, Sebastian Ingrosso

I see the dawn of a new beginning
This time, this time we can't go home
I hear the streets of tomorrow calling
I go, I go where you go
'Cause we belong to something
We belong to something new

In the mist of the midnight hour
You said to me
We are, we are a different kind
Oh like we've been kissed by higher power
Saying don't wait, don't wait until it's gone
'Cause we belong to something,
We belong to something,
We belong to something new

We belong to something new

We are the ones that will be remembered,
Singing
This time, this time we can't go home
Oh like we've been kissed by higher power
Saying don't wait, don't wait until it's gone

I tell you if you need to know
Here is where my heart belongs
Silver threads among the gold
Kisses over Babylon
This is more than a heart can bare
Mercy on me
We belong to something,
We belong to something,
We belong to something new

We belong to something new

We belong to something new

We belong to something

We belong to something new
                        
                    |
