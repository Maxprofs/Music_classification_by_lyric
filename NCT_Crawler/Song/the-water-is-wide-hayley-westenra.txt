                        The water's wide, I cannot get over
 And neither have I wings to fly
 Give me a boat that'll carry two
 And both shall row, my love and I Where love is planted oh there it grows
 It grows and blossoms like a rose
 It has a sweet and pleasant smell
 No flower on earth can it excel The ship there is and she sails the sea
 She's loaded deep as deep can be
 But not so deep as the love I'm in
 I know not if I sink or swim Oh, love is gentle, love is kind
 The sweetest flower when first it's new
 But love grows old and waxes cold
 And fades away like morning dew
                        
                    |
