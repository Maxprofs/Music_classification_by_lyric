                        Song: My Love (Radio Edit) - Westlife

An empty street
An empty house
A hole inside my heart
I'm all alone and the rooms are getting smaller
I wonder how
I wonder why
I wonder where they are
The days we've had
The songs we've sang togetther (oh yeah)
And oh my love
I'm holding on forever
Reaching for a love that seems so far
So I say a little prayer
And hope my dreams will take me there
Where the skies are blue to see you once again
My love
Overseas from coast to coast
To find the place I love the most
Where the fields are green to see you once again
My love
I try to read
I go to work
I'm laughing with my friends
But I can't stop to keep myself from thingking
I wonder how
I wonder why
I wonder where they are
The days we had
The songs we sang together
And oh my love
I'm holding on forever
Reaching for the love that seems so far
So I say a little prayer
And hope my dreams will take me there
Where the skies are blue to see you once again
My love
Overseas from coast to coast
To find the place I love the most
Where the fields are green to see you once again
To hold you in my arms
To promise you my love
To tell you from my heart
What I'm thingking of
Reaching for the love that seems so far
So I say a little prayer
And hope my dreams will take me there
Where the skies are blue to see you once again
My love
Overseas from coast to coast
To find the place I love the most
Where the fields are green to see you once again
My love
So I say a little prayer
And hope my dreams will take me there
Where the skies are blue to see you once again
Overseas from coast to coast
To find the place I love the most
Where the fields are green to see you once again
My love
                        
                    |
