                        Bài hát: Where Them Girl At - David Guetta

[Chorus]

So many girls in here, where do I begin?
I seen this one, I’m bout to go in
Then she said, I’m here with my friends
She got me thinking and that's when I said

Where them girls at, girls at?
Where them girls at, girls at?
Where them girls at, girls at?
So go get them, we can all be friends

[Flo Rida - Verse 1]

Hey, bring it on baby, all your friends
You’re the *** and I love that body
You wanna ball, lets mix it, I swear you’re good, I wont tell nobody
You got a BFF, I wanna see that girl, it’s all women invited
Hair do’s and nails, that Louis, Chanel all up in the body
President’s in my wallet, no rules I’m bout it
Blow the whistle for the hotties
I got it, shawty, it’s never too much, can’t be doing too much
10 to one of me, I can handle that love
Outta of my reach, we can all get buzz
Holla cause I’m free, no matter it’s no rush

[Chorus]

So many girls in here, where do I begin?
I seen this one, I’m bout to go in
Then she said, I’m here with my friends
She got me thinking and that's when I said

Where them girls at, girls at?
Where them girls at, girls at?
Where them girls at, girls at?
So go get them, we can all be friends

[Nicki Minaj - Verse 2]

Peebe, peebe, who's people barkin'
Two years ago I renewed my license

Anyway why’d I start my verse like that
Cause I can do it, you can suck on a ballsack
No no I don’t endorse that, pause that, abort that
Just the other day mi go London, saw dat, kids down the street
Paparazzi, all dat
Hey hey what can I say?
Day day day da-day day
Coming through the club all the girls in the back of me
This aint football why the f-ck they tryna tackle me?
Really, I pick dude at the bar like really, looking like he wanna good time like really
Said he had a friend for my home girl Lilly Lilly, Lilly, Lilly

So many boys in here where do I begin
I see this one, I’m bout to in
Than he said I’m here with my friends
He got to thank us, then thats when he said

[Hook]

Where them girls at, girls at?
Where them girls at, girls at?
Where them girls at, girls at?
So go get them, we can all be friends

[Nicki Minaj]

Where my girls at uhh, hmm, uhh
Where my girls at uhh, hmm, uhh
Yo, where my girls at uhh, hmm, uhh
Yo, where my girls tryna get to jumpin’

[Chorus]

So many girls in here, where do I begin?
I seen this one, I’m bout to go in
Then she said, I’m here with my friends
She got me thinking and that's when I said

Where them girls at, girls at?
Where them girls at, girls at?
Where them girls at, girls at?
So go get them, we can all be friends
