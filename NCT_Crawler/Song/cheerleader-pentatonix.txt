                        Bài hát: Cheerleader - Pentatonix

When I need motivation
My one solution is my queen
'Cause she stay strong
She is always in my corner
Right there when I want her
All these other girls are tempting
But I'm empty when you're gone
And they say

Do you need me?
Do you think I'm pretty?
Do I make you feel like cheating?
And I'm like no, not really cause

Oh I think that I found myself a cheerleader
She is always right there when I need her

Oh I think that I found myself a cheerleader
She is always right there when I need her

(Scott)

She walks like a model
She grants my wishes like a genie in a bottle
'Cause I'm the wizard of love
And I got the magic wand
All these other girls are tempting
But I'm empty when you're gone
And they say

Do you need me?
Do you think I'm pretty?
Do I make you feel like cheating?
And I'm like no, not really cause

Oh I think that I found myself a cheerleader
She is always right there when I need her

Oh I think that I found myself a cheerleader
She is always right there when I need her

She {gives me love and affection, Baby did I mention} x7

(Mitch joins in the 3rd time)
Right there, Right there when I need her}x5

(Kirstie joins in mitch's 3rd time)
Do you need me? Tell me, tell me, tell me
Do you think I'm pretty? Tell me, tell me, tell me
Do you need me? Tell me, tell me, tell me

(Everyone)
Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh
Badam-Badam-Badam-Badam Pa-pam

Oh I think that I found myself a cheerleader
She is always right there when I need her

Oh I think that I found myself a cheerleader
She is always right there when I need her
