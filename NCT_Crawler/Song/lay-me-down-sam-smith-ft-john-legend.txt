                        Bài hát: Lay Me Down - Sam Smith, John Legend

Sam Smith:
Yes, I do, I believe
That one day I will be
Where I was right there
Right next to you

And it's hard
The days just seems so dark
The moon, the stars
Are nothing without you

Your touch, your skin
Where do I begin?
No words can explain
The way I'm missing you

Deny this emptiness
This hole that I'm inside
These tears
They tell their own story

Told me not to cry when you were gone
But the feeling's overwhelming, it's much too strong

Can I lay by your side?
Next to you, you
And make sure you're alright
I'll take care of you
I don't want to be here if I can't be with you tonight

John Legend:
I'm reaching out to you
Can you hear my call?
This hurt that I've been through
I'm missing you, missing you like crazy

Together:
Can I lay by your side?
Next to you, you
And make sure you're alright
I'll take care of you
I don't want to be here if I can't be with you tonight

John Legend:
Lay me down tonight

Sam Smith:
Lay me by your side

John Legend:
Lay me down tonight

Sam Smith:
Lay me by your side

Together:
Can I lay by your side?
Next to you
You
                        
                    |
