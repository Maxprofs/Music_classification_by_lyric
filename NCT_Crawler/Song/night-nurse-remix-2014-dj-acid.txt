                        Bài hát: Night Nurse (Remix 2014) - Dj Acid

Night Nurse, urse
Night Nurse, urse

Its critical
Your body's gonna rock like a chemical
Makes you bouncing around the block like an outlaw
We're gonna take it too the top, 12 O'Clock (that's it)
G-g-guess whos on night shift?,
'Cause tonight I'm working over time
Oh are you ready to cross the line
I'll treat you until the break of dawn
You're not alone

Night Nurse-urse
Night Nurse-urse
Who you gonna call?
Night Nurse-urse
Who you gonna call?

Don't wanna be a lover, oh no
But I could be your remedy, oh oh
Don't wanna be a lover, oh no
But I could be your remedy, your cure
Night Nurse

Its physical
Cuz tonight were gonna party on the top floor
And I'll meet you there
And I dont care if it all comes natural
Your medical prescription -- baby get ready now
This is my religion
'Cause tonight I'm working over time
Oh are you ready to cross the line
I'll treat you until the break of dawn
You're not alone

Night Nurse-urse
Night Nurse-urse
Who you gonna call?
Night Nurse-urse
Who you gonna call?

Don't wanna be a lover, oh no
But I could be your remedy, oh oh
Don't wanna be a lover, oh no
But I could be your remedy, your cure
Night Nurse

Mee-me-mee-mee-bee-bee-bee-bee
I am not the enemy I cold be your remedy
Doh-doh-doh-doh-go-doh-doh do
I am not the enemy I could be your remedy
Its critical
'Cause your bodys gonna rock just like and outlaw, outlaw
Who You Gonna Call?
Its Physical
'Cause tonight we gonna party on the top floor
Party on the top floor
Break-Break Down

Night Nurse-urse
Night Nurse-urse
Who you gonna call?
Night Nurse-urse
Who you gonna call?

Don't wanna be a lover, oh no
But I could be your remedy, oh oh
Don't wanna be a lover, oh no
But I could be your remedy, your cure
                        
                    |
