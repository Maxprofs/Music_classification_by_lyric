                        Bài hát: Attention (Rock Cover) - Nightcore

Whoa oh oh hm

You've been runnin' 'round, runnin' 'round
Runnin' 'round throwin' that dirt all on my name
'Cause you knew that I, knew that I
Knew that I'd call you up

You've been going 'round, going 'round
Going 'round every party in LA
'Cause you knew that I, knew that I 
Knew that I'd be at one, oh

I know that dress is karma, perfume regret
You got me thinking 'bout when you were mine
And now I'm all up on ya, what you expect?
But you're not coming home with me tonight

[Đk:]
You just want attention
You don't want my heart
Maybe you just hate the thought of me with someone new

Yeah, you just want attention
I knew from the start
You're just making sure I'm never gettin' over you, oh

You've been runnin' round, runnin' round
Runnin' round throwing that dirt all on my name
'Cause you knew that I, knew that I
Knew that I'd call you up

Baby, now that we're, now that we're
Now that we're right here standing face to face
You already know, 'ready know
'Ready know that you won, oh

I know that dress is karma perfume regret
You got me thinking 'bout when you were mine
And now I'm all up on ya, what you expect?
But you're not coming home with me tonight

[Đk:]
You just want attention
You don't want my heart
Maybe you just hate the thought of me with someone new, someone new

Yeah, you just want attention, oh
I knew from the start, the start
You're just making sure I'm never gettin' over you, over you, oh

What are you doin' to me?
What are you doin', huh? 
What are you doin' to me?
What are you doin', huh? 

What are you doin' to me?
What are you doin', huh?
What are you doin' to me?
What are you doin', huh?

I know that dress is karma, perfume regret
You got me thinking 'bout when you were mine
And now I'm all up on ya, what you expect?
But you're not coming home with me tonight

[Đk:]
You just want attention
You don't want my heart
Maybe you just hate the thought of me with someone new

Yeah, you just want attention
I knew from the start
You're just making sure I'm never gettin' over you, over you

What are you doin' to me? 
What are you doin', huh? 
What are you doin' to me?
What are you doin', huh?

What are you doin' to me?
What are you doin', huh?
What are you doin' to me?
What are you doin', huh?
