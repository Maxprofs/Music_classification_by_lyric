Britney Spears - Quicksand

I still see your coat hangin on the door
Never let anybody, put one there before
My pillows got your head printed it on it
Baby, of all the guys, you were my favorite (You we’re my favorite)

Don’t ask, me why (Me why)
I just can’t, say good-bye (Say good-bye)
Not not, tonight (Tonight)
No, I just can’t say it (Say it)

Cause I’m gonna hold on, yeah I’m gonna hold on
Baby, got to keep holdin’ on to what we have
Cause I don’t wanna move on, so we got to hold on
But baby, because you and me are sinkin’ like Quicksand (Like Quicksand)

(Like-like-like) Like Quicksand
(Like-like-like) Like Quicksand
(Like-like-like) But baby, because-you and me are sinkin’ like Quicksand
(Like-like-like) Like Quicksand
(Like-like-like) Baby, like Quicksand
(Like-like-like) But baby, because-you and me are sinkin’ like Quicksand

You came along, I didn’t know love (Know love)
But now I know, but sometimes its just not enough (It’s just not enough)
I hear your footsteps in my corridor, but it is just my heart
It’s pounding like before (It’s pounding like before)

Wish I, could try (Could try)
But I just can’t, say good-bye (I just can’t say good-bye)
No not, tonight (Tonight)
No I just can’t say it (I just can’t say it!)

Cause I’m gonna hold on, yeah I’m gonna hold on
Baby, got to keep holdin’ on to what we have (Gotta keep holdin’ on to what we have)
Cause I don’t wanna move on, so we got to hold on (So we gotta hold on)
But baby, because you and me are sinkin’ like Quicksand (Sinkin’ like Quicksand)

(Like-like-like) Like Quicksand
(Like-like-like) Like Quicksand
(Like-like-like) But baby, because you and me are sinkin’ like Quicksand
(Like-like-like) Like Quicksand
(Like-like-like) Baby, like Quicksand
(Like-like-like) But baby, because-you and me are sinkin’ like Quicksand

Cause the ground is breaking, I can feel it shaking
Wish it was that easy, but it’s not that easy
Gotta hold my hands out, gotta keep my head up
Gotta keep on breathin’, baby even if we’re sinkin’

Even If we’re sinkin’
Baby, even If we’re sinkin’ (Sinkin’)

Even if we are sinkin’ (Sinkin’)
Cause I just-just, gotta-gotta (I just-just, gotta-gotta!)
Hold

Cause I’m gonna hold on, yeah I’m gonna hold on
Baby, got to keep holdin’ on, to what we have
Cause I don’t wanna move on, so we got to hold on (Hold on!)
But baby, because-you and me are skin’ like Quicksand
(Gotta, gotta hold on)

We got it like we wanna, we don’t even need to be so strong
Only you and me, we need to hold on and hold on
Oh we got it like we wanna, we don’t even need to be so strong
Only you and me, we need to hold on and hold on

Hold on, and hold on
And hold on, and hold on (Baby, because-you and me are sinkin’ like Quicksand)
(Oh, oh, oh) And hold on (Hold on)
And hold on (And hold on)
And hold on (And hold on)
Baby, because you and me are sinkin’ like Quicksand (Hold on, and hold on)
And hold on (Hold on)
And hold on (And hold on)
And hold on (And hold on)
Baby, because-you and me are sinkin’ like Quicksand (Hold on, and hold on)
