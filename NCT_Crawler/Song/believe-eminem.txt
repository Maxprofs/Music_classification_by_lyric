[Verse 1]
And I started from the bottom
Like a snowman, ground up
Like round chuck, and still put hands on you
Staying wound up is how I spend time
Sucker free, confidence high
Such a breeze when I pin rhymes
I just got the air about me
Like wind chimes (yeah)
Another day in the life (uh)
Used to have to scrape to get by (yeah)
Now my community's gated
And I made it, and my neighbors say hi (say hi)
I'm giving them pounds, I'm upscale now
Guess it means I'm way in the sky
But I still remember the days of, minimal wage for
General labor, welfare recipients is a minor
Look at how government assistance has made ya
Adversity, if at first you don't succeed
Put your temper to more use 'cause being broke's a poor excuse
That *** only gives you more fuel
Show them why you're you
So close, God, it's like I almost got it
But close only counts in timebombs and horseshoes
So I uni-bomb *** (tick, tick, tick)
No remorse
Screw it, I'm lit, and that attitude I blew up on quick
That's why they call me firecracker
I grew up on wick (wick, wick, wick) with a short fuse
I got some important news to report to
Anyone who thought I was done, nah, bitch, not quite
Spotlight's back on, got my faith, where's yours?


[Chorus]
Do you still believe in me?
Didn't I get everything I had to give you to make you see?
I'll never forget if you turn your back on me
Now and walk out I will never let you live it down
(I'll never quit) Do you still believe in me?


[Verse 2]
Man, I know sometimes these thoughts can be harsh and cold as ice
To me, they’re just ink blots
I just fling 'em like slingshots, and so precise
So you might want to think it over twice
When you retards can roll the dice
But beef will at least cost you your career
'Cause even my cheap shots are overpriced
But this middle finger's free as a bird
Nuke warhead-ed birth, you just forehead on Earth
Too short for a verse, studied his formula
Learned how to incorporate a curse
Point it towards corporate America
Stick a fork in it and turn
'Cause four-letter words are more better
Heard the world force-fed a turd to me
You're getting yours
But sometimes I overdo it
But I just get so into it
I was there consoling you when no one knew it
When your situation showed no improvement
I was that door, you walked over to it
I'm the light at the end of tunnel so people are always looking at me as they're going through it
When that tunnel vision is unclear, *** becomes too much to bear
Since "Cleaning Out My Closet" when I was having trouble with the snare
I'm that unrealistic prayer answered
And I'ma get you jacked up, like you’re trying to fix a flat (uh), when you struggle with despair
That double fisted bear, knuckles coupled with this pair of nuts I'm cupping
I am your *** switch, nothing can compare

[Chorus]
Do you still believe in me?
Didn't I get everything I had to give you to make you see?
I'll never forget if you turn your back on me
Now and walk out I will never let you live it down
(I'll never quit) Do you still believe in me?

[Verse 3]
Started from the bottom like a snowman
Oh man, put that in your corncob pipe and smoke that
But my battery's low
I'm gonna need a booster in my pack
I know I always got Proof on my back
I called you Proof 'cause I knew for a fact
My ace in the hole
Homie I'm calling on you 'cause I think I'm slowly startin' to lose faith in it, so
Give me that inkling and motivation to go
Hussein with the flow
Fake fans with the two-faced that show
Let heartbeats loot, produce hate in my soul
Laying vocals two days in a row
True statement, hate to go down this road
But there's only one route to cross this bridge
So I walk in this bitch with loose change
'Cause all my dues paid
But this booth is taking its toll
But it's never too late to start a new beginning
That goes for you too
So what the *** you gon' do, use the tools you're given?
Or are you going to use the cards you were dealt as an excuse for you to not do *** with them
I used to play the loser victim
'Til I saw the way Proof was driven
I found my vehicle and I haven't ran out of gas yet
And when they stacked decks, turn handicaps into assets
Fanny packs, hourglasses
If time was on my side, I'd still have none to waste
Man, in my younger days, that dream was so much fun to chase
It's like I run in place while this *** dangled in front of my face
But how do you keep up the pace and the hunger pains once you've won the race?
When that pool exhaust is cooling off
'Cause you don't got nothing left to prove at all
'Cause you done already hit them with the coup de grâce
Still you feel the need
To go through and deal with that Bruce Willis
That blue still, that truth still
When that wheel's loose, I won't lose will
Do you still believe?
