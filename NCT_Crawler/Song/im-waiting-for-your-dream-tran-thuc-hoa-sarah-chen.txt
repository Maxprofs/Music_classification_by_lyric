                        Bài hát: I'm Waiting For Your Dream - Sarah Chen (Trần Thục Hoa)

How could someone like you be without love 
How could someone left you in tears
I will along to hold you here in my arm 
You are all that i want I will do everything I could for you 

Baby now all your dreams will come true, and then you never have to feel blue 
Cause i will always be there for you. 
I know that someone lets your heart in pain 
Someone lets you feeling lonely 
But I will be there when you need a hand 

I will be there when the sun come shining through 
I know that someone lets your heart in pain 
Someone lets you feeling lonely 
But now you have me inside your heart 
And you never be alone again
                        
                    |
