                        Bài hát: Moment By Moment - Yvonne Elliman

Though our love is like
A winding road of uncertainty
I long to trust your smile
And all the ways you feel
Touching me

Moment by moment
Our lifetime goes on
Till one day
Our somedays are gone

Look at us
Two drifters with a dream
Scared to see it through
But we're so happy now
It might be beautiful
If we do

For moment by moment
The choices we make
Depend on the chances we take

Oh, for moment
Moment by moment
Our lifetime goes on
Till one day
Our somedays are gone

For moment, moment by moment
The choices we make
Depend on the chances we take

Oh, moment, moment by moment
                        
                    |
