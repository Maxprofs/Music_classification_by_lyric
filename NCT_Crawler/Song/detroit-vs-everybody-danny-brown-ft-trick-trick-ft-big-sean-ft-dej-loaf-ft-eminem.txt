[Hook: Dej Loaf]
Tell 'em if they want it, they can come get that (static)
I swear I love my city, I just want a little (static)
See me, they salute me, they ain't ready for that (static)
Detroit vs. Everybody

[Verse: Royce Da 5'9"]
I took a bite out the rotten apple by the poison tree
All these females need to email to make noise
And I think it's changin' a lot, he *** with my authority
Then he shall see shells, but not by the seashore
If he gang bangin' or not
It's simple as the alphabet
He F with me, that G shall surely see
He definitely is 'bout it, it's retail fraud, he's weak
The honest gesture, the trigger finger 'round the diamond tester, we tail flaw with heat
The same soldier, it's me, myself and I
Ridin' 'round shootin' my biopic and my autobiography
Range Rover, this ain't the squash beef state
You thinkin' makeup, we thinkin' Lark Voorhies face
The twin Eagle's, an Aries coupe, might as well ride by in an ambulance
My parachute like skydivin' in Hammer pants
So call it siblin' rivalry
Take his life, call it the unforgivable robbery
A wise man told me that holdin' a grudge is like
Lettin' somebody just live inside of your head rent free
(Real talk) I don't got time to evict these clowns
Y'all niggas been bitches, that's none of my business, but I don't sip tea
(That's Nickel) Ride around his block
All he knows is pitfalls, that's why he's always climbin' out his drop
(I got a question) Do you wanna ride or die?
Welcome to Detroit, motha***a

[Verse 2: Big Sean]

[Hook: Dej Loaf]
[Verse 4: Eminem]
Lately it seems as if it's me against the world
Like it was before my life became a movie
And they used to use my motha***in' trailer to tease me with
But I flipped that script like AB filler
Painkillers to pop that lid off that safety seal
It made me feel amazing, made me celebrate me
And if I may reiterate, I ain't even need a script
I ain't bein' conceited
But I made it to radio, eat a dick
I still never ABC the ***
Mainstream appeal and the skill is what made me iller
Detroit Vs. Everybody lyrics on ***
Since before they called Jay Dee Dilla
I was daydreamin' one day I would be the ***
And if I ever end up escapin' the streets I swear that I would stay here
Still in it, I'm crazy, I'll always be real
Don't make me steal an 18 wheeler
Break all of my friends out of here and take 'em straight to the Mercedes dealer
Peel off back to the same block that we came from, rampage
You crazy for me to flip
What's makin' you think I need a switch? Cause I'm Adrian Peterson
When he's raging and heated and on the way to go beat his kid
On the track I spank like he just did
(DETROIT!) I can't never leave this bitch
Sick of bein' treated like me and ***
But Jesus, I can just see why people quit callin' me to do features
And them cyphers on BET cause if I wasn't me
I probably wouldn't want to play with me neither, ***
Seems to be reachin' this fever pitch
180 degrees in here trying to wait for the cedar chips
MCs just bit off more than they can chew like a face full of Swedish Fish
Or Lorena with two penises
Hateful and genius, this inconvenience
And for the record, you won't want this kind of static in your life
When I'm makin' you cling to it
They consider tryna reinsulate yah when it's maybe in for another crazy winter
It's so cold in the D, it is as days begin to tick away
But ain't this what really made me into the angry bitter blonde
Sick of bein' underdog
Don't make me unleash this ***, release this Pit
May even seem as if
I'm yankin' your chain a bit or maybe the way in which I'm sayin' ***
Is playin' with your relation, changin' it
It's still the same and Shady's still a lady killer
Since the day I went insane and attacked the baby sitter
With a potato peeler and mushed her face into the entertainment center
It's like another plane just entered into Ukraine again
The Bermuda Triangle and attempted to make a safety descent
Awaiting anyone who ain't affiliated, it could be danger
Did you make arrangements with the gangsters when you came here?
And I came to kill 'em

[Hook: Dej Loaf]
