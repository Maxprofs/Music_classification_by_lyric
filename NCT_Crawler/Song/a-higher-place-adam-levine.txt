                        Bài hát: A Higher Place - Adam Levine

Oh, Oh yeah [x4]

I don't know why I don't see the people in this town
Everyone I meet seems so uptight, wearing their frown
What good is living where dreams come true 
If nobody smiles
Everyone's chasing the latest star, the latest style

You take me to another space in time
You take me to a higher place 
So I- I'm about to get out of the race
I don't mind
You ought to know that everything's nothing If I don't have you

I don't know if I'm the fool who's getting this all wrong
That's the dream to sing, the perfect girl, the perfect song
All I know is I can't keep on wearing this disguise
When you're the only one who sees what's real in my eyes

You take me to another space in time
You take me to a higher place
So I- I'm about to get out of the race
I don't mind
You ought to know that everything's nothing If I don't have you

You take me to another place [x2]
You take me to a higher place 
Oh, yeah

You take me to another space in time
You take me to a higher place
So I- I'm about to get out of the race
I don't mind
You ought to know that everything's nothing if I don't have you

(Space, Place)
So I'm about to get out of the race
I don't mind
You ought to know that everything's nothing If I don't have you
                        
                    |
