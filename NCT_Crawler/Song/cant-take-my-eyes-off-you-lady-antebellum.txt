                        Bài hát: Cant Take My Eyes Off You - Lady Antebellum

I know that the bridges that I've burned
Along the way
Have left me with these walls and these scars
That won't go away
And opening up has always been the hardest thing
Until you came

[Chorus:]
So lay here beside me just hold me and don't let go
This feelin' I'm feelin' is somethin' I've never known
And I just can't take my eyes off you
And I just can't take my eyes off you

I love when you tell me that I'm pretty
When I just wake up
And I love how you tease me when I'm moody
But it's never too much
I'm falling fast but the truth is I'm not scared at all
You're climbin' my walls

[Chorus]

Off you
Off you

So lay here beside me just hold me and don't let go
Oh, this feelin I'm feelin is somethin' I've never known
And I just can't take my eyes off you
And I just can't take my eyes off you
                        
                    |
