Kelly Clarkson - I Do Not Hook Up

Oh, sweetheart,
put the bottle down
You've got too much talent
I see you through those bloodshot eyes
There's a cure, you've found it
Slow motion, sparks
You've caught that chill
Now don't deny it
But boys will be boys
Oh, yes, they will
They don't wanna define it
Just give up the game and get into me
If you're looking for thrills then get cold feet

Oh, no I do not hook up,
up I go slow
So if you want me,
I don't come cheap
Keep your thing in your pants,
your heart on your sleeve
Oh, no I do not hook up,
up I fall deep
Cause the more that you try,
the harder I'll fight
To say goodnight

 I can't cook no,
but I can clean
Up the mess you left
Lay your head down and feel the beat
As I kiss your forehead
This may not last but this is now
So love the one you're with
You wanna chase but you're chasin' your tail
A quick fix won't ever get you well

Oh, no I do not hook up,
up I go slow
So if you want me,
I don't come cheap
Keep your thing in your pants,
your heart on your sleeve
Oh, no I do not hook up,
up I fall deep
Cause the more that you try,
the harder I'll fight
To say

Cause I feel
The distance
Between us
Could be over
With the snap of your finger
Oh, no

Oh, no I do not hook up,
up I go slow
So if you want me,
I don't come cheap
Keep your thing in your pants,
your heart on your sleeve
Oh, no I do not hook up,
up I fall deep
Cause the more that you try,
the harder I'll fight
To say
Cause the more that you try,
the harder I'll fight
To say goodnight
Oh, sweetheart, put the bottle down
Cause I don't wanna miss out
