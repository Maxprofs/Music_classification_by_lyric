                        Bài hát: Wolves (Rusko Remix) - Selena Gomez, Marshmello 

[Verse 1] 
In your eyes, there's a heavy blue 
One to love, and one to lose 
Sweet divide, a heavy truth 
Water or wine, don't make me choose 

[Pre-Chorus] 
I wanna feel the way that we did that summer night, night 
Drunk on a feeling, alone with the stars in the sky 

[Chorus] 
I've been running through the jungle 
I've been running with the wolves 
To get to you, to get to you 
I've been down the darkest alleys 
Saw the dark side of the moon 
To get to you, to get to you 
I've looked for love in every stranger 
Took too much to ease the anger 
All for you, yeah, all for you 
I've been running through the jungle 
I've been crying with the wolves 
To get to you, to get to you, to get to you 

[Drop] 
To get to you 
To get to you 

[Pre-Chorus] 
I wanna feel the way that we did that summer night, night 
Drunk on a feeling, alone with the stars in the sky 

[Chorus] 
I've been running through the jungle 
I've been running with the wolves 
To get to you, to get to you 
I've been down the darkest alleys 
Saw the dark side of the moon 
To get to you, to get to you 
I've looked for love in every stranger 
Took too much to ease the anger 
All for you, yeah, all for you 
I've been running through the jungle 
I've been crying with the wolves 
To get to you, to get to you, to get to you 

[Drop] 
I've been running
To get to you 
To get to you 
I've been running
To get to you 
To get to you 

[Chorus] 
I've been running through the jungle 
I've been running with the wolves 
To get to you, to get to you 
I've been down the darkest alleys 
Saw the dark side of the moon 
To get to you, to get to you 
I've looked for love in every stranger 
Took too much to ease the anger 
All for you, yeah, all for you 
I've been running through the jungle 
I've been crying with the wolves 
To get to you, to get to you, to get to you

[Drop] 
I've been running
To get to you 
To get to you 
I've been running.
To get to you 
To get to you
To get to you
