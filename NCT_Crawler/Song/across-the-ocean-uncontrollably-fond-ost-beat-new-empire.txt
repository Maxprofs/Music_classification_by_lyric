                        Bài hát: Across The Ocean (Uncontrollably Fond OST) Beat - New Empire

We could sail across the seven seas 
Take you far away from the mysteries that reminds you 
Of the loneliness in you heart 
We could search for islands far and near 
Join in creation look to hear 
All the songs they've been singing all these years 

Search across the oceans 
For who you are been lost for too long 
Searching for a secret 
In coming home we find we have what we need 

If my boat were ever to drift ashore would you 
Come find me your ropes and oars are a beacon 
That's hidden deep within my soul 
So I'll bury my treasure and bury it deep 
With all of my footprints I've hidden the keys 
You can find them at the bottom of this sea 

Search across the oceans 
For who you are been lost for too long 
Searching for a secret 
In coming home we find we have

Search across the oceans 
For who you are been lost for too long 
Searching for a secret 
In coming home we find 

So why are we always going to waste 
Pull me together and put me in place 
[x2] 

Search across the oceans 
For who you are been lost for too long 
In coming home we find 
Search across the oceans 
For who you are been lost for too long 
Searching for a secret 
In coming home we find we have all we need 

In coming home we find we have all we need 
In coming home you'll find we have all you need
                        
                    |
