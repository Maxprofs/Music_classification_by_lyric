                        Bài hát : History Maker (Yuri!!! On Ice Opening) - Dean Fujioka (Đằng Cương Điện)

Can you hear my heartbeat?
Tired of feeling never enough
I close my eyes and tell myself that my dreams will come true

There'll be no more darkness 
when you believe in yourself you are unstoppable
Where your destiny lies, dancing on the blades, you set my heart on fire

Don't stop us now, the moment of truth
We were born to make history 
We'll make it happen, we'll turn it around
Yes, we were born to make history


Can you hear my heartbeat?
I've got a feeling it's never too late
I close my eyes and see myself how my dreams will come true
There'll be no more darkness 
when you believe in yourself you are unstoppable
Where your destiny lies, dancing on the blades, you set my heart on fire

Don't stop us now, the moment of truth
We were born to make history 
We'll make it happen, we'll turn it around
Yes, we were born to make history
                        
                    |
