                        Bend me, shape me, misdirect me, it's all the same to me
 Look at all this useless talk, look at all this useless talk
 Look at all this useless talk upon the cross You look at me but you don't see
 Understand I'm a sinner, don't corner me
 Don't lecture me, raise your hands, you're a sinner Is this everything you wanted, find another dream
 You never hear a word I say, you never hear a word I say
 You never hear a word I say, so pray You look at me but you don't see
 Understand I'm a sinner, don't corner me
 Don't lecture me, raise your hands, you're a sinner I'm a sinner, look at all these people in front of me
 Look at all these people in front of me
 Look at all these people in front of me
 Look at all these people in front of me, now You look at me but you don't see
 Understand I'm a sinner, don't corner me
 Don't lecture me, raise your hands, you're a sinner
