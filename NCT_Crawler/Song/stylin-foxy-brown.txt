 [Baby]
 Boss, I see you there!
 I see you Mike! I see you Roy!
 Keep your hands up nigga keep fightin
 [Baby]
 Mami, boss nigga, boss bitch
 Boss whips with boss chips
 Drive Escalade on boss blades
 Sitten on them twenty-tre's
 and thats on some stop and go's
 When I pull up the car stop the rims still flow's
 Picture me rollin like this
 Burberry, Gucci, interior so slick
 Me and Foxy with the matchip whips
 That Benz, that Bently, Lambourgini luxury ***
 I red carpet my bitch
 Bought her up to Jacob and laced my bitch
 I bought a 99 Hummer
 *** that I got 99 bundles
 Nigga life is a hustle
 *** that little daddy, life is a struggle!
 [Foxy]
 Its necessary we styles in Burburry
 And our walk is mean in them Frankie B. jeans boy
 Its necessary we stays in Burburry
 And a Mark Jacob bag and a H-Tod shoe (Whoo)
 [Noreaga]
 Its necessary we smoke the blueberry
 and we pop that Louie thirteen with our team boy
 Its necessary we rock the Sean John
 With a nice throwback and some Air Force Ones
 [Noreaga]
 See, all that ain't nothin we at the bar frontin
 Its necessary I smokes that blueberry
 When I do white liquor I do it with cranberry
 Niggas fall off top and look at they fans worried
 But uhh, see I don't care bout nothin no more
 I used to act like I like you, I ain't frontin no more
 We used to lay up in the park, Dump buckets of raw
 Now I hope you die slow, plus a nigga thats poor
 See snakes I can't deal with
 Fools they can't build with
 Stupid, get shot in the foot and get and then killed in
 But still niggas doubt my name
 I move slow like Ozzy Osbourne with a cane
 Ghetto tabernacle, and s
