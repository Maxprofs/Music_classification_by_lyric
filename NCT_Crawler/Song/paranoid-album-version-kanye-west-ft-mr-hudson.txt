808's & Heartbreak

Why are you so paranoid?
Don't be so paranoid.
Don't be so

Baby don't worry bout it
Hey there don't even think about it
You worry bout the wrong things, the wrong things

Tell me right now,you really wanna spend your whole life alone?
A little time out might do you good, might do us good.
'Fore we be done for good.
Cuz i can make it good i can make it hood
I can make you come i can make you go
I can make it high i can make it fly
Make you touch the sky
Hey maybe so.

All the time you be up in my
Checking through my cellphone
Baby no
You wanna kill the vibe on another night?
Here's another fight
Oh here we go

Baby don't worry bout it
Lady we'll go out to the floor

Anyway they don't know you like I do (They don't know)
They'll never know you (Never Know)
Anyway they don't know you like I do (Never Know)

All of the time you wanna complain about the nights alone
So now you're here with me
Show some gratitude
Leave the attitude way back at home
Yeah you see em look
Baby let em look
Give you cold looks cuz we look cold
Yeah you heard about all the word of mouth
Don't worry about what we can't control
All the talk in the world lost in the world
'Til you finally let that thing go
You wanna check into the heartbreak hotel
But sorry we're closed.

Lady don't worry bout it
Baby we'll go out to the floor

Anyway they don't know you like I do (to they floor)
They'll never know you (Hey! never know)
Anyway they don't know you like I do (They don't know)

Baby don't worry bout it
Lady don't even think about it
You worry bout the wrong things, the wrong things
You worry bout the wrong thing

Anyway they don't know you like I do
They'll never know you
Anyway they don't know you like I do
They'll never know you.
