                        Let me know, let me know
 Let me know, let me know
 Let me know When I feel, what I feel
 Sometimes it's hard to tell you so
 You may not be in the mood to learn
 What you think you know There are times when I find
 You wanna keep yourself from me
 When I don't have the strength
 I'm just a mirror of what I see But at your best, you are love
 You're a positive motivating force within my life
 Should you ever feel the need to wonder why
 Let me know, let me know Let me know When you feel, what you feel
 How hard for me to understand
 So many things have taken place
 Before this love affair began But if you feel, for like I feel
 Confusion can give way to doubt
 For there are times when I fall short of what I say
 What I say I'm all about, all about But at your best, you are love
 You're a positive motivating force within my life
 Should you ever feel the need to wonder why
 Let me know, let me know Tell me what it is
 (Tell me what it is)
 There's no need to make believe
 (Make believe, no need to make believe) Look beyond your own
 (Look beyond your own)
 Try to find a place for me
 (Try and find another place for me) 'Cause at your best, you are love
 You're a positive motivating force within my life
 Should you ever feel the need to wonder why
 Let me know, let me know Let me know, let me know, let me know
 See, stay at your best baby
