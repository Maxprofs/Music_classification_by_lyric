                        Bài hát: My Life Is A Party (R.I.O. Video Edit) - Italobrothers

I say "hey"
You say "ho"
Turn it up
Here we go-o

New York, LA
Berlin say "hey"
To Tokyo, Rio de Janeiro
Here we go, go

[Pre-chorus:]
Hello, hello
Can you just feel it?
Are you ready to go?
Hello, hello
Do you receive my echo

[Chorus:] 
My life is a party
My home is the club
I party like a rock star
Dance until I drop
My life is a party
My home is the club
My stage is the dancefloor
Party never stops
(2x)

(*)

I say "hey"
You say "ho"
Spin me round
Like a yo-yo

D.C, Paris
Bel Aire, say "yeah"
To Monaco, Santo Domingo
Here we go, go

(Pre-chorus)

(Chorus)

(*)

I say "hey"
You say "ho"
Spin me round
Like a yo-yo

(Pre-chorus)

(Chorus)

(*)

I say "hey"
You say "ho"
Spin me round
Like a yo-yo
                        
                    |
