                        Bài hát: Till I Die (Vocal: CASG) - Hiroyuki Sawano


I have to go somewhere I saw
When I was so young and immature
I want to know if truth is painful or not
Why my heart bleeds at the sight

Time will tell us gently
How powerless we used to be
Now is the time to raise my arm
Hate must be thrown away

Cuz I meant to be your piece until I die
No one's wanna be alone
I'll leave my soul by your side
Though we fall apart between the hell's divide
I would seek you all along
And smile me with starry eyes

You have to go you have in thought
When this world turns in so insecure
Fate that you owe is cruel, still you swallow
I can't igg your tender lies

Time will tell us gently
How powerless we used to be
Now is the time to raise my arm
Hate must be thrown away

Don't let me be your wound
Wash off all you've been bound
Always be safe and sound
Let me pray for you

Cuz I meant to be your piece until I die
No one's wanna be alone
I'll leave my soul by your side
Though we fall apart between the hell's divide
I would seek you all along
And smile me with starry eyes

Till I die
By your side
                        
                    |
