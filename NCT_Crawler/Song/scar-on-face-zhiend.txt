                        Bài hát: Scar On Face - ZHIEND

Recessive, my hair I wear in bangs
Recessive, getting long again
Recessive, I need get a trim
Recessive, but I don't wanna go

What I had held in my hands, just another illusion

Recessive, I'm not the stronger one
Recessive, just a living thing
Recessive, the light is way too bright
Recessive, need to get away

There remains a little scar on your face still facing down
To the ground you hold yourself and crouch like you've been wounded
I want to run away every time I see it

Recessive, every single thing
Recessive, distorted
Recessive, what may appear deformed
Recessive, cherish from the heart

There is no more yesterday
Have no future tomorrow

Recessive, from the very beginning
Recessive, knew this all along

I will send you flowers & strength of dignity with love
Something that will overflow and be out of your arms
So you can go ahead, live alone by yourself

Yes I see the scar on your face is like proof of warrior
That will stand up to anything & anytime that comes
So I close my eyes, cause it's too bright for me
                        
                    |
