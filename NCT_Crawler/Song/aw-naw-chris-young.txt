                        Song: Aw Naw - Chris Young

Yeah, I think I'm gonna leave
 I just had that one drink
 And we've all gotta be up early
 Boys, we oughta shut her down
 Just take it to the house
 Before anybody starts getting crazy So I started walking across the floor
 Before I got to the door Aw naw, somebody just bought a
 Shot of Patron, hang on
 I just might have to stay
 Aw naw, look at the time y'all
 What happened to coats on, long gone...
 I should be halfway home but aw naw Yeah, girl I saw you come in
 With all of your girlfriends
 Just cuttin' up and shooting Bacardi
 Yeah, I got my boys with me
 But we're just blowin' off steam
 Not lookin' to pick up anybody So I was gonna walk on by
 You turned around and we locked eyes Aw naw, did you hear that song,
 Oh the one that just came on
 Come on, DJ, what you trying to do?
 Aw naw, it would be so wrong
 If we didn't dance one
 Show off those jeans you painted on, aw naw, aw naw No, I didn't mean to be here this long
 I tried to leave so it ain't my fault.
 No I didn't mean to be holding you
 But tell me what was I supposed to do? Aw naw, somebody just bought a
 Shot of that Patron, hang on
 We've been here all night long
 Aw naw, it would be so wrong
 If we didn't dance one more song
 Show off those jeans you painted on, aw naw Yeah, aw naw
 Those jeans you painted on, aw naw
