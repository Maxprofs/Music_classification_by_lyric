                        Bài hát: Habits (Stay High) - Alex Goot, Madilyn Bailey

Staying in my play pretend
Where the fun, it got no end
Staying in my play pretend
Where the fun, it got no end
Staying in my play pretend
Where the fun, it got no end
Ooh
Can't go home alone again
Need someone to numb the pain 
Can't go home alone again
Need someone to numb the pain 
Can't go home alone again
Need someone to numb the pain 
Ooh
Staying in my play pretend
Where the fun, it got no end
Ooh
Can't go home alone again
Need someone to numb the pain 

You're gone and I gotta stay
High all the time
To -high to-
High all the time
To -high to-
High all the time
To keep you off my mind

High all the time
To -high to-
High all the time
To -high to-
High all the time
To keep you off my mind

Staying in my play pretend
Where the fun, it got no end
Staying in my play pretend
Where the fun, it got no end
Staying in my play pretend
Where the fun, it got no end
Ooh
Can't go home alone again
Need someone to numb the pain 
Can't go home alone again
Need someone to numb the pain 
Can't go home alone again
Need someone to numb the pain 
Ooh
Staying in my play pretend
Where the fun, it got no end
Ooh
Can't go home alone again
Need someone to numb the pain 

You're gone and I gotta stay
High all the time
To -high to-
High all the time
To -high to-
High all the time
To keep you off my mind

High all the time
To -high to-
High all the time
To -high to-
High all the time
To keep you off my mind
