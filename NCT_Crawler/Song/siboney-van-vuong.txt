                        Bài hát: Siboney - Văn Vượng 

If you've been in Havana
You have heard a dreamy tune
When you think of Havana
You recall this dreamy tune

If you've danced in Havana
You've caught its funny rhythm
That made your senses stray
Night and day, here's that tantalizing melody they play

Siboney, that's the tune
That they croon at you down Havana way
Siboney, that's the dance
That they dance at the cafe

And that tune brings you dreams
So it seems underneath the silver moon
As they play Siboney, every care will fade away
Fascinating, captivating, Siboney
                        
                    |
