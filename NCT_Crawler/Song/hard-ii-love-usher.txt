                        Bài hát: Hard II Love - Usher

Gotta crush on a new toy
And boy its never safe
Making all the bad choices
But its a brighter day

I know that I'm, hard to love, hard to love, hard to love
Hard to love, hard to love, hard to love
I know that I'm, hard to trust, hard to trust, hard to trust
Hard to trust, hard to trust, hard to trust

It's like you gambling falling for me
I'll kill you, you gon' lose
It's like you gambling falling for me
I'll kill you, you gon' lose you gon' lose, you gon' lose

It's like you gambling falling for me
I'll kill you, you gon' lose
It's like you gambling falling for me
I'll kill you, you gon' lose you gon' lose, you gon' lose

I'll send you back and forth, you'll never know you try your luck
They call me Las Vegas, you get what you pay for
Girl I match your lucky card, I'll make you take a loss
But I'm worth it, loves what we wage for

I know that I'm, hard to love, hard to love, hard to love
Hard to love, hard to love, hard to love
And I know that I'm, hard to trust, hard to trust, hard to trust
Hard to trust, hard to trust, hard to trust

It's like you gambling falling for me
I'll kill you, you gon' lose
It's like you gambling falling for me
I'll kill you, you gon' lose you gon' lose, you gon' lose

It's like you gambling falling for me
Might kill you, but you could win it all

I'mma make it free fall baby, fall into infinity
I'mma make it go real crazy, never like it seems
I'm your adrenaline, I'm your problem
I'm your amphetamine, you kiss all of me

It's like you gambling falling for me
I'll kill you, you gon' lose
It's like you gambling falling for me
I'll kill you, you gon' lose you gon' lose, you gon' lose

It's like you gambling falling for me
Might kill you, but you could win it all
