                        Lyrics : mpi
Music : Hiroyuki Sawano
Vocal: Mika Kobayashi

In the middle of night 
I was far from the flight
They freely pass me by

Then I'm totally out of space and seeking my friends
Is there anyone who needs me?

I hear what you say
There's the tiniest hope
You can change yourself
If you want to
Then you find the door
We can walk from the past
I was a frog in a well


Smile like you've never done
I'm so fine 
Then you hold me tight under bad weather
If you understand why
I was crying on the river so
Dwell on my self
All the time


And you follow the light
I was far from the flight
They freely pass me by

Then I'm totally out of space and seeking my friends
Is there anyone who needs me?

I hear what you say
There's the tiniest hope
You can change yourself
If you want to
Then you find the door
We can walk from the past
I was a frog in a well

Smile like you've never done
I'm so fine 
Then you hold me tight under bad weather
If you understand why
I was crying on the river so
Dwell on my self
All the time
                        
                    |
