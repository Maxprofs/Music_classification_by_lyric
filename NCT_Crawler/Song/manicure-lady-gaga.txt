Put some lipstick on
Perfume your neck and slip your high heels on
Rinse and curl your hair
Loosen your hips, and get a dress to wear

I'm the one who's been coming around looking to loving you
You're the medicine,
I need to heal the way you make me feel

I'm gon' be manicured
You wanna be manicured
Ma ma ma manicure
She wanna be manicured

Salon’s enough for her
Not to feel so insecure
Ma ma ma manicure
She won't be take care of, no

Can you feel it?
Can you feel it?
Can you feel it?
I’m addicted to the love that you give me
Can you feel it?
Can you feel it?
Can you feel it?
Like a serial killer, man is a goner

Touch me in the dark
Put your hands all over my body parts
Throw me on the bed
Squeeze, tease and please me–that's what I said!

'cause I'm the chick who's been coming around looking to loving you
You're the, the medicine
I need to heal the way, the way you make me feel

I'm gon' be manicured
You wanna be manicured
Ma ma ma manicure
She wanna be manicured

Salon’s enough for her
Not to feel so insecure
Ma ma ma manicure
She won't be take care of, no

Can you feel it?
Can you feel it?
Can you feel it?
I’m addicted to the love that you give me
Can you feel it?
Can you feel it?
Can you feel it?
Like a serial killer, man is a goner

Manicure!
Manicure!

Heal me
'CAUSE I'm ADDICTED TO LOVE
Save me
'CAUSE I'm ADDICTED TO LOVE
Manicure!

I'm gon' be manicured
You wanna be manicured
Ma ma ma manicure
She wanna be manicured

Salon’s enough for her
Not to feel so insecure
Ma ma ma manicure
She won't be take care of, no

Can you feel it?
Can you feel it?
Can you feel it?
I’m addicted to the love that you give me
Can you feel it?
Can you feel it?
Can you feel it?
Like a serial killer, man is a goner

(I'm gon' be manicured
You wanna be manicured
Ma ma ma manicure
She wanna be manicured)

Manicure!
Manicure!
