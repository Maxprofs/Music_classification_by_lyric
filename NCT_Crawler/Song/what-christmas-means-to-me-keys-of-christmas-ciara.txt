                        Bài hát: What Christmas Means To Me (Keys Of Christmas) - Ciara

Intro:
Oh yeah

Verse 1:
Candles burning and more
Lots of mistletoe
Lots of snow and ice
Everywhere we go
Choirs singing carols
Right outside my door

Chorus:
I want these things more
But that’s what Christmas means to me my love
Christmas means to me my love
Oh yeah

Verse 2:
I see your smiling face
Like I never seen before
And even though I love you madly
Seems I love you more
The little cards you give me
Touch my heart for sure

Chorus:
I want these things more, darling
That’s what Christmas means to me my love
Christmas means to me my love

Bridge:
I feel like I’m running wild
And angels like a little child
Reach underneath the mistletoe
Kiss you once, then some more
I wish you a merry Christmas, baby
And such happiness in the coming year, woah
Deck the halls with holly
And sing sweet Silent Night
I fill a tree with an angel head
And pretty, pretty lights
We’re gonna sleep and wake up
Just before daylight

Chorus:
I want these things more, baby
That’s what Christmas means to me my love
I want these things more, baby
That’s what Christmas means to me my love
Oh, I want these things more, baby
That’s what Christmas means, that’s what Christmas means to me
Oh baby, baby
Oh, all these things and more
That’s what Christmas means to me
That’s what Christmas means to me my love
                        
                    |
