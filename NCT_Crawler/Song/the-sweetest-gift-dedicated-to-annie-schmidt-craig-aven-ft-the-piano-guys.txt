                        Bài hát: The Sweetest Gift (Dedicated to Annie Schmidt) - Craig Aven, The Piano Guys

I’m not going to lie
Christmas really hurts this time 
Cause you’re not here to celebrate with me. 
Tears fill my eyes. 
And memories flood my mind
As I place your ornament upon our tree. 
Although this year I have a broken heart
It gives me hope and joy as I remember where you are. 

[Chorus:]
You’re with the Son of God. 
You’re with the Prince of Peace. 
You’re with the one we’re celebrating 
And that thought amazes me. 
Sometimes I still break down
Grieving that we’re apart
But the sweetest gift is knowing where you are. 
You’re with the Son of God. 

Got your picture in a frame 
And a stocking with your name. 
Oh God knows it’s been hard letting go. 
And I can’t bring you back
But I’ll see you again. 
And oh, that thought is healing to my soul. 
I’ll miss making angels with you in the snow. 
I guess instead you will be singing with them 
All around God’s throne. 

[Chorus:]

And I know the Christmas season 
Was your favorite time of year. 
You loved to help us decorate our tree. 
But now that you’re with Jesus
I can’t imagine how you feel 
Cause He’s the one who bled and died 
Upon the tree for you and me. 

[Chorus:]
                        
                    |
