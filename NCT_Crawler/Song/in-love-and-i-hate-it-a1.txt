                        You are, like the ocean
And you’re drowning me
The sun rise, casting shadows as far as I can see
Cause you’re so bitter sweet

I’m in love, I’m in love and I hate it
I’m in love and it’s so overrated
What am I supposed to do?
I wanna be with you

I’m in love, I’m in love, I can’t take it
I’m in love and I feel so naked
What am I supposed to do?
I wanna be with you

I’m in love and I hate it, hate it, hate it
I’m in love and I hate it, hate it, hate it
I’m in love and I hate it, hate it, hate it
I’m in love and I hate it, I hate it

Sometimes, I feel spineless 
I can’t stand up straight 
And sometimes, I’m so stupid
I make the same mistakes, but I can’t walk away

I’m in love, I’m in love and I hate it
I’m in love and it’s so overrated
What am I supposed to do?
I wanna be with you

I’m in love, I’m in love, I can’t take it
I’m in love and I feel so naked
What am I supposed to do?
I wanna be with you

I’m in love and I hate it, hate it, hate it
I’m in love and I hate it, hate it, hate it
I’m in love and I hate it, hate it, hate it
I’m in love and I hate it, I hate it

It’s the agony
It’s the ecstasy
And it’s thrilling me
It’s killing me, it’s killing me

I’m in love, I’m in looove...
I’m in love, I’m in love and I hate it
I’m in love and it’s so overrated
What am I supposed to do?
I wanna be with you

I’m in love, I’m in love, I can’t take it
I’m in love and I feel so naked
What am I supposed to do?
I wanna be with you

I’m in love and I hate it, hate it, hate it
I’m in love and I hate it, hate it, hate it
I’m in love and I hate it, hate it, hate it
I’m in love and I hate it, I hate it

I’m in love and I hate it, hate it, hate it
I’m in love and I hate it, hate it, hate it
I’m in love and I hate it, hate it, hate it
I’m in love and I hate it, I hate it
