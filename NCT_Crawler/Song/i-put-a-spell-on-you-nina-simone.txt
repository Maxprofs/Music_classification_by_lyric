                        I put a spell on you
 'Cause you're mine You better stop the things you do
 I ain't lyin', no, I ain't lyin' You know I can't stand it
 Your runnin' around
 You know better mama

 Because you're mine
 You're mine I love ya, I love you
 I love you, I love you anyhow
 And I don't care if you don't want me

 Because you're mine
