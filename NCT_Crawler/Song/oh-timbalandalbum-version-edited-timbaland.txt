 A aint got no fillin,
 Ama let these niggaz know,

 Now am spittin dem killer flows,
 Whatcha know bout me dog,

 Gotta problem you can C me in da streets dog,

 Don't take this lightly,
 If A want you dead it's done,

 A lotta niggaz tryna get in ma lane,
 Err body askin me da same ol thing, (What they say)

 [Verse 2:]
 A aint goin nowhere dog,
 Ama B right here in ya face,
 Can't do it like me dog,
 Ya kick drum aint got enough bass,
 Don't ever talk bad about me,
 You jus might make me mad,

 Its not the timbaland that you're used to,
 Now am in A whole nother zone,
 You can let me do me,
 You can do you,
 Or get popped in ya dome,
 Hit love on the verge 2 da block,
 So recognize da game,
 Timbaland aint gonna run nowhere baby,
 Timbaland got private planes,

 [Chorus:]

 [Verse 3:]

 Sometime long ago,

 [Chorus:]
