                        Bài hát: Anyway - Tyron Hapi, Mimoza

One guy, two guy count 'em all up
I had so many try
But they got me *** up and I
Guess I'm just looking for something better
I could be faded get lost in his eyes
Yeah he look fly
then again so do I
But u and I we look better together

Gon' let my hair down tonight
But at the end of the night
Baby he can forget it
Cause you're coming to get it

Cause I waited, I waited, I waited
For a guy like you
To save me, to save me, to save me
From the other dudes
If you want me you don't have to chase it
Like the others do
Cause baby you
Only you
You got me anyway

Ain't complicated it's just a trade
We can upgrade if u feel the same
Why would we settle for something lesser
Sometimes I mess up
And call him your name
Is it love on the brain
We keep on checking upon each other

Gon' let my hair down tonight
But at the end of the night
Baby he can forget it
Cause you're coming to get it

Cause I waited, I waited, I waited
For a guy like you
To save me, to save me, to save me
From the other dudes
If you want me you don't have to chase it
Like the others do
Cause baby you
Only you
You got me anyway
