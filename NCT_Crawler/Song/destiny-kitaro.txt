Title:Destiny
Lrc:

Feeling like an outcast of society, a man meets an alien,
who shows him that his destiny is not to live on Earth,
but to accomplish great things on another planet.

The future is nowhere
It comes to you like a divine star

One night when nightmares invaded my head
He appeared to me from the sky
Floated in the air, it dazzled my eyes
And he carried me for a flight

too tired to understand
I crossed the galaxy
Universe of fire I saw
Showed me so many ways
Then I felt lost in time
I'm a hero, an alien is a friend of mine

By a fantasy I have found my destiny
Then I knew, that all over the clouds of human kind
Exists another destiny
A world where is growing all love

IN his machine lights surrounded me
Flashed on my face so bright
Left behind me my memories and griefs
Run away after the past

So tired to understand
I crossed the galaxy
Universe of fire I saw
Showed me so many ways
Then I felt lost in time
I'm a hero, an alien is a friend of mine

By a fantasy I have found my destiny
Then I knew, that all over the clouds of human kind
Exists another destiny
A world where is growing all love

By a fantasy I have found my destiny
Then I knew, that all over the clouds of human kind
Exists another destiny
A world where is growing all love
By a fantasy I have found my destiny
A world where is growing all love
