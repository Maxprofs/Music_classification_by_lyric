Big, big booty
What you got a big booty
Big, big booty
What you got a big booty
Big, big booty
What you got a big booty
Big, big booty
What you?

Big, big booty
What you got a big booty
Big, big booty
What you got a big booty
Big, big booty
What you got a big booty
Big, big booty
What you?

Have you seen her on the dancefloor
She got the boom, shake the room
That's the lightning in the thunder
You wanna meet her, you wanna touch her
See the light in her eyes
And it starts to make you wonder

All the sexy girls in the party
Go and grab a man
Bring him to the dancefloor
Go and light them jeans
Don't you worry you're dancing
It's his birthday
Give him what he ask for
Let me show you how to do it

Big, big booty
What you got a big booty
Work
Big, big booty
What you got a big booty
Shake that
Big, big booty
What you got a big booty
Big, big booty
What you?

The way she moves
I know you want her
She like the fire, get you right
That's the lightning in the thunder
You wanna meet her, you gotta touch her
Hold on tight for the ride
Cause you know you're gonna love her

All the sexy girls in the party
Go and grab a man
Bring him to the dancefloor
Go and light them jeans
Don't you worry you're dancing
It's his birthday
Give him what he ask for
Let me show you how to do it

Big, big booty
What you got a big booty
Work
Big, big booty
What you got a big booty
Shake that
Big, big booty
What you got a big booty
Big, big booty


They begging me to drop down
On the floor right now
Iggy on the top
The last time the world's seen a booty this good
It was on "Jenny From The Block"
I got 'em all crazy lately
Baby, all the men on my magnet
Wanna tell all of my ladies
To get up on the floor
And just shake it, shake it

Y'all know where I been on
Y'all know where I been on
Queen Booty Iggy
Now find me a bone to sit on
Girls with those cheeks, put they hands in the air
And pop that, pop
Let 'em know that you're in here
See everybody wanna get a taste
Ya know that we got enough to share
But fact we girls with the big fat booty
Too fancy to ever play fair

Mesmerized by the size of it
You can't fight it
If you like, take your turn
I can guarantee you'll have the time of your life
Throw up your hands if you love a big booty

Big, big booty
What you
Big, big booty
What you
Let me show you how to do it
Work
Shake that

Big, big booty
What you got a big booty
Big, big booty
What you got a big booty
Big, big booty
What you got a big booty
Big, big booty
What you got a big booty

Shake that
