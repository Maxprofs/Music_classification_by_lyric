                        [Verse 1:]
 You faught
 but you were just too weak
 so you lost
 all the things you try to keep
 now you're on your knees, you're on your knees But wait,
 everything can change,
 in a moments time you don't have to be afraid,
 cause fear is just a lie
 open up your eyes [Chorus:]
 And he'll break
 open the skies to save
 those who cry out his name
 the One the wind and waves obey
 is strong enough to save you [Verse 2:]
 Look
 now is not too late
 lift up your head
 let the rain fall on your face
 youre not far from grace, your not too far from grace [Chorus:]
 And he'll break
 open the skies to save
 those who cry out his name
 the One the wind and waves obey
 is strong enough to save you
 [Repeat] [Bridge:]
 I know the weight of this world can take you down like gravity and I know the current of yourself can take you out, out to sea but hold on, hold on [Chorus:]
 And he'll break
 open the skies to save
 those who cry out his name
 the One the wind and waves obey
 is strong enough to save you
