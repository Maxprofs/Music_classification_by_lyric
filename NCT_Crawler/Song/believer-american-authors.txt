                        Bài hát: Believer - American Authors

I’m just a believer
That things will get better
Some can take it or leave it
But I don’t wanna let it go
[x2]

I’m a little bit sheltered
I’m a little bit scared
I’m a little bit nervous
I’m goin’ no where

I’m a little bit jealous
I’m a little bit slow
I’m a little bit hurtful 
And I don’t wanna let it go

No...
And I don’t wanna let it go

I’m a little bit angry 
When every one’s around
But I get a little lonely
When no one’s out

I feel my demons
Misleadin’ me

I’m just a believer
That things will get better
Some can take it or leave it 
But I don’t wanna let it go
[x2]

Maybe when I get older
And I’m in the ground
The weight’s off my shoulders 
It was bringin’ me down

I’ve never been that lucky 
I’ve never tasted fame
I’m always lookin’ for something
But I hate changin’

Time fades
There’s no space
As life breaks new ground

I’m just a believer
That things will get better
Some can take it or leave it 
But I don’t wanna let it go
[x2]

It doesn’t matter what is out there
My head is spinning and it won’t bail out
It doesn’t matter what is out there

Cause time fades
There’s no space
As life breaks new ground

I’m just a believer
That things will get better
Some can take it or leave it 
But I don’t wanna let it go
[x3]
