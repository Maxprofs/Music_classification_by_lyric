Avril Lavigne-Everything Back But You
Album:The Best Damn Thing

Today was the worst day
I went through hell
I wish I could remove it from my mind
Two months away from you
but I couldn\'t tell
I thought everything was
gonna be just fine

The post card that you wrote
with the stupid little note
Something wasn\'t quite right about it
It smelt like cheap perfume
and it didn\'t smell like you
There\'s no way you can get around it
Because you wrote
I wish you were her
You left out me
You left without me
And now you\'re somehwere out there
With some bitch slut psycho babe
I hate you, why are guys so lame
Everything I gave you well
Everything back but you

You first tried to tell me all along
That you werent the right one for me
My friends tried to tell me to be strong
I bet you didnt think that I would see

The postcard that you wrote
With the stupid little note
There wasn\'t something quite right about it
I wanna to see you cry
Like I did a thousand times
Now you\'re losing me you\'re losing me now
Because you wrote
I wish you were her
You left out me
You left without me
And now you\'re somehwere out there
With some bitch slut psycho babe
I hate you, why are guys so lame
Everything I gave you well
Everything back but you

The postcard that you wrote
With the stupid little note
There wasn\'t something quite right about it
It smelt like cheap perfume
and it didn\'t smell like you
There\'s no way you can get around it
Because you wrote
I wish you were her
You left out me
You left without me
And now you\'re somehwere out there
With some bitch slut psycho babe
I hate you, why are guys so lame
Everything I gave you well
Everything back but you
I wish you were her
You left out me
You left without me
Everything back but you
I wish you were her
You left out me
You left without me
Everything back but you
