                        Yes I can see her
Cause every girl in here wanna be her

Oh she's a diva, feel the same and i wanna meet her

They say she low down
It's just a rumor and i don't believe em
They say she needs to slow down
The baddest thing around town

She's nothing like a girl you've ever seen before
Nothing you can compare to your neighborhood hoe
I'm trying to find the words to describe this girl
Without being disrespectful

The way that booty moving i can't take no more
I have to stop what i'm doing so i can put on my clothes
I'm trying to find the words to describe this girl
Without being disrespectful

Damn girl

Damn girl you'se a sexy chick, a sexy chick, a sexy chick
Damn girl you'se a sexy chick, damn girl
Damn girl you'se a sexy chick, a sexy chick, a sexy chick
Damn girl you'se a sexy chick, damn girlyes i can see her

Cause every girl in here wanna be her

Oh she's a diva, feel the same and i wanna meet her

They say she low down
It's just a rumor and i don't believe em'
They say she needs to slow down
The baddest thing around town

She's nothing like a girl you've ever seen before
Nothing you can compare to your neighborhood hoe
I'm trying to find the words to describe this girl
Without being disrespectful

The way that booty moving i can't take no more
