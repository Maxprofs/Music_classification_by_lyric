                        Bài hát: Heart Of Stone (The Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn Ost Part 2) - Iko

Can you keep a secret
Will you hold your hand
Among the flames

Honey you're a shipwreck
With your heart of stone

Can I get a witness
To the processes
The wasted tears
If it dried a river
With your heart of stone

I can't breath
I can't breath, water, water
I can't breath
I can't breath, water, water
When you're here with me
You're not here with me

Can you pry a finger
From every single way
The same due
And I just can't forget you
With your heart of stone

I can't breath
I can't breath, water, water
I can't breath
I can't breath, water, water
I can't breath
I can't breath, water, water
I can't breath
I can't breath, water, water

When you're here with me
You're not here with me
                        
                    |
