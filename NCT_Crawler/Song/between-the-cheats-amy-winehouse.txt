                        I would die before divorce ya
 I'd take a thousand thumps for my love
 'Cause you kissed a lucky horseshoe
 Stuck it in my boxing glove
 Does anyone who will listen up
 To our victories and dumb defeats
 Knows they I'll take you to the cleaners
 If you come between the cheats Between the cheats
 Between the cheats
 Between the cheats My husband is the finest handsome hustler
 And he still makes this housewife blush
 So I go with him, my hand flicks
 I'm sitting on the royal flush Women drink him in
 Swim in him with green eyes
 Then go home and cash the chips you've got
 And here maybe two
 Oh two bottles of
 The jack of hearts is my jackpot [Chorus] Cause we all have to lock eyes
 And I know is my heart beat
 There's a winning secret to both
 And it's sworn between the cheats Between the cheats
                        
                    |
