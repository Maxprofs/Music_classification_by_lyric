                        Let's go to the beach, each
Let's go get away
They say, watch they gonna say?

Have a drink, clink, found the Bud Light
Bad girls like me, is hard to come by
The Patron, own, let's go get it on

The zone, own, Yes I'm in the zone
Is it two, three, leave a good tip
I'm a blow all my money 
and don't give two *s

I'm on the floor, floor
I love to dance
So give me more, more,
still I can stand

Get on the floor, floor
Like it's your last chance
If you want more, more
Then here I am

Starships were meant to fly
Hands up and touch the sky
Can't stop 'cause we're so hight
Let's do this one more time

Starships were meant to fly
Hands up and touch the sky
Let's do this one last time
Can't stop... 
Higher than any other!!!

Jumped in my hooptie hooptie hoop
I own that
And I ain't paying my rent this month
I own that

But mack who you want,
and mack who you like
That's our life, theres no end in sight
Twinkle, twinkle little star

Now everybody let me
hear you say ray ray ray
Now spend all your money
'Cause to day pay day
And if you're a G, you a G, G, G
My name is Unique and you 
can call me Nicki

Get on the floor, floor
Like it's your last chance
If you want more, more
Then here I am

Starships were meant to fly
Hands up and touch the sky
Can't stop 'cause we're so hight
Let's do this one more time

Starships were meant to fly
Hands up and touch the sky
Let's do this one last time
Can't stop... 
Higher than any other!!!

Starships were meant to fly
Hands up and touch the sky
Can't stop 'cause we're so hight
Let's do this one more time

Starships we're meant to fly
Hands up and touch the sky
Let's do this one last time
Can't stop... 
Higher than any other!!!
