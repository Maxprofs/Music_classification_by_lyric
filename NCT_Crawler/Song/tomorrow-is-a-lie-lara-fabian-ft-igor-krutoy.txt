                        Never we should not say never
We shouldn't plan another day
the day is here to make it all clear
Never we should not surrender
The silence, the desire blinded by our fears
When faith carries our dreams
So secretly, intensively, passionately...
Tomorrow is a lie
Time only stands for here and now
What you see passing by
Is your only chance to fly.
Tomorrow is a lie
No matter what your dreams are
You cannot wait in line
Today is the day, believe in what you say
Always keep your heart in action
Walk your life through passion
Think about the dream
We are what we think
Always do things with devotion
Your feelings are emotion
Shining like a spread through and inside your head
Intensively, passionately, evidently...
Tomorrow is a lie
Time only stands for here and now
What you see passing by
Is your only chance to fly.
Tomorrow is a lie
No matter what your dreams are
You cannot wait in line
Today is the day, believe in what you say
Shining like a spread through and inside your head
Intensively, passionately, evidently...
Tomorrow is a lie
Time only stands for here and now
What you see passing by
Is your only chance to fly.
Tomorrow is a lie
No matter what your dreams are
You cannot wait in line
Today is the day, believe in what you say !
