                        Bài hát: Touch My Hand - David Archuleta

Saw you from a distance 
Saw you from the stage 
Something about the look in your eyes 
Something about your beautiful face 

In a sea of people 
There is only you 
I never knew what the song was about 
But suddenly now I do 

Trying to reach out to you, touch my hand 
Reach out as far as you can 
Only me, only you and the band 
Trying to reach out to you, touch my hand 

Can't let the music stop 
Can't let this feeling end 
'Cause if I do, it'll all be over 
I'll never see you again 

Can't let the music stop 
Until I touch your hand 
'Cause if I do, it'll all be over 
I'll never get the chance again 
I'll never get the chance again 
I'll never get the chance again 

I see the sparkle of a million flashlights 
A wonder wall of stars 
But the one that's shining out so bright 
Is the one right where you are 

Trying to reach out to you, touch my hand 
Reach out as far as you can 
Only me, only you and the band 
Trying to reach out to you, touch my hand 

Can't let the music stop 
Can't let this feeling end 
'Cause if I do, it'll all be over 
I'll never see you again 

Can't let the music stop 
Until I touch your hand 
'Cause if I do, it'll all be over 
I'll never get the chance again 
I'll never get the chance again 

Saw you from the distance 
Saw you from the stage 
Something about the look in your eyes 
Something about your beautiful face 

Can't let the music stop 
Can't let this feeling end 
'Cause if I do, it'll all be over 
I'll never see you again 

Can't let the music stop 
Until I touch your hand 
'Cause if I do, it'll all be over 
I'll never get the chance again 
I'll never get the chance again 
(Reach out to you, touch my hand) 

I'll never get the chance again 
(Reach out as far as you can) 
I'll never get the chance again 
(Only me, only you and the band) 
Trying to reach out to you, touch my hand, yeah
                        
                    |
