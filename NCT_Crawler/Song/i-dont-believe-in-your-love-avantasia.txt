                        No one around to hear your cries
No one there to even realize you grit your teeth
What are you afraid to lose when you're left alone?
I’m the one to make you anything you wanna be

Never broke the silence
Never broke the ice
No more waiting
I gotta wipe her of my mind
Loving her is dying
Loving her is pain
Babylon I'm coming
Ready for the fray

I don't believe in your love
Tread on this bed of roses
I don't believe in your love
Don’t give a * for roses

Don't give a damn for roses – No, no, no

You've been standing on the edge
Lost between the worlds of agony and ecstasy
Take your share boy straightaway
It's all heaven sent
She won't care
They call their love divine but it's all evil

Loving you was bleeding
So I had to break away
Darkness stretching out its hand
To save me from your sway
Cause loving you was wasting
Loving you was pain

Now angel of temptation
Open up the gate

I don't believe in your love
Tread on this bed of roses
I don't believe in your love
Don't give a * for roses

Loving you was bleeding
So I had to break away
Darkness stretching out it's hand
To save me from your sway
Cause loving you was wasting
Loving you was pain
Now angel of temptation
Open up the gate
Cause loving you was wasting


I don't believe in your love
Tread on this bed of roses
I don't believe in your love
Don't give a * for roses

I don't believe in your love - (I don't believe in your love)
Tread on this bed of roses - (This bed of roses)
I don't believe in your love - (No, I don't believe in your love)
Don't give a * for roses

No, I don't believe
I don't believe in your love
Your love, ooh, no, no, no, no
No, I don't believe in your love
