                        Shake it up, shake it down
 Move it in, move it around
 Disco lady

 Move it in, move it out
 Move it in, round about
 Disco lady

 Shake it up, shake it down
 Move it in, move it around
 Disco lady, well

 Hey, s*** lady
 Said I like the way
 You move your thing
 Lord, have mercy, girl

 You dance so fine
 And you're right on time
 Girl, you ought to be on tv
 On Soul Train

 When you get the groove
 There ain't no stopping
 Just can't help it
 I'm finger popping

 Shake it up, shake it down
 Move it in, move it around
 Disco lady, well

 Move it in, move it out
 Move it in, round about
 Disco lady

 Shake it, baby, shake it
 Baby, shake your thing (one time)
 Shake it, baby, shake it
 Baby, shake your thing

 You got me grooving
 (Do the Hustle, baby)
 I feel like moving
 (Do the Hustle, baby)
 You've got me moving
 (Do the Hustle, baby)
 Can't sit still, I'm grooving
 (Do the Hustle, baby)
 I like that funky stuff

 Shake it up, shake it down
 Move it in, move it around
 Disco lady, well

 Move it in, move it out
 Shove it in, round about
 Disco lady

 Hey, s*** lady
 Girl, you drive me crazy
 (Shake it, shake it)
 You dance so fine
 (Shake it, shake it)
 And you're right on time
 Girl, you drive me
 (Shake it, shake it)
 Out of my mind, yeah

 If it wasn't for the girl
 Sitting next to me
 (Shake it, shake it)
 I'd jump right up and
 Outta my safety seat
 (Shake it, shake it)

 You got me hypnotized
 So mesmerized, girl
 (Shake it, shake it)
 You're moving me, girl
 You're grooving me
 (Shake it, shake it)

 Honey child
 (Shake it, shake it)
 Shake that thing
 Shake it on down
 (Shake it, shake it)
 Move that thing
 Down to the ground

 (Shake it, shake it)
 (Shake it, shake it)
 (Shake it, shake it)
 (Shake it, shake it)

 Shake it up, shake it down
 Move it in, move it around
 Disco lady, well

 Move it in, move it out
 Shove it in, round about
 Disco lady, hey

 You got me sick
 Here in this discotecque
 Girl, you're moving me
 Girl, you're grooving me

 Move it in, move it out
 Shove it in, round about
 Disco lady...
