                        Bài hát : The Yellow Rose Of Texas - Mitch Miller

There's a yellow rose in Texas
I'm going home to see
Though other men have held her
Her heart belongs to me

You've traveled down some dusty roads
Slept out in the rain
But this yellow rose is always here
When you come home again

She knows I've done some hard time
You stumbled then you fell
I just kept your pride from dying
You saved my soul from hell

She's the diamond of the desert
She's the golden flower of spring
She's the yellow rose of Texas
She can make a man a king

There's a yellow rose in Texas
She knows the dues I've paid
And I'm going home to tell her
I wish I'd never strayed

You couldn't see beyond yourself
Your pain and wounded pride
But now you know the truth is
In the way you feel in side

She knows I've done some hard time
You stumbled then you fell
I just kept your pride from dying
And you saved my soul from hell

She's the diamond of the desert
She's the golden flower of spring
She's the yellow rose of Texas
She can make a man a king

Yes the yellow rose of Texas can
She can make a man a king
