                        I walk to the door, see your lovely face
 All the things I wanna do doesn't want
 Wanna race, no Visions of you on holding me, I can't wait now
 I can feel you kissing me, oh, so softly
 Making love, baby, I could feel your heart beat
 Oh, don't stop, baby, what you do to me? What you do to me? Do to me, baby
 Oh, what you do? What you do to me?
 Do, to me, baby, do, to me Come on, baby, I could see it in your eyes
 All the love you have inside
 Oh, baby, give me your love
 Oh, what you do to me? What you do to me? Come on, do to me, baby
 What you do to me? Baby, what you do to me?
 Do to me, baby, do to me I don't care what they say
 I'm gonna love you anyway
 'Cause, boy, nobody makes me feel
 Boy, I've never felt this way All your touches, all your kisses
 Boy, you know just what I'm missing
 I want to stay What you do to me? Tell me what you do? Do to me, baby
 Come on, baby, and tell me what you do?
 What you do to me? Oh, what you do? Do, to me, baby
 Do to me
