                        Bài hát: Suit & Tie Featuring Jay Z - Justin Timberlake

[Justin Timberlake:]
I be on my suit and tie ***, tie ***, tie
I be on my suit and tie ***, tie ***
Can I show you a few things?
A few things, a few things, little baby, cause
I be on my suit and tie ***, tie ***
I be on my suit and tie ***, tie ***
Let me show you a few things.
Let me show you a few things.

[Timbaland:]
Wait a minute. You ready, JT?

I can't wait til I get you on the floor good-looking
Hey, going out so hot just like an oven
And I'll burn myself but just have to touch it
It's so fly and it's all mine
Hey baby, we don't mind all the watching, high
'Cause if they study close, real close then they might learn something
She ain't nothing but a little doozy when she does it
She's so fly, tonight.

Chorus:
And as long as I've got my suit and tie
I'ma leave it all on the floor tonight
And you got fixed up to the nines
Let me show you a few thing.
All dressed up in black and white
And you're dressed in that dress I like
Love is swinging in the air tonight
Let me show you a few things.
Let me show you a few things.
Show you a few things about love
While we're in the swing of love
Let me show you a few things,
Show you a few things about love, hey.

Stop: let me get a good look at it
Uh so thick, now I know why they call it a fatty
*** so sick gotta hit and picked up a habit
That's all right, 'cause you're all mine
Go on and show 'em who you call daddy
I guess they're just mad cause girl, they wish they had it
My killer, my filler, yeah you're a classic
And you're all mine..tonight.

[Chorus:]

Hey, get out ya seat, Hov

[Jay-Z:]
All black at the white shows
White shoes at the black shows
Green card for the Cuban linx
Y'all sit back and enjoy the light show
Nothing exceeds like the sex
Style got..for having the best of the best
Is this what it's all about
I'm at the rex, the..my rent disturbing the guests
Years of distress, tears on the dress
Try to hide her face with some makeup sex
UH, this is trouble season
Tom Ford tuxedos for no reason
All saints for my angel
Alexander Wang too
Ass-tight Denim and some Dunks
I'll show you how to do this young!
No papers, catch favors
Get high, out Vegas
Who says these devils ain't looking for trouble
You just got good genes so a nigga tryin cuff you
Tell your mother that I love her cause I love you
Tell your father we go farther as a couple
They ain't lose a daughter, got a son
I'll show you how to do this, huh!

[Chorus:]
                        
                    |
