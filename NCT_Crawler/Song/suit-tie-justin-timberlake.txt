                        Bài hát: Suit & Tie - Justin Timberlake

I be on my suit and tie sh*t, tie sh*t, tie
I be on my suit and tie sh*t, tie sh*t
Can I show you a few things?
A few things, a few things, little baby cause
I be on my suit and tie sh*t, tie sh*t
I be on my suit and tie sh*t, tie sh*t
Let me show you a few things
Let me show you a few things

[Verse 1]
I can't wait til I get you on the floor, good-looking
Going out so hot, just like an oven
And I'll burn myself, but just had to touch it
It's so fly and it's all mine
Hey baby, we don't mind all the watching
Cause if they study close, real close
They might learn something
She ain't nothing but a little doozy when she does it
She's so fly tonight

[Hook]
And as long as I've got my suit and tie
I'mma leave it all on the floor tonight
And you got fixed up to the nines
Let me show you a few things
All pressed up in black and white
And you're dressed in that dress I like
Love is swinging in the air tonight
Let me show you a few things
Let me show you a few things
Show you a few things about love
While we’re in the swing of love
Let me show you a few things
Show you a few things about love
Hey

[Verse 2]
Stop, let me get a good look at it
So thick, now I know why they call it a fatty
Sh*t so sick got a hit and picked up a habit
That's alright, cause you're all mine
Go on and show 'em who you call daddy
I guess they're just mad cause girl, they wish they had it
My killer, my filler, yeah you're a classic
And you're all mine tonight

[Hook]
And as long as I've got my suit and tie
I'mma leave it all on the floor tonight
And you got fixed up to the nines
Let me show you a few things
All pressed up in black and white
And you're dressed in that dress I like
Love is swinging in the air tonight
Let me show you a few things
Let me show you a few things
Show you a few things about love
While we’re in the swing of love
Let me show you a few things
Show you a few things about love

[Verse 3]
All black at the white shows
White shoes at the black shows
Green card for the Cuban links
Y'all sit back and enjoy the light show
Nothing exceeds like the excess
Stoute got gout from having the best of the best
Is this what it's all about?
I'm at the restaurant with my rant
Disturbing the guests
Years of distress, tears on the dress
Try to hide her face with some makeup sex
This is truffle season
Tom Ford tuxedos for no reason
All saints for my angel
Alexander Wang too
Ass-tight Denim and some Dunks
I'll show you how to do this young!
No papers, catch vapors
Get high, out Vegas
Who says the devils ain't looking for trouble
You just got good genes so a nigga tryna cuff you
Tell your mother that I love her cause I love you
Tell your father we go farther as a couple
They ain't lose a daughter, got a son
I show you how to do this, hun!

[Hook]
And as long as I've got my suit and tie
I'mma leave it all on the floor tonight
And you got fixed up to the nines
Let me show you a few things
All pressed up in black and white
And you're dressed in that dress I like
Love is swinging in the air tonight
Let me show you a few things
Let me show you a few things
Show you a few things about love
While we’re in the swing of love
Let me show you a few things
Show you a few things about love
Hey
