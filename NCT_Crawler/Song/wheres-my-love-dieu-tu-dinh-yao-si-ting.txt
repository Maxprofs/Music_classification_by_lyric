                        Where's my love

Where's my love
The one for me
Somewhere too far
Not close enough for me to see

Where's my love
Who could you be
Someone i knew but
Let slip through
While dreaming of you

Oh love
Oh love
Come to me

Where's my love
Give me a clue
Give me a time
Show me a place
I might find you

Where's my love
Don't hide from me
I'll be good to you
I will
Honestly
Oh love
Oh love
Come to me

Where's my love
The one for me
Somewhere too far
Not close enough for me to see

Where's my love
Now I sing
Hoping someday you'll
Bring our lovely ending

Oh love
Oh love
Come to me
Oh love
Oh love
Come to me
