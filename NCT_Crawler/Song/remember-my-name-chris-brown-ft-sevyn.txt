                        Verse 1: I need your touch... But your hands are locked away.
 I hear your voice... You got nothing, left to say.
 I take this scar.. off my heart.
 I'll take this bullet, I'll take for love.
 So if the lights in the sky, come crashing now.
 I still can find your love even in the crowd... But will you remember meeee.
 Chorus:
 Will you remember, my name?
 Remember my name?
 Will you remember my name?
 Remember.. my, name.
 Remember my.. Remember. My, name. (2x)
 Verse 2: I need your kiiiiss!.. But your lips are far awaaay!
 So I have no choooice, so I guess I'll, have to stay a love awaaay.
 And I'll take this SCAAAR! From my heart!
 Bang bang. I'll take this bullet.
 Bang bang. I'll take it for LOOOVE! Bang bang.
 I'll take for LOOOOVE!... I'll take for looove!
 Chorus:
 Will you remember, my name?...
 Remember my name?
 Will you remember my name?
 Remember.. my, name.
 Remember my.. remember my, name.
 Remember my, remember my, name.
 Verse 3:
 Floating. Above. The clouds, and sky.
 Wishing. Upon. A falling. Star.
 Hoping. My looove... Hasn't forgotten my naaaaa-aaame.
 It's automatic.
 This attraction.
 This love.

 Two birds.

 Wishing we can float off.
 We can flyyyy. Hiiiiigh.
