                        Bài hát: Low - Greyson Chance

[Chorus]
I am lost and I don't know where to go no more
I've been hurt but I've never been hurt this much before
I feel lonely, lonely, lonely traveling down this road
They say through time I'll find some healing but the clock goes slow
I didn't know that I could get this low

[Post-Chorus]
And I, and I don't know where to go
And I, and I, know, know
And I, and I don't know where to go
And I don't know where to go
And I don't know where to go

[Verse 1]
I see a dark reflection in my dashboard
Don't even know where I'm driving to anymore
I think about us back together someday
What you doing this Sunday
I needed space so I left home
But now I'm desperate for the things I know
Like how you made me laugh on a bad day

[Chorus]
I am lost and I don't know where to go no more
I've been hurt but I've never been hurt this much before
I feel lonely, lonely, lonely traveling down this road
They say through time I'll find some healing but the clock goes slow
I didn't know that I could get this low

[Post-Chorus]
And I don't know where to go
                        
                    |
