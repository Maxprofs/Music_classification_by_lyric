                        I can't see why you said goodbye
 And bring in my happy world such a lonely blue
 I don't know how I can make it now cause I can't see me without you I woke up this morning feeling mighty fine
 I can't find out until now baby's no longer mine
 I can't see why you said goodbye... Walking down a Happy Street looking for my man
 It turned into a Lonely Street he was holdin' another girl's hand
 I can't see why you said goodbye...
 I can't see me without you
