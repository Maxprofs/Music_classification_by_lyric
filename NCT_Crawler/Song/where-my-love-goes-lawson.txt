                        Bài hát: Where My Love Goes - Lawson

My love goes out of my heart and into the wind
Out my guitar and under your skin
Into your house and out of your headphones
That's where my love goes

Wherever you go, I'll follow
Don't worry about tomorrow
I will be in your shadow
Walking right beside you everyday
I'll be the one to save ya
When I put my pen to paper
Feels like it brings us closer
Even when you're so far away

Bullet trains and aeroplanes
I can't choose the easy way
So I'll send a signal just for you

My love goes out of my heart and into the wind
Out my guitar and under your skin
Into your house and out of your headphones
My love goes out of your door and into the street
Down through the fleet and up through your feet
Into your car and out of your radio,
That's where my love goes!

You will never be lonely
Just relax and listen to me
I breathe the air that you breathe
I am always with you in disguise.
Bullet trains and aeroplanes
I can't choose the easy way
So I'll send a signal just for you

My love goes out of my heart and into the wind
Out my guitar and under your skin
Into your house and out of your headphones
(Hello, you're not alone)
My love goes out of your door and into the street
Down through the fleet and up through your feet
Into your car and out of your radio,
That's where my love goes!

That's where my love goes,
Tell me can you hear me now?
I'm screaming out so loud!
Oh, it goes out of my heart and into the wind
Out my guitar and under your skin
Into your house and out of your radio! Oooh

Out of my heart and into the wind
Out my guitar and under your skin
Into your house and out of your headphones
My love goes out of your door and into the street
Down through the fleet and up through your feet
Into your car and out of your radio
That's where my love goes
Yeah, that's where my love goes
My love goes out of your door and into the street
Down through the fleet and up through your feet
Into your car and out of your radio
That's where my love goes
