                        Bài hát: Do My Thang - Miley Cyrus

Every single night and every single day 
Imma do my thang, Imma do my thang
So don't you worry 'bout me Imma be okay
Imma do my thang, cause Imma do my thang 
And Imma, Imma, Imma do my thang 
And Imma, Imma, Imma do my
Imma do my thang
Imma do my thang

Bang Bang
Imma shoot 'em down baby
Look at me, I'm high up off the ground baby 
Oh shoot, pass that *** around baby
That *** true, but I don't hear a sound baby 
I'm a southern bell crazier then hell
Getting wild up in here
Getting live up in here
Burning up up in here
Turn up in here
We tear the roof up now we up out of here

We do it, we do it
We don't give a ***
Only thang we think about is turning up, turning up
We do it, we do it
We do it all the way
live so everybody hands the sky cause

Every single night and every single day 
Imma do my thang, Imma do my thang
So don't you worry 'bout me Imma be okay
Imma do my thang, cause Imma do my thang 
And Imma, Imma, Imma do my thang 
And Imma, Imma, Imma do my
Imma do my thang
Imma do my thang

Bang B!TCH
You think I'm strange B!TCH
It's bananas like a ***ing rangatang B!TCH
Don't worry 'bout me 
I got it all arranged B!TCH
Mind your business, stay in your lane B!TCH
Oh yeah, I'm a southern bell 
I told you ya'll once before I get crazier than hell
Get wild up in here
Get live up in here
Turn up up in here
Burning up in here 

We do it, we do it
We don't give a ***
Only thang we think about is turning up, turning up
We do it, we do it
We do it all the way
live so everybody hands the sky cause

Every single night and every single day 
Imma do my thang, Imma do my thang
So don't you worry 'bout me Imma be okay
Imma do my thang, cause Imma do my thang 
And Imma, Imma, Imma do my
Imma do my thang
