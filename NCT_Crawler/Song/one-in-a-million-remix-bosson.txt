                        Bài hát: One in a million (Remix) - Bosson

Sometimes I can hate you every day 
Sometimes you can fall for everyone you see 
Only one can really make me stay 
A sign from the sky said to me. 

[CHORUS] 
You're one in a million, you're once in a lifetime 
You make me discover what are the stars above us 
You're one in a million, you're once in a lifetime 
You make me discover what are the stars above us 

I've been looking for that special one 
And I've been searching for someone to give my love 
And when I thought that all the hope was gone 
The smile there you were and I was gone 

Always will remember how I felt that day 
Feeling indescribable to me. Yeah! 
Always knew there was always an answer for my prayer 
And you, you're the one, the one for me! 

[CHORUS] x 2 

I was cool and everything was possible 
You tried to catch me but it wasn't possible 
Nobody could hurt me it was my game 
Until I met you baby and went insane 

And when you didn't want me, I wanted you 
Because the finer thing bout it was I like to go 
I like it when its difficult I like it when it's hard 
You know it's worth it if ya find your heart
                        
                    |
