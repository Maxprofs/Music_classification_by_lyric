                        My funny Valentine, sweet comic Valentine
 You make me smile with my heart
 Your looks are laughable, unphotographable
 Yet, you're my favorite work of art Is your figure less than Greek?
 Is your mouth a little weak?
 When you open it to speak
 Are you smart? But don't change your hair for me
 Not if you care for me
 Stay little Valentine, stay!
 Each day is Valentines day Is your figure less than Greek?
 Is your mouth a little weak?
 When you open it to speak
 Are you smart? But don't change your hair for me
 Not if you care for me
 Stay little Valentine, stay!
 Each day is Valentines day
