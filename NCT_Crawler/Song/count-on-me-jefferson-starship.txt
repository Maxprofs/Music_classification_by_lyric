                        Precious love, I'll give it to you
 Blue as the sky and deep in the eyes of a love so true
 Beautiful face, you make me feel
 Lite on the stairs and lost in the air of a love so real And you can count on me
 Count on my love
 Count on me
 Count on my love to see you through Emerald eyes and China perfume
 Caught in the wheel and lost in the feel of a love so soon
 Ruby lips, you make my song
 Into the night and saved by the lite of a love so strong And you can count on me
 Count on my love, baby
 Count on me
 Count on my love to see you through Ooh, you can count on me, girl
 Count on my love Precious love, I'll give it to you
 Blue as the sky and deep in the eyes of a love so true
 Beautiful face, you make me feel
 Lite on the stairs and lost in the air of a love so real And you can count on me
 Count on my love, baby
 Count on me
 Count on my love, baby Count on me
 Count on my love, baby
 Count on me
 Count on my love
