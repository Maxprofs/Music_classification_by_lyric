                        Bài hát: September - Earth Wind & Fire

Do you remember, the 21st night of September 
Love was changing the minds, 
Pretenders while chasing the clouds away 

Our hearts were ringing, 
In the key that our souls were singing 
As we danced in the night,
Remember how the stars stole the night away 

Ba deya-say do you remember 
Ba deya-dancing in September 
Ba deya-never was a cloudy day 

My thoughts are with you 
Holding hands with with your heart to see you 
Only blue talk and love,
Remember how we knew love was here to stay 

Now December, found the love that we shared in September 
Only blue talk and love,
Remember the true love we share today 

Ba deya-say do you remember 
Ba deya-dancing in September 
Ba deya-never was a cloudy day 

Ba de ya-say do you remember 
Ba de ya-dancing in September 
Ba de ya-golden dreams are shiny days 

The bell was ringing 
Our souls were ringing 
Do you remember, never was a cloudy day 

Ba deya-say do you remember 
Ba deya-dancing in September 
Ba deya-never was a cloudy day
                        
                    |
