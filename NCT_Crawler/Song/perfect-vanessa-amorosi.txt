                        Bài hát: Perfect - Vanessa Amorosi

Stay forever who you are
Don't change a thing
Because you're perfect

You sway gently in the breeze
In between my dreams
It kind of makes me nervous

You're storm, yeah, the lightning striking down
To only strike me once, would still be worth it

In my dreams you were perfect
When I woke you were perfect

Love, as scaring as it is
Tell me is it real,
If it ain't perfect?

I pray with the sounding of you faith
My colours bleed to one
Nothing grows when your love is gone

In my dreams you were perfect
When I woke you were perfect

Hmm, even when you run you're still worth it
Here and now, the moments perfect
You're perfect
So perfect
When you run
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, baby
Oh run, yeah

Even when you're gone, even when you're here, even when you're not
You're still, you're still, you're still
Perfect
                        
                    |
