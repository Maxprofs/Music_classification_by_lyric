                        A moment of madness
It's happened before
It could turn into sadness or a civil war
You've got me changing all I ever thought

When you first got so mad lost your rag
Trying to some save some trees
Angry cries, saw your thighs
And I fell to my knees
Oh my god what is this?
It's a moment of madness,

When we drank too much beer
Lost our fear
Our defenses were down
You got up tried your luck
Bought a dubious round
It can be hard to resist
It's a moment of madness

A promise of passion
A trailer of sin
A smiling assassin
The demon within
Endorphins are raging
Resistance is thin

And you're blowing my mind
‘Cause I find that your theories of life
Are insane, feed my brain
I could listen all night
I can't leave till we kiss
It's a moment of madness

And I just wanna stare at your hair
And imagine you opening your door
In your drawer there's some leather in there
I refuse, you persist
It’s a moment of madness

You know I’m not asking a lot,
Only your life,
I don't want to get what I want,
But I'm willing to try,
And I'm gonna ask you to stop,
But I'm full of lies

When you first got so mad lost your rag
Trying to save some trees
Angry cries, saw your thighs
And I fell to my knees
Oh my God what is this?
It's a moment of madness

And I just wanna stare at your hair
And imagine you opening your door
In your drawer there's some leather in there
I refuse, you persist
It’s a moment of madness
                        
                    |
