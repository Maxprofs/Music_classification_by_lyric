                        Song: I Am Here - P!nk

I open up my heart
You can love me or not
There's no such thing as sin
Let it all come right in
I wanna make some mistakes, I wanna sleep in the mud
I wanna swim in the flood, I wanna *** 'til I'm done
I like whiskey on ice, I like sun in my eyes
I wanna burn it all down, so let's start a fire
I wanna be lost, so lost that I'm found
Naked and laughing with my blood on the ground

[Chorus]
I am here, I am here
I've already seen the bottom, so there's nothing to fear
I know that I'll be ready when the devil is near
I am here, I am here
All of this wrong, but I'm still right here
I don't have the answers, but the question is clear

[Post-Chorus]
Let me ask you
Where does everybody go when they go?
Where does everybody go when they go?
Where does everybody go when they go?
Let me ask you
Where does everybody go when they go?
Where does everybody go when they go?
Where does everybody go when they go?
Let me ask you


[Verse 2]
May the light be upon me
May I feel in my bones that I am enough
I can make anywhere home
My fingers are clenched, my stomach's in knots
My heart it is racing, but afraid I am done
Afraid I am done

[Chorus]
I am here, I am here
I've already seen the bottom, so there's nothing to fear
I know that I'll be ready when the devil is near
Cause I am here, I am here
All of this wrong, but I'm still right here
I don't have the answers, but the question is clear

[Post-Chorus]
Let me ask you
Where does everybody go when they go?
Where does everybody go when they go?
Where does everybody go when they go?
Let me ask you
Where does everybody go when they go?
Where does everybody go when they go?
Where does everybody go when they go?
Let me ask you


[Bridge]
I can think of one thousand places
Much worse than this

[Chorus]
But I am here, I am here
I've already seen the bottom, so there's nothing to fear
I know that I'll be ready when the devil is near
Cause I am here, I am here
All of this wrong, but I'm still right here
I don't have the answers, but the question is clear

[Post-Chorus]
Let me ask you
Where does everybody go when they go?
Where does everybody go when they go?
Where does everybody go when they go?
Let me ask you
Where does everybody go when they go?
Where does everybody go when they go?
Where does everybody go when they go?
Oh, let me ask you
Oh, let me ask you
Ooh, ooh
So let me ask you
                        
                    |
