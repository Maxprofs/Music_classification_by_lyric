Rock|

                        I fought the spirit
 With a sword in my side
 Cheat... What a way out
 Crack my rib, wait to die
 I think I know you best when I sleep
 I think I know everything Me and my brothers
 We have tongues sharp as knives
 I found a way out
 Make a noise, close your eyes
 I think I talk to you best when I sing
 I sing about almost everything Oh god I need it
 So let me see again
 Take me to the river
 And let me see again
 Oh my god
 Let me see again
 Oh my god
 Let me see again
 Let me see again Grace taught a debtor
 Daily I'm strained to me
 God how I feel it
 Fetter pride to your feet I'm gonna leave you the first chance I get [4x] Oh god I need it
 Well I was wrong again
 Take me to the river
 And make me clean again
 Oh my god
 Make me clean again
 And oh my god
 Let me see again
                        
                    |
