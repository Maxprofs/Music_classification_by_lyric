                        You might lose your faith in science. 
You might lose faith in wealth.
You might lose your faith in Jesus, 
or lose faith in yourself.

But, when I let you down, 
look past your doubt.
Just, please, please, 
don't lose your faith in me.

You could lose faith in music, 
or lose faith in your friends.
You could lose your faith in breathing,
feel trapped in your own skin.

Oh, but I'll be right there beside you,
when the walls are caving in.
Oh, I'm not going anywhere.
But, when I let you down, 
look past your doubt.
Just please, please, 
don't lose your faith in me.
Please don't lose your faith in me.

Oh,Oh,oh....
I'm not going anywhere. [3x]

But, when I let you down, 
look past your doubt.
Just please, please, 
don't lose your faith in me.
Please don't lose your faith in me.

I'm not going anywhere.
