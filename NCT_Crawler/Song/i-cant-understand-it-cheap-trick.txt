                        Back against the wall but you know the
 Weekend's on it's way
 Waiting for the fall but you know the
 Weekend's on it's way I got my eyes on you
 I see some trouble comin' into view
 Don't you know that I'm doin' alright on my own? I can't understand it
 What's a matter with you
 I can't understand it
 What's a poor man to do Walking down the hall please stop in
 Anytime of day
 Let's do more than talk about the
 Weekend games we play I set my sights on you
 Let's make tonight a deep interview
 Don't you know that I'm doin' alright on my own? I can't understand it
 What's a matter with you
 I can't understand it
 What's a poor man to do I ain't out to destroy you
 I'm comin' out to enjoy you
 It's just a case of paranoia in my brain I've got my eyes on you
 I've got my gun loaded just for two
 If you knew my feelings I'm tellin' the truth I can't understand it
 What's a matter with you
 I can't understand it
 What's a poor man to do
