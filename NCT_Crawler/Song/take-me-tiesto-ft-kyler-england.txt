                        Waiting for the light to change from red
 Thinking over all the things you said to me
 You said to me
 All your dreams are dying in the sun
 Pretty soon there'll be nowhere left to run away
 To run away You packed your bags to leave by the morning
 Destination far off and foreign
 It's never or now
 It's never or now Baby won't you take me
 Baby won't you take me with you
 With you
 Baby won't you take me
 Baby won't you take me with you
 With you
 'Cause I don't wanna be alone tonight
 I don't wanna be alone tonight
 Baby won't you take me
 Baby won't you take me with you
 With you Memories of a life I leave behind
 Take a souvenir to remind me of
 The ones that love Feel my heart it beats like a stopwatch
 Running out of time with each tick tock
 It's never or now
 It's never or now Baby won't you take me
 Baby won't you take me with you
 With you
 Baby won't you take me
 Baby won't you take me with you
 With you
 'Cause I don't wanna be alone tonight
 I don't wanna be alone tonight
 Baby won't you take me
 Baby won't you take me with you
 With you Baby won't you take me
 Baby won't you take me with you
 With you
 Baby won't you take me
 Baby won't you take me with you
 With you
 'Cause I don't wanna be alone tonight
 I don't wanna be alone tonight
 Baby won't you take me
 Baby won't you take me with you
 With you
