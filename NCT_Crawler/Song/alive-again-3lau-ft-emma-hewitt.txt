                        Bài hát: Alive Again - 3LAU, Emma Hewitt

Always I’ve known that you were there
I only had to find out where
We have our own ways
Our own signs to follow
With different roads that lead us home

And I feel you close
I’m alive again
And it seems like home
This is where the rainbow ends

And I feel you close
This is where the rainbow ends
And it seems like home
This is where the rainbow ends
And I feel you close

Footsteps I follow to your door
We don’t need to talk anymore
We have the same heart
The same mind, the same souls
The distant lights will lead us on

I feel you close
I’m alive again
And it seems like home
This is where the rainbow ends
This is where we are now
This is where the rainbow ends

I feel you close
I’m alive again
And it seems like home
This is where the rainbow ends
                        
                    |
