                        Bài hát: If You're Hearing This - Hook N Sling, Parson James, Betty Who

We all wanna believe. 
Wanna believe in something, 'cause if we believe in nothing then what do we have, what do we have?
We all wanna be loved, all wanna love somebody 'cause if we ain't got nobody then what do we have, what do we have?

If you're hearing this, I'm at King and Fifth, 8 to 10 I'll sit at this table for two, in a Dodgers cap, drinking coffee black, wondering where you're at. 
I'll be waiting, be waiting for you.

I've been waiting, been waiting for you.

We all wanna believe.
Wanna believe in something, 'cause if we believe in nothing then what do we have, what do we have?
We all wanna be loved. All wanna love somebody 'cause if we ain't got nobody then what do we have, what do we have?

If you're hearing this, know I'm listening, I'm still wandering down these lost avenues. But I know one day clear blue skies are grey. I'll walk in and you'll say: "I've been waiting, been waiting for you."

I've been waiting, been waiting for you.

If you're hearing this, I'm at King and Fifth, 8 to 10 I'll sit at this table for two. But I know one day, clear blue skies are grey, I'll walk in and you'll say: "I've been waiting, been waiting for you."

I've been waiting, been waiting for you.

I've been waiting, been waiting for you.
