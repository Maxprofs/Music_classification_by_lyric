On her black satin sheets suedes and dark greens.

I let him know we bout that cake straight up the gate uh
We independent women, some mistake us for *s

Disagree? Well that's you and I'm sorry
Imma keep playing these cats out like Atari
wearing high heel shoes, getting love from the dudes
4 bad ass chicks from the Moulin Rouge

We drink wine with diamonds in the glass
by the case the meaning of expensive taste

Mocha Chocalate-a what?
Creole Lady Marmalade
One more time C'mon now

Marmalade... Lady Marmalade... Marmalade...
