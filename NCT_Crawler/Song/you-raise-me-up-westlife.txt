                        "when i am down 
and oh my soul so weary
when troubles come 
and my heart burdened be
then i am still
and wait here in the silence
until you come, and sit awhile with me
you raise me up 
so i can stand on mountanis
you raise me up, to walk on stormy seas
i am strong, when i am on your shoulders
you raise me up 
to more then i can be 
you raise me up 
so i can stang on mountains
you raise me up
to walk on stormy seas
i am strong 
when i am on your shoulders
you raise me up, to more then i can be
there is no life 
no life without its hunger
each restless heart
beats so imperfectly
but when you come 
i am felled with wonder
sometimes i think i glimpse eternity
(you raise me up so i can stand on mountanis)
i can stand on mountanis
(you raise me up, to walk on stromy seas)
and i am strong 
when i am on your shoulders 
you raise me up to more than i can be(x2)"
