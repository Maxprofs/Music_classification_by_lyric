                        Bài hát: Giai Điệu Bất Tận - Quang Thọ

Oh, my love, my darling 
Oh, my love, my darling, 
I've hungered for your touch 
a long, lonely time. 
And time goes by so slowly 
and time can do so much, 
are you still mine? 
I need your love, 
I need your love, 
God speed your love ..... to me! 

Lonely rivers flow 
to the sea, to the sea, 
To the open arms of the sea. 
Lonely rivers sigh, 
"Wait for me, wait for me!" 
I'll be coming home, wait for me! 

Oh, my love, my darling, 
I've hungered, for your touch 
a long, lonely time. 
And time goes by so slowly 
and time can do so much, 
are you still mine? 
I need your love 
I need your love, 
God speed your love...... to me! 

Additional verse: 
Lonely mountains gaze 
at the stars, at the stars, 
Waiting for the dawn of the day. 
All alone, I gaze 
at the stars, at the stars, 
Dreaming of my love far away. 

Oh, my love, my darling, 
I've hungered for your touch 
a long, lonely time. 
And time goes by so slowly 
and time can do so much, 
are you still mine? 
I need your love, 
I need your love, 
God speed your love to me!
