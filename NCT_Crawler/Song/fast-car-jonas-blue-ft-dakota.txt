                        Bài hát: Fast Car - Jonas Blue, Dakota


You got a fast car
I want a ticket to anywhere
Maybe we make a deal
Maybe together we can get somewhere
Any place is better
Starting from zero got nothing to lose
Maybe we'll make something
Me myself I got nothing to prove
You got a fast car

I got a plan to get us out of here
I been working at the convenience store
Managed to save just a little bit of money
Won't have to drive too far
Just 'cross the border and into the city
You and I can both get jobs
And finally see what it means to be living
You got a fast car

Is it fast enough so we can fly away?
We gotta make a decision
Leave tonight or live and die this way

So remember when we were driving driving in your car
Speed so fast I felt like I was drunk
City lights lay out before us
And your arm felt nice wrapped 'round my shoulder
And I had a feeling that I belonged
I had a feeling that I could be someone
Had a feeling that I could be someone
See my old man's got a problem
He live with the bottle that's the way it is
He says his body's too old for working
His body's too young to look like his

My mama went off and left him
She wanted more from life than he could give
I said somebody's got to take care of him
So I quit school and that's what I did
You got a fast car
We go cruising, entertain ourselves
You still ain't got a job
And I work in a market as a checkout girl

I know things will get better

You'll find work and I'll get promoted
We'll move out of the shelter
Buy a bigger house and live in the suburbs
You got a fast car

Is it fast enough so we can fly away?
You gotta make a decision
Leave tonight or live and die this way
So remember when we were driving driving in your car
Speed so fast I felt like I was drunk
City lights lay out before us
And your arm felt nice wrapped 'round my shoulder
And I had a feeling that I belonged
I had a feeling that I could be someone
Had a feeling that I could be someone
be someone
Had a feeling that I could be someone
