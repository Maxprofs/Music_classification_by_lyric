                        This love cannot be bought or sold
 It's timeless as a story often told
 Oh, and this love is never well behaved
 Makes me wanna testify
 Stand up, tell the world I'm saved Oh, daughters of Jerusalem
 I have seen the day break
 And the shadows flee away I'll break the chains of fear
 In the name of this love
 Laugh away the tears
 In the name of this love And this love, it doesn't bow its head
 It don't need anybody's blessing
 And don't care what anybody says, oh Oh, daughters of Jerusalem
 I have seen the day break
 And the shadows flee away I'll break the chains of fear
 In the name of this love
 Laugh away the tears
 In the name of this love Oh, daughters of Jerusalem
 I have seen the day break
 And the shadows flee away
 Ooh, ooh I'll break the chains of fear
 In the name of this love
 Laugh away the tears
 In the name of this love
 Name of this love
