                        In sleep he sang to me 
In dreams he came 
That voice which calls to me 
And speaks my name 

And do I dream again? 
For now I find 
The Phantom of the Opera is there 
Inside my mind 

Sing once again with me 
Our strange duet 
My power over you 
Grows stronger yet 

And though you turn from me 
To glance behind 
The Phantom of the Opera is there 
Inside your mind 


All those who've seen your face 
Draw back in fear 
I am the mask you wear 

It's me they hear 


Your/my spirit and my/your voice 
In one combined 
The Phantom of the Opera is there 
Inside my/your mind 


He's there, the Phantom of the Opera 
Beware, the Phantom of the Opera... 


In all your fantasies 
You always knew 
That man and mystery 


Were both in you 


And in this labyrinth 
Where night is blind 
The Phantom of the Opera is there 
Inside my/your mind 

Sing, my angel of music! 


He's there, the Phantom of the Opera 
Ah! 


Sing, my angel, sing! 


Ah! 


Sing for me! 


Ah! 

Sing, my angel of music! 


Ah!
