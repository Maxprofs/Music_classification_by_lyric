                        Bài hát : Officially Missing You (Studio Session) - Jayesslee

Hmm mmm 
Yeah...
All I hear is raindrops falling on the rooftop 
Ooh baby tell me why'd you have to go? 
'Cause this pain I feel it won't go away 
And today I'm officially missing you 
I thought that from this heartache I could escape 
But I fronted long enough to know 
There ain't no way and today 
I'm officially missing you 

Ooo can't nobody do it like you 
Said every little thing you do 
Hey baby say it, stays on my mind 
And I, I'm officially 
All I do is lay around, two ears full of tears 
From looking at your face on the wall,face on the wall 
Just a week ago you were my baby 
Now I don't even know you at all, I don't know you at all 

Well I wish that you could call me right now 
So that I could get through to you some how 
But I guess it's safe to say baby, safe to say 
That I'm, I'm officially missing you 

Ooo can't nobody do it like you 
Said every little thing you do 
Hey baby say it, stays on my mind 
And I, I'm officially 

Well I thought I could just get over you baby 
But I see that's something I just can't do 
From the way you would hold me 
To the sweet things you told me 
I just can't find a way to let go off you 
Ooo can't nobody do it like you 
Said every little thing you do 
Hey baby say it, stays on my mind 
And I, I'm offi ially 
It's official 
You know that I'm missing you 
Oh yea yes, all I hear is raindrops 
Ooh yea 
And I'm officially missing you
