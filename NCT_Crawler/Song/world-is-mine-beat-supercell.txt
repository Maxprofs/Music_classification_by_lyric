                        Bài hát: World Is Mine - Supercell, Hatsune Miku

Sekai de ichiban ohime-sama 
Sou iu atsukai kokoroete yo ne 

(The number one princess in the world 
Know how to treat me that way, okay?)

Sono ichi itsumo to chigau kamigata ni ki ga tsuku koto 
Sono ni chanto kutsu made miru koto ii ne? 
Sono san watashi no hitokoto ni wa mittsu no kotoba de henji suru koto 
Wakattara migite ga orusu nano wo nantoka shite! 

(First thing, notice when I have a different hair style from usual 
Second thing, be sure to go as far as looking down at my shoes properly, do I make myself clear? 
Third thing, for every single world I say, reply with three words 
If you understand that there is nothing in my right hand, then do something!)

Betsu ni wagamama nante itte nai n dakara 
KIMI ni kokoro kara omotte hoshii no kawaii tte 

(I'm not really saying anything selfish 
I want you to think from your heart that I'm cute)

Sekai de ichiban ohime-sama 
Ki ga tsuite nee nee 
Mataseru nante rongai yo 
Watashi wo dare dato omotteru no? 
Mou nanda ka amai mono ga tabetai! 
Ima sugu ni yo 

(The number one princess in the world 
Realize that, hey, hey 
Keeping me waiting is out of the question 
Who do you think I am? 
Somehow I would already like to eat something sweet! 
Go get it immediately)

Ketten? Kawaii no machigai desho 
Monku wa yurushimasen no 
Ano ne? Watashi no hanashi chanto kiiteru? Chotto... 
A, sore to ne? Shiroi ouma-san kimatteru desho? 
Mukae ni kite 
Wakattara kashizuite te wo totte "ohime-sama" tte 

(My fault? Let's call it a cute mistake 
Complaints are not permitted 
Well? Are you clearly hearing what I am saying? Come on 
Ah, and what about this? A white horse, isn't that needless to say? 
Come and take me away 
If you understand that, take my hand and say "Princess")

Betsu ni wagamama nante itte nai n dakara 
Demo ne sukoshi kurai shikatte kuretatte ii no yo?

(I'm not really saying anything selfish 
But you know, it's alright to scold me a little?)

Sekai de watashi dake no ouji-sama 
Ki ga tsuite hora hora 
Otete ga aitemasu 
Mukuchi de buaiso na ouji-sama 
Mou doushite! Ki ga tsuite yo hayaku 

(My very own prince in the world 
Realize that, look, look 
Our hands are empty 
World Is Mine lyrics on ***
Reticent and blunt prince 
Come one, why! Just notice it soon)

Zettai KIMI wa wakatte nai! Wakatte nai wa... 

(You definitely don't understand! Don't understand...)

Ichigo no notta SHOOTOKEEKI 
Kodawari tamago no torokeru PURIN 
Minna minna gaman shimasu... 
Wagamama na ko dato omowanai de 
Watashi datte yareba dekiru mon 
Ato de koukai suru wa yo 

(Shortcake with a strawberry placed on top 
Pudding made with well-selected eggs 
Everything, everything, I will hold myself back from it 
Don't think that I'm a selfish girl 
Even I will be able to do it if I try 
You will regret this afterwards)

Touzen desu! Datte watashi wa 

(It's natural! Even for me)

Sekai de ichiban ohime-sama 
Chanto mitete yo ne dokoka ni icchau yo? 
Fui ni dakishimerareta kyuu ni sonna e? 
"Hikareru abunai yo" Sou itte soppo muku KIMI 
...Kocchi no ga abunai wa yo 


(The number one princess in the world 
See me clearly okay, shall I go somewhere? 
Suddenly I was held tightly, it was so abrupt, eh?
"It's dangerous, you'll be hit" So saying that you turn away 
...I think this person is dangerous though)
                        
                    |
