                        Livin' in a cruel world
 Drudging with my feet in the snow
 On a day out
 And it turned night now
 Doctor, I've been walking on the side of the road, for a long time
 And I'm going out of my mind It's so far from me now, but oh I can hear the sounds
 It's so far from me now, but oh I can hear the sounds
 It's so far from me now, but oh I can hear the sounds
 It's so far from me now, but oh I can hear the sounds Can't you hear the bells singing along?
 You all hear it on the radio
 Can't you see the hero coming home?
 Can't you hear the bells Singing on the rooftop
 Crazy days are coming again
 I've been runnin'
 But I'll be hidden in the masquerade
 So far from me now, but oh I can hear the sounds
 It's so far from me now (oh I can hear the sounds) Can't you hear the bells singing along?
 You all hear it on the radio
 Can't you see the hero coming home?
 Can't you hear the bells? So far from me now, oh I can hear the sounds
 So far from me now, oh I can hear the sounds
 So far from me now, oh I can hear the sounds
 So far from me now, oh I can hear the sounds Can't you hear the bells singing along?
 You all hear it on the radio
 Can't you see the hero coming home?
 You all hear it on the radio
 Can't you hear the bells singing along?
 You all hear it on the radio
 Can't you see the hero coming home?
 Can't you hear the bells singing along?
