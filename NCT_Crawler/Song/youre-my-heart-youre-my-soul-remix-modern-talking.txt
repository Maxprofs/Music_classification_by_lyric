                        [VERSE 1]
Deep in my heart - there's a fire - a burning heart
Deep in my heart - there's desire - for a start
I'm dying in emotion
It's my world in fantasy
I'm living in my, living in my dreams.

[CHORUS]
You're my heart, you're my soul
I'll keep it shining everywhere I go
You're my heart, you're my soul
I'll be holding you forever
Stay with you together.
Your my heart, you're my soul
Yeah, I'm feeling that our love will grow.
You're my heart, you're my soul
That's the only thing I really know.

[VERSE 2]
Let's close the door and believe my burning heart
Feeling alright come on open up your heart
Keep the candles burning
Let your body melt in mine
I'm living in my, living in my dreams

[CHORUS] x 2
                        
                    |
