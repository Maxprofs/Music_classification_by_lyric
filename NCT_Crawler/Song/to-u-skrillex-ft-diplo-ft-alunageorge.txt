Believe me, I could live without you
But I really don't want to
Believe me, I could love without you
But I really don't need to

'Cause leavin' is the hardest thing to do
But being left is hard, oh yes, it's true
But you're coming back
How do I get back to you, to you, to you?

I cannot get back to you
Back to, get back to you

Leavin' is the hardest thing to do
But being left is hard, oh yes, it's true
But you're coming back
How do I get back to you, to you, to you?

Get back to you

'Cause leavin' is the hardest thing to do
But being left is hard, oh yes, it's true
But you're coming back
How do I get back to you, to you, to you?

I cannot get back to you
Back to, get back to you
Back to, get back to you

Well I don't wanna face it
All this time that I wasted
It's so close I can taste it

I cannot get back to you
I cannot get back to you
I cannot get back to you
I cannot get back to you
I cannot get back to you
I cannot get back to you
I cannot get back to you
I cannot get back to you

Leavin' is the hardest thing to do
But being left is hard, oh yes, it's true
