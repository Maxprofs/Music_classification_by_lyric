                        Yeahh. Ooh Yeahh.

 I'm like a sunday morning.
 Your like friday night.
 And when we kiss it's the perfect weekend,
 No rain in sight.
 And when I'm feelin incomplete your my missing piece.
 And when you need your breath taken away I'll be your thief.

 From the start to the end we don't need to pretend
 That were perfect all the time.
 Cuz we know what we have through the good and the bad
 It's the strength that you can't deny.

 I don't need to find a million reasons why
 This is us. This is us. And this is how we love.
 Some ways we're different but together we're so right.
 This is us. This is us. And this is how we love.

 Ooh Ah. Yeah.

 And even if we fall apart we'll never feel alone.
 Just like the moon starts risin' our hearts bring us home.
 We can always find eachoher like the northern star.
 Doesn't matter where we are our love can't go that far.

 From the start to the end we don't need to pretend
 That were perfect all the time.
 Cuz we know what we have through the good and the bad
 It's the strength that you can't deny.

 I don't need to find a million reasons why
 This is us. This is us. And this is how we love.
 Some ways we're different but together we're so right.
 This is us. This is us. And that's the way we love.

 We don't always see eye to eye.
 You might see a million colors.
 I just see it black and white.
 Aint no way we could get much higher
 Cuz when we touch it feels like fire
 We both know how good this feels.

 Yes we do baby because
 This is you. This is me. This is us.

 I don't need to find a million reasons why
 This is us. This is us. And this is how we love.
 Some ways were different but together we're so right.
 This is us. This is us. And this is how we love.

 Baby. This is how we love. This is us. This is us. Oooh.

 This is how we love. Yeahh.
