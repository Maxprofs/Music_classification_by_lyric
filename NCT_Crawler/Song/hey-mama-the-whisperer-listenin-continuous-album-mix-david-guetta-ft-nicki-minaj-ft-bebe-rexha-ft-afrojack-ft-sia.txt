Yes I'll be your woman
Yes I'll be your baby
Yes I'll be whatever that you tell me when you're ready
Yes I'll be your girl
forever your lady
You ain't ever gotta worry
I'm down for you baby
Best believe that
when you need that
I'll provide that
you will always have it
I'll be on deck
keep it in check
When you need that
I'm a let you have it
