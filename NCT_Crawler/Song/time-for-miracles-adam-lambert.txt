Time For Miracles
Adam Lambert

It's late at night and I can't sleep
Missing you just runs too deep
Oh I can't breathe thinking of your smile

Every kiss I can't forget
This aching heart ain't broken yet
Oh God I wish I could make you see

'Cos I know this flame isn't dying
So nothing can stop me from trying

Baby you know that maybe it's time for miracles
'Cos I ain't giving up on love
You know that maybe it's time for miracles
'Cos I ain't giving up on love
No I ain't giving up on us

I just wanna be with you
'Cos living is so hard to do
When all I know is trapped inside your eyes

The future I cannot forget
This aching heart ain't broken yet
Oh God I wish I could make you see

'Cos I know this flame isn't dying
So nothing can stop me from trying

Baby you know that maybe it's time for miracles
'Cos I ain't giving up on love
You know that maybe it's time for miracles
'Cos I ain't giving up on love
No I ain't giving up on us

Baby can you feel it coming?
You know I can hear it, hear it, the souls
Baby, you feel, they feel you
You know it's time

Baby, maybe it's time for miracles
'Cos I ain't giving up on love
You know that maybe it's time for miracles
'Cos I ain't giving up on love
You know maybe it's time for miracles
'Cos I ain't giving up on love
No I ain't giving up on us
I ain't giving up...
No. No I ain't giving up on us
