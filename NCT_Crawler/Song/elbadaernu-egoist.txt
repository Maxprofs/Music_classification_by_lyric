                        Its swallowed up in the dark dark dark
You are swallowed up
that love that hate that past that pain
and you know yourself

I found between 0 and 1
Thats my name its lost in everything
but you know
You understand my feeling
Tatoeba boku ga kiminara 
Kitto konna fuuni
I said its not that I love you
but you love me because I love you

Its swallowed up in the dark dark dark
You are swallowed up
that love that hate that past that pain
and you know yourself 
yourself

Kore wa dare no kaoda?
Boku no katachi wa marude futashikade utagawashikute 
Yappa boku ga kimi 
Demo kitto konna fuuni
I said its not that I need you
but you need me because I need you

Its swallowed up in the dark dark dark
You are swallowed up
that love that hate that past that pain
and you know yourself 
yourself.
