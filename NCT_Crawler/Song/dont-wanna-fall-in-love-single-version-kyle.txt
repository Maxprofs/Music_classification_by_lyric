                        Bài hát: Don't Wanna Fall In Love (Single Version) - Kyle

What's up!
Aww dammit baby you bad
Yeah yeah yeah, heard you got a boyfriend
That's cool girl where is he at?
Oh he *** up
You lucked up
You done ran into the mutha***ing man
I'm gonna make you my bae for a day
He should be happy I'm giving you back
Cause I can make you wifey for a week
We can spend a weekend in Japan
If anyone *** with my akachan
Tell em' they'll get ***ing Jackie Chan-ed
Honestly I'm better as your boy
I'd be kinda ***ty as your man
Let's go back to only being friends
Sorry girl I hope you understand

[Hook x2:]
(It's just)
I don't want to fall in love
(Nope)
Love cuts just like a knife
(That's right)
You make the knife feel good
(So good, So good)
I’ll fight you till the end

I wasn't leading you on girl
I just forgot where I was going
I got way too attached
That wasn't the plan
And I knew a girl just like you once
We ended up hating each other
Cause we couldn't let it end
That can’t happen again, no

[Hook x2:]
(It's just)
I don't want to fall in love
(Nope)
Love cuts just like a knife
(That's right)
You make the knife feel good
(So good, So good)
I’ll fight you till the end

Someone put em up ding-ding-ding
Pulling my heart strings zing-zing-zing
But I’m trying to let go
But its hard enough to leave you alone with the phone going ring ring ring
Please let me go
Cause I don’t want to fall in love
Cause the last time left me cold
When she left my house she didn’t even let me know
Nigga she ain’t even leave me notes
Part of the reason I’m easily hurt
Part of the reason I’m leaving you first
Pardon that, part of me give my apologies
I know that working on it never works
I’m sorry it’s you but hey what should I do?
Be happy with lies? Or be sad with the truth?
Don’t be ashamed you see love is a game and I still want to play
I’m just too scared to lose and I know you are too

[Hook x4:]
I don’t wanna fall in love
(But it's good, you know?)
Love cuts just like a knife
(I mean were young we don't need to be all tied down)
You make the knife feel good
(Honestly *** this ***, let's just boogie, alright?)
I’ll fight you till the end
