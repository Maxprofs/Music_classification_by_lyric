                        Bài hát: Jaywalk - Trọng Hiếu Idol

There's something on my mind
That's on the other side
The grass is greener all the time
She's just so beautiful
It's all I'm thinking of

Oh what a sweet voice 
I'm feeling love I'll tell ya
The warning signs won't turn us off
We meet every day at the same cafe
And we don't know we'll be there

And it feels so wrong but its way too strong to let go
So we'll go again
So many times we cross the line
Don't mind the red light we'll be fine
Yea we jaywalk

Yea we jaywalk
Ooh ooh ooh oh yeah ooh ooh ooh we don't care
Yea we jaywalk
Yea we jaywalk
Some roads are dangerous

But it ain't stopping us
Until we fall like dominos
I know we shouldn't do it
They're gonna say we lose it
Whatever left then track the score

I'll tell ya
Tomorrow i'll be back for more
We meet everyday at the same cafe
And we don't know we'll be there
And it feels so wrong but it's way too strong to let go

So we'll go again
So many times we cross the line
Don't mind the red light we'll be fine
Yea we jaywalk
Yea we jaywalk

Ooh ooh ooh oh yeah ooh ooh ooh we don't care
Yea we jaywalk
Yea we jaywalk
We cant let go
And we both know

The harder we try, the less we can say goodbye
We meet everyday at the same cafe
And we don't know we'll be there
And it feels so wrong but it's way too strong to let go
So we'll go again

So many times we cross the line
Don't mind the red light we'll be fine
Yea we jaywalk
Yea we jaywalk
Ooh ooh ooh oh yeah ooh ooh ooh we don't care
Yea we jaywalk
Yea we jaywalk
