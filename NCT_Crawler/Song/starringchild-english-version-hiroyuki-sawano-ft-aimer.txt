                        Bài hát: StarRingChild (English Version) - Hiroyuki Sawano, Aimer

Thinkin about the moment while we'd strayed 
from the right path 
We've might misplaced the seed of smile 
but we were not spontaneous 

There's a lump in my throat 
I ain't ready to recover it was too young to grasp 
I thought it must be no business of mine 
They ought to try rewriting our life like as 
she has been done 

We've struggled to break loose 
from this metempsychosis 
Got mature too much to hear 
our voice within 

Star・Ring・Child 
Give me your hands to see what noble galaxy 
That we've been fighting for 
I'm by your side, I'll give you all of me 
To track who we used to be 
While the stars sync with my heart beat 
The story will go on 

I'm gonna lose my reasons 
while I'd sink in deep complacence 
Without your hope, 
I can't reboot from myself in repentance 

My body's hurt and shaking 
Even now while we are in freedom 
I receive the truth whenever 
I catch your footsteps and rhythm 
We survive and stand on here 
at the huge sacrifice of their life 

We've struggled to break loose 
from this metempsychosis 
But we'd chosen then to play 
out such a roll 

When the sun hides in the cosmic clouds 
Under the dark night shroud , the silence will wraple us 
You're by my side, You share the fate with me 
I could let my heart be free 
Now, I'll wake from my delusion 

Star・Ring・Child 
Give me your hands to see what noble galaxy 
That we've been fighting for 
I'm by your side, I'll give you all of me 
To track who we used to be 
While the stars sync with my heart beat 
The story will go on 

Soar beyond the noise, we'll live in harmony 
And strive against the destiny 
We're charging up enough to make our brand new flow 
Standing back now from all sorts of agony 
There's no meaning to seek any reason 
Everything starts off in a second 

Right behind the worst 
The daybreak was reserved 
For the people who're confined 
We're charging up enough to make our brand new flow 

Standing back now from all sorts of agony 
There's no meaning to seek any reason 
Everything starts shining 
so bright to draw the new age
                        
                    |
