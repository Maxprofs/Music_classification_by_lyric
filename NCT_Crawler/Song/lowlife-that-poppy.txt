                        Bài hát: Lowlife - That Poppy

[Verse 1]
Old suitcase, clean getaway
I'm the one who takes the blame again
New day but the same lines
I feel like the victim of the dollar sign

[Pre-Chorus]
All these years on my own
Fight my fight all alone
Till you came, don't you know
Don't you know

[Chorus]
Baby you're the highlight of my lowlife
Take a shitty day and make it alright
Oh and every circumstance
Yeah you make the difference
Baby you're the highlight of my lowlife (lowlife)

[Verse 2]
This bad taste, these headaches
Wake up on the floor again, oh yeah
My torn dress, these fail tests
Soon they will be erased

[Pre-Chorus]
All these years on my own
Fight my fight all alone
Till you came, don't you know
Don't you know

[Chorus]
Baby you're the highlight of my lowlife
Take a shitty day and make it alright
Oh and every circumstance
Yeah you make the difference
Baby you're the highlight of my lowlife (lowlife)

[Bridge]
And I get so lonely
I can't make it on my own
And I need to call you
"Can you come to my chateau?"
Take me in your arms and
Hold me tight yeah pull me close
Whisper in my ear
All I want you to say is

[Chorus] x2
Baby you're the highlight of my lowlife
Take a shitty day and make it alright
Oh and every circumstance
Yeah you make the difference
Baby you're the highlight of my lowlife (lowlife)
                        
                    |
