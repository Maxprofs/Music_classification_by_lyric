                        [Chorus]
I wish upon a star
Wanna be right where you are
You set my world on fire
Babe I got a crush on you
I wish upon a star
Can't you see how right we are
We should be together
Babe I got a crush on you

I used to turn around and walk away
Never stopped to play
Cause there was no attraction

But in my heart you start to grow on me
Kind of suddenly
So now I've changed direction

Knowing it might seems strange
Love came over me
Feeling the luck has changed
Do you want me, like I want you?

[Chorus]

In this cold world, where dreams are few
Baby, I want you
Is it too much to ask for?

I'll take you places where you never been
If you just give in
So babe, it's now or never

Knowing it might seems strange...
Love came over me
Feeling the luck has changed
Do you want me, like I want you?

[Chorus]

Me and you, you and me. Living a life in harmony
Oh It's magic magic magic babe I've got a crush on you

Me and you, you and me. Living a life in harmony
It's magic magic cos babe I've got a crush on you

So if you feel the way I do
Would you fancy to
To take a ride beside me?

Me and you, you and me. Living a life in harmony
It's magic(oh it's magic) babe I've got a crush on you [x2]

[Chorus]

I wish upon a star
Wanna be right where you are
You set my world on fire
Babe I got a crush on you
                        
                    |
