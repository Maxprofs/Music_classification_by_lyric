                        [Verse:]
 See, first of all
 I know these so-called playas wouldn't tell you this
 But *I'ma be real and say what's on my heart
 Let's take this chance and make this love feel relevant
 Didn't you know I loved you from the start, yeah...
 When I think about
 All these years we've put in this relationship
 Who knew we'd make it this far
 Then I think about
 Where would I be if we were to just to fall apart
 And I can't stand the thought of losing you

 [Chorus:]
 Meet me at the altar in your white dress
 We ain't getting no younger, we might as well do it
 Been feeling you all the while, girl, I must confess
 Girl, let's just get married
 I just wanna get married
 Meet me at the altar in your white dress
 We ain't getting no younger, we might as well do it
 Been feeling you all the while, girl, I must confess
 Let's get married

 [Verse 2:]
 Said I done it all
 But frankly, girl, I'm tired of this emptiness
 I wanna come home to you and only you
 'Cause making love to just anyone ain't happening
 I just gotta be with you
 Do you think about
 Us finishing something we started so long ago
 I wanna give you my all...
 Do you think about
 Maybe us having some babies
 Come on won't you be my lady forever, yeah...

 [Bridge:]
 I'm ready to commit to you
 And I just can't wait for that night
 'Cause I need you here with me
 And let's start a family
 Oh...

 (Chorus/Vamp till End)

 *I'ma / I'mma / I'm a ---> I'm going to / I'm
                        
                    |
