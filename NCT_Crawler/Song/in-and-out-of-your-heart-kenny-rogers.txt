                        If my hearts not too late
 For a piece of your time
 Theres been so many days
 Since your eyes looked at mine In the dark of this room
 Where the burning has grown
 You believe in your love
 When youre lost and alone And life dont give no reasons
 When the love goes away
 No answers for someone like you Hold me, hold me
 Seems like we never get together anymore
 Hold me, hold me
 Starry nights dont come enough
 Thats what we come here for, hold me I will lay by your side
 I can warm your cold nights
 You can play in my dreams
 Till Im out of your sight in the morning, my love Couldnt change where you go
 You were always my woman
 Its the one truth I know
 So hold out when theres no chance
 For your love anyway
 No diamond could shine close to you Hold me, hold me
 Seems like we never get together anymore
 Hold me, hold me
 Starry nights dont come enough
 Thats what we came here for, hold me
                        
                    |
