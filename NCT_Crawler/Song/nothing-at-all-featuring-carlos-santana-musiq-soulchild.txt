                        Bài hát: Nothing At All (featuring Carlos Santana) - Musiq Soulchild

I am a victim of my time
A produce of my age
There's no choosing my direction
I was a holy man but now
With all my trials behind me
I am weak in my conviction

And so I walk to try to get away
Knowing that someday I will finally have to face
The fear that will come from knowing that
The one thing I had left was you
And now you're gone

You were a victim of my crimes
A product of my rage
You were a beautiful distraction
I kept you locked away outside
Let misery provide
And now I am ashamed

And so I walk to try to find a space
Where I can be alone to live with my mistakes
And the fear that will come
From knowing that the one thing
I had left was you
And now you're gone

[Chorus:]
Is there nothing at all
That i can do to turn your hert
Is there nothing to lean on
That could help erase the scars
Te quiero - me quiero
And I could use a little strength before I fall
Is there nothing at all

I am victim of my time
A product of the age
You alone are my obsession
You were the one I left behind
You've been heavy on my mind
It's been a lonely road I've traveled

And so I walk to try to get away
Knowing that someday I will finally have to face
The fear that will come from knowing that
The one thing I had left was you
And now you're gone

[Chorus:]
Is there nothing at all
That I can do to turn your heart
Is there nothing to lean on
Tha cold help erase the scars
Te quiero - me quiero
And I could use a little strength before I fall
Is there nothing at all
                        
                    |
