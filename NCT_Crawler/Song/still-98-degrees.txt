                        Title: 98 Degrees - Still lyrics

Artist: 98 Degrees Lyrics




Love
I see forever in your eyes
I can see heaven in your smile
And when I hold you close
I don't wanna let go
Because deep in my soul I know
Girl
That you are the only light I see
Your love means everything to me
I know that we will never part
'Cause you'll always be near
Here in my heart


If the sun should refuse to rise
And the moon doesn't hang in the night
The tides won't change
Seasons rearrange
When the world is through
I will still love you


Girl
You're like an angel from above
Sent here to shower me with your love
Hold me beneath your wings
Tell me all of those things
All the hopes and the dreams we can share
'Cause I'll be your shelter from the storm
I'll be the fire that keeps you warm
I'll be your light in the dark
'Cause you'll always be here in my heart
Oooh girl


If the sun should refuse to rise
And the moon doesn't hang in the night
The tides won't change
Seasons rearrange
When the world is through
I will still love you


If anything could last forever
It's what I feel for you
(That's what I feel for you)
You touch my heart in ways
That words could never say
That's why I'll always love you


If the sun should refuse to rise
And the moon doesn't hang in the night
The tides won't change
Seasons rearrange
When the world is through
I will still


If the sun should refuse to rise
And the moon doesn't hang in the night
The tides won't change
Seasons rearrange
When the world is through
I will still love you


I will still love you
                        
                    |
