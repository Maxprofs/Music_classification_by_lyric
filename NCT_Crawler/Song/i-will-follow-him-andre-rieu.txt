                        Bài hát: I Will Follow Him - André Rieu

I will follow Him 
Follow Him where ever he may go 
And near Him I always will be 
For nothing can keep me away 
He is my destiny 

I will follow 
Him Ever since he touched my heart, I knew 
There isn't an ocean too deep 
A mountain so high it can keep 
Keep me away, away from his love 

I love Him, I love Him, I love Him 
And where He goes I'll follow, I'll follow, I'll follow 
I will follow Him, follow Him where ever he may go 
There isn't an ocean too deep 
A mountain so high it can keep, keep me away 

We will follow Him Follow Him where ever he may go 
There isn't an ocean too deep 
A mountain so high it can keep Keep us away, away from His love 

(I love Him) 
Oh yes, I love Him 
(I'll follow) 
I'm gonna follow 
True love, he'll always be my true love 
(Forever) 
From now until forever 

I love Him, I love Him, I love Him 
And where He goes I'll follow, I'll follow, I'll follow 
He'll always be my true love, my true love, my true love 
From now until forever, forever, forever 
There isn't an ocean too deep 
A mountain so high it can keep 
Keep us away, away from his love
                        
                    |
