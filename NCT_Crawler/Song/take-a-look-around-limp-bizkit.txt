                        All attention in the world today
All the little girls fillin' up the world today
When the good comes to bad, the bad comes to good
But I'ma live my life like I should
(Like I should)

Now all the critics wanna hit it
*** can, now we did it
Just because they don't get it
But I'll stay fitted
New era committed
Now this red cap
Gets a rap from his critics

Do we always gotta cry?
(Always gotta cry?)
Do we always gotta be inside a lie?
(Live inside a lie)
Life is just a blast movin' very fast
(Blast, blast, blast, blast)
Better stay on top or life will kick you in the ass

Follow me into a solo
Remember that, kid
So what you wanna do?
And where you gonna run?
When you starin' down a cable
Of a mic pointed, that you grill like a gun

Limp Bizkit is rocking the set
It's like Russian roulette
When you're placin' your bet
So don't be upset
When you're broke
And you're done
'Cause I'ma be the one
Till I jet
(I'ma be the one till I jet)

I know why you wanna hate me
(Why you wanna hate me)
I know why you wanna hate me
(Why you wanna hate me)
I know why you wanna hate me
(Why you wanna hate me)
'Cause hate is all the world has even seen lately

I know why you wanna hate me
(Why you wanna hate me)
I know why you wanna hate me
(Why you wanna hate me)
Now I know why you wanna hate me
(Why you wanna hate me?)
'Cause hate is all the world has even seen lately

Why you wanna hate me?
'Cause hate is all the world has seen, has seen lately
And now you wanna hate me
'Cause hate is all the world has seen, has seen lately

Does anybody really know the secret?
Or the combination for this life and where they keep it?
It's kinda sad when you don't know the meanin'
But everything happens for a reason
(Everything happens for a reason)

I don't even know what I should say
'Cause I'm an idiot a loser, microphone abuser
I analyze every second I exist
Beatin' up my mind every second with my fist

And everybody wanna run
(Wanna run)
Everybody wanna hide from the gun
(Hide from the gun)
You can take that ride through this life if you want
But you can't take that edge off that knife
(No sir)

And now you want your money back
(Your money back)
But you're denied 'cause your brain's fried from the sac
And there ain't nothing I can do
'Cause life is a lesson, you'll learn it when you're through

I know why you wanna hate me
(Why you wanna hate me?)
I know why you wanna hate me
(Why you wanna hate me?)
I know why you wanna hate me
(Why you wanna hate me?)
'Cause hate is all the world has even seen lately

I know why you wanna hate me
(You wanna hate me)
I know why you wanna hate me
(You wanna hate me)
Now I know why you wanna hate me
'Cause hate is all the world has seen, has seen lately

Why you wanna hate me?
'Cause hate is all the world has seen, has seen lately
Now you wanna hate me
'Cause hate is all the world has seen, has seen lately

Now I know why
Now I know why
Now I know why

Now I know why you wanna hate me?
Now I know why you wanna hate me?
Now I know why you wanna hate me?

'Cause hate is all the world has seen, has seen lately
'Cause hate is all the world has seen, has seen lately
'Cause hate is all the world has seen, has seen lately
