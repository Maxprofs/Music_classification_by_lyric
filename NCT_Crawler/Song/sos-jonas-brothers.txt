I told you I made dinner plans
for you and and me and no one else
that don't include your crazy friends
well I'm done
with awkward situations empty
conversations

oooh, this is an S.O.S
don't want a second guess
this is the bottom line
it's true
I gave my all for you
now my heart's in two
and I can't find the other half
its like im walking on broken glass
better believe I bled
its a call I'll never get

So this is where the story ends
a conversation on I.M.
well I'm done
with texting
sorry for the miscommunication

oooh, this is an S.O.S
don't want a second guess
this is the bottom line
it's true
I gave my all for you
now my heart's in two
and I can't find the other half
its like im walking on broken glass
better believe I bled
its a call I'll never get

Next time I see you
giv'n you a high five
cuz hugs are overated
just FYI

oooh, this is an S.O.S
don't want a second guess
this is the bottom line
it's true
I gave my all for you
now my heart's in two

Yeah!

ooh, this is an S.O.S
don't want a second guess
this is the bottom line
it's true
I gave my all for you
now my heart's in two
and I can't find the other half
its like im walking on broken glass
better believe I bled
its a call I'll never get
call I'll never get
call I'll never get
