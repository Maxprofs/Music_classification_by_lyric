                        Bài hát: Animal - Nightcore

Baby I'm preying on you tonight
Hunt you down, eat you alive
Just like animals, animals, like animals
Maybe you think you that can hide
I can smell your scent for miles
Just like animals, animals, like animals
Baby I'm

So what you trying to do to me
It's like we can't stop, we're enemies
But we get along when I'm inside you
You're like a drug that's killing me
I cut you out entirely
But I get so high when I'm inside you
Yeah you can start over

You can run free
You can find other fish in the sea
You can pretend it's meant to be
But you can't stay away from me
I can still hear you making that sound
Taking me down, oh, under the ground
You can pretend it was me below
Baby I'm preying on you tonight
Hunt you down, eat you alive

Just like animals, animals, like animals
Maybe you think you that can hide
I can smell your scent for miles
Just like animals, animals, like animals
Baby I'm
So if I run, it's not enough
You're still in my head, forever stuck
But you can do, what you wanna do
I love your lies, I'll eat 'em up
But don't deny the animal

That comes alive when I'm inside you
Yeah you can start over
You can run free
You can find other fish in the sea
You can pretend it's meant to be
But you can't stay away from me
I can still hear you making that sound
Taking me down, oh, under the ground

You can pretend it was me below
Baby I'm preying on you tonight
Hunt you down, eat you alive
Just like animals, animals, like animals
Maybe you think you that can hide
I can smell your scent for miles
Just like animals, animals, like animals

Baby I'm
Don't tell no lie
You can't deny
The best inside
Yeah yeah yeah
Now girl don't lie
You can't deny
The best inside

Yeah yeah yeah
Just like animals, animals, like animals
Just like animals, animals, like animals
Baby I'm preying on you tonight
Hunt you down, eat you alive
Just like animals, animals, like animals

Maybe you think you that can hide
I can smell your scent for miles
Just like animals, animals, like animals
Baby I'm
Don't tell no lie
You can't deny
The beast inside

Yeah yeah yeah
Now girl don't lie
You can't deny
The beast inside
Yeah yeah yeah
