                        I really can't stay
Baby, it's cold outside
I've got to go away
Baby, it's cold outside
This evening has been
Was hoping that you'd drop in
So very nice
I'll hold your hands, they're just like ice
My mother will start to worry
Beautiful what's the hurry
My father will be pacing the floor
Listen to the fire place roar
So really I'd better scurry
Beautiful please don't hurry
Well maybe just half a drink more
Put some records on while I pour
The neighbors might think
Baby, it's bad out there
Say what's in this drink?
No haps to be had out there
I wish I knew how
Your eyes are like starlight now
To break the spell
I'll take your hat, your hair looks swell
I ought to say no no no sir
Mind if I move in closer?
At least I'm gonna say that I tried
What the sense of hurting my pride?
I really can't say
Baby, don't hold out
Babe but it's cold outside

I simply must go
But, baby, it's cold outside
The answer is no
But, baby, it's cold outside
This welcome has been
How lucky that you dropped in
So nice and warm
Look out the window at that storm
My sister will be suspicious
Gosh your lips look delicious
My brother will be there at the door
Waves upon a tropical shore
My maiden aunt's mind is vicious
Ooh your lips are delicious
But maybe a cigarette more
Never such a blizzard before
I've got to get home
But, baby, you'll freeze out there
Say, lend me a coat?
it's up to your knees out there
You've really been nice
I'm thrilled when you touch my hair
But don't you see
How can you do this thing to me?
There's bound to be talk tomorrow
Think of my lifelong sorrow
At least it will be plenty implied
If you've got it hold your head high
I really can't stay
Get over that hold out

Oh, baby, it's cold outside
                        
                    |
