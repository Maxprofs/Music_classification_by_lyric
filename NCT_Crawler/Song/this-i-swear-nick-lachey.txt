                        Bài hát: This I Swear - Nick Lachey

You're there by my side
Everywhere
I know that you will not forsake me
I give you my life
Would not think twice
Your love is all I need, believe me

I may not say it quite as much as I should
But when I say I love you darlin' that means for good
So open up your heart and let me in

And I will love you, till forever
Until death do us part we'll be together
So take my hand, and hold on tight
And we'll get there
And this I swear

I'm wonderin' how
I ever got by
Without you in my life to guide me
Wherever I go
The one thing that's true
Is everything I do I do for you

I may not say it half as much as I should
When I say I love you darlin' that means for good
So open up your heart and let me in

And I will love you, till forever
Until death do us part we'll be together
So take my hand, and hold on tight
And we'll get there
This I swear

So whenever you get weary
Just reach out for me
I'll never let you down, my love

And I will love you, until forever
Until death do us part we'll be together
So take my hand, and hold on tight
We'll get there

And I will love you, until forever
Until death do us part we'll be together
So take my hand, and hold on tight
And we'll get there, ooh we'll get there
This I swear
                        
                    |
