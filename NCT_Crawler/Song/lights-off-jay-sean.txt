                        I'm sick and tired of being sick and tired
It's you that I'm missing
It's like my brain is wired up
And there's a glitch in my system

You're like a drug
And now my blood won't stop itching
I'm in critical condition
Someone let me out of this prison

It's like my mind is playing tricks on me lately
I could've sworn that you are still my baby
I'm on a merry-go-round, going around
Driving me crazy

That's why it feels like
Losing you is like somebody
Just turned all the lights off
Won't somebody, anybody
Please just turn the lights on?

I won't take one step
I can't see what's coming next
Losing you is like somebody
Just turned all the lights off

Can't see at all, at all, at all
Can't see at all, no, oh no
Can't see at all, at all
'Cause it's like somebody
Just turned all the lights off

I don't understand how one minute
I just had it all now
I can't reach you 'cause I'm tied up
With this straight jacket on

I can't breathe, breathe, breathe
Breathe, breathe, breathe
I can't see, see, see
See, see, see, see, see

It's like my mind is playing tricks on me lately
I could've sworn that you are still my baby
I'm on a merry-go-round, going around
Driving me crazy

That's why it feels like
Losing you is like somebody
Just turned all the lights off
Won't somebody, anybody
Please just turn the lights on?

I won't take one step
I can't see what's coming next
Losing you is like somebody
Just turned all the lights off

I can't see at all, at all, at all
Can't see at all, no, oh no
Can't see at all, at all
'Cause it's like somebody
Just turned all the lights off

Used to see my world in color, girl
When you left me it's like my world turned gray
Turn my winter into summer, girl
Why won't you help me turn night to day?

I can't eat, I can't sleep, I can't think at all
Honestly it feels like I ain't living no more
Can't say no more, can't see no more

Baby, that's why it feels like
Losing you is like somebody
Just turned all the lights off
Won't somebody, anybody
Please just turn the lights on?

I won't take one step
I can't see what's coming next
Losing you is like somebody
Just turned all the lights off

Can't see at all, at all, at all, at all
Can't see at all, no, oh no
Can't see at all, at all
'Cause it's like somebody
Just turned all the lights off
