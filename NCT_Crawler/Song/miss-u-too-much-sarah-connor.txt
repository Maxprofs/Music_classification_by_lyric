                        The river's rotten and dry
A forest losing leaves 
And there's no ending
No use pretending
A girl feels lost inside
And all she ever wants is your affection
What would you do when
I take all my senses
And I lay them at your feet

[Chorus]
'Coz I don't need my eyes
If they can't see you
And I don't need my hands
If we can't touch
No I don't need my lips
If they can't kiss you baby
They're only showing me
What I don't wanna see
They only tell me that I miss you too much

Oh I miss you too much

We had a promise made
A vow too strong to break
We'd stay together
At least forever

But here's what I gotta learn
To wait till you return
Became my mission
So please forgive me
If I sacrifice my senses for a little bit of your love

[Chorus]

Too bad, too long, too strong
To keep holding on
Too far away
How long has this been going on
I know someday I'll find you somewhere
You'll take me in your arms to set me free
Oh yeah

[Chorus]

They just tell me that I miss you too much
Oh no
I miss you too much
                        
                    |
