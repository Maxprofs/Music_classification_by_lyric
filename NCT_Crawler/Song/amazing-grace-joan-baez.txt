                        Amazing Grace, how sweet the sound
 That saved a wretch like me
 I once was lost but now Im found
 I was blind but now I see It was Grace that taught my heart to fear
 And Grace my fears relieved
 How precious did that Grace appear
 The hour I first believed Amazing Grace, how sweet the sound
 That saved a wretch like me
 I once was lost but now Im found
 I was blind but now I see
