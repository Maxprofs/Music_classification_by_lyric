                        [Pitbull - Intro]

Me not working hard?
Yea right picture that with a kodak
And better yet, go to times square
Take a picture of me with a kodak
Took my life from negative to positive
And I just want y'all know that
And tonight, let's enjoy life

Pitbull, Nayer, Ne-Yo

[Ne-Yo / Nayer - Chorus]

Tonight I will love love you tonight
Give me everything tonight
For all we know we might not get tomorrow
Let's do it tonight
I will love love you tonight
Give me everything tonight
For all we know we might not get tomorrow
Lets do it tonight

Don’t care what they say
All the games they play
Nothing is enough
Till they handle love (Lets do it tonight)
I want you tonight, I want you today
I want you tonight

Grab somebody sexy tell ‘em hey
Give me everything tonight
Give me everything tonight
Give me everything tonight
Give me everything tonight

[Pitbull - Verse 1]

Get busy tonight
Cuz to more and more to do bad before and for Prius
Desperate tonight
I can make you my queen
And make love to you eanless
This is insane, the way the name growin’, money keep flowin’
Hustlers move aside, so I’m tiptoein, keep flowin’
I gotta locked up like Lindsay Lohan

Put it on my life baby
I can make you feel right baby
I can’t promise tomorrow
But I promise tonight

Dale

[Pitbull - Pre Chorus]

Excuse me
But I might drink a little bit more than I should tonight
And I might take you home with me if I could tonight
And I think you should let me cause I look good tonight
And we might not get tomorrow

[Ne-Yo / Nayer - Chorus]

Tonight I will love love you tonight
Give me everything tonight
For all we know we might not get tomorrow
Lets do it tonight
I will love love you tonight
Give me everything tonight
For all we know we might not get tomorrow

Lets do it tonight
Lets do it tonight

Don’t care what they say
All the games they play
Nothing is enough
Till they handle love (Lets do it tonight)
I want you tonight, I want you today
I want you tonight

Grab somebody sexy tell ‘em hey
Give me everything tonight
Give me everything tonight
Give me everything tonight
Give me everything tonight

Grab somebody sexy tell ‘em hey
Give me everything tonight
Give me everything tonight
Give me everything tonight
Give me everything tonight

[Pitbull - Verse 2]

Reach for the stars
And if you don’t grab em, at least you’re on top of the world
Think about it
Cuz if you slip I’m gonna fall on top of you girl
Put on ‘em ball when they sleep at the Macy’s
And it ain’t no secret
My granny’s from Cuba but I’m an American
Tied over money like Seacrest

Put it on my life baby
I can make you feel right baby
I can’t promise tomorrow
But I promise tonight

Dale

[Pitbull - Pre Chorus]

Excuse me
But I might drink a little bit more than I should tonight
And I might take you home with me if I could tonight
And I think you should let me cause I look good tonight
And we might not get tomorrow

[Ne-Yo / Nayer - Chorus]

Tonight I will love love you tonight
Give me everything tonight
For all we know we might not get tomorrow
Let's do it tonight
I will love love you tonight
Give me everything tonight
For all we know we might not get tomorrow
Lets do it tonight

Don’t care what they say
All the games they play
Nothing is enough
Till they handle love (Lets do it tonight)
I want you tonight, I want you today
I want you toni
