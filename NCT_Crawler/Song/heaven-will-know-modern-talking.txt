                        HEAVEN WILL KNOW 

( MODERN TALKING ) 

When I'm down feeling blue 
I close my eyes oh just to be with you 
I'm a dreamer and you know 
You're my woman and I'll never go 
God put an angel here on earth 
Who gave me more than all I'm worth 
You're my angel in the night 
In the darkness you're the light 

Heaven will know 
Oh heaven will know 
My love will grow baby 
Heaven will know 
That I need you so 
I can't say : goodbye lady 

Heaven will know 
That I'll never let go 
And I'm stay untill my heart stand still 
No matter what baby 
Feel what you want 
Heaven sent me an angel 
Heaven sent me a star 

Don't let me down 
Take my hand 
Now and forever be my friend 
Take my love and heart tonight 
You're a woman till the morning light 
I cry the tears I've never shown 
An empty house I call my home 
You're my angel in the night 
In the darkness you're the light 

Heaven will know 
Oh heaven will know my love 
Will grow baby 
Heaven will know 
That I need you so 
I can't say : goodbye lady 

Heaven will know 
That I'll never let go 
And I'm stay untill my heart stand still 
No matter what baby 
Feel what you want 
Heaven sent me an angel 
Heaven sent me a star 

And it's more than a passing face 
And it's more than a few nice days 
And it's more than I'll ever know 
And I never be alone 

Heaven will know 
Oh heaven will know my love 
Will grow baby 
Heaven will know 
That I need you so 
I can't say : goodbye lady 

Heaven will know 
That I'll never let go 
And I'm stay untill my heart stand still 
No matter what baby 
Feel what you want 
Heaven sent me an angel 
Heaven sent me a star
