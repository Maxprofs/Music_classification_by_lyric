The dynamic duo is back at it 
JB, Luda!

I love everything about you,
You're imperfect perfect,
Everyone's itching for beauty,
But you're scratchin' the surface
Lost time is never found,
can the DJ please reverse it
In life we pay for change,
let's make every second worth it

Anything can work, if you workin with 
People saying you don't deserve it
Then don't give in, 'Cuz hate may win
some battles, but love wins in the end
You shine just like the sun while the moon
and the stars reflect you light
Beautiful revolves around you 
so you like that??

All around the world, people want to be loved
All around the world, they're different than us

All around the world
(All around the world, people wanna be loved)
All around the world
(All around the world, they're no different than us)
All around the world
(all around the world, people wanna be loved)
