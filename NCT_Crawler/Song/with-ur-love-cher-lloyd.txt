[Cher Lloyd:]
Baby you the best cause you worked me out
I keep building walls up but you tear 'em down
I'm fighting I don't wanna like it but you know I like it
But you know I like it like it like it
Used to always think I was bullet proof
But you got an AK and your blowing through
Explosive, you don't even know it, I want you to know it
I want you to know it know it know it
All of them other boys can walk away
They ain't even in the game
Cause they know that you own it
You got this swag you got this attitude
Wanna hear you say my name
Cause you got me

[Chorus:]
Flying with your love, shining with your love, riding with your love
I feel like I'm on top of the world with your love
One hit with your love can't quit with your love so sick but so what
I feel like I'm on top of the world with your love

[Cher Lloyd:]
Everybody wants what I got with you
Cause I'm standing on top with a killer view
Inspired feeling like a million, I'm one in a million
I'm one in a million million million
I ain't even here I'm in outer space
Like I'm venus your mars in the milky way
It's crazy, what your doing to me, how you do it to me

How you do it to me to me to me
All of them other boys can walk away
They ain't even in the game
Cause they know that you own it
You got this swag you got this attitude
Wanna hear you say my name
Cause you got me

[Chorus:]
Flying with your love, shining with your love, riding with your love
I feel like I'm on top of the world with your love
One hit with your love can't quit with your love so sick but so what
I feel like I'm on top of the world with your love

[Mike Posner:]
U got it yea yea u got it

flying baby I'm shining baby I'm riding with your love
One hit baby I can't quit baby I'm so sick but so what
flying baby I'm shining baby I'm riding with your love
One hit baby I can't quit baby I'm so sick but so what

[Chorus:]
Flyi ng with your love, shining with your love, riding with your love
I feel like I'm on top of the world with your love
One hit with your love can't quit with your love so sick but so what
I feel like I'm on top of the world with your love
