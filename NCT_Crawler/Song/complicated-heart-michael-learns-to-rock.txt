                        Dont know what to say now
Dont know where to start
I dont know how to handle
A complicated heart
You tell me you are leaving
But I just have to say
Before you throw it all away

Chorus:
Even if you want to go alone
I will be waiting when youre coming home
If you need someone to ease the pain
You can lean on me, my love will still remain

Dont know what youre thinking
To me it seems quite tough
To hold a conversation
When words are not enough
So this is your decision
And theres nothing I can do
I can only say to you

Chorus:
Even if you want to go alone
I will be waiting when youre coming home
If you need someone to ease the pain
You can lean on me, my love will still remain
                        
                    |
