All that time he was taking her for granted 
She wants to see if there’s more 
Then he gave she’s looking for

Now he knows she’s smiling and 
Knows she’s using it 
Now he’s loosing it

He was always givin’ her attention 
Working hard to find the things she mentioned 
He was dedicated 
By most sucka’s hated 
That girl was fine 
But she didn’t appreciate him 

She calls him up she’s trippin’ on the phone 
Now had to get up and he ain’t comin home 
Now she’s tryin’ to forget him and 
The salary came with him 
When he first met her 
When they first got together
