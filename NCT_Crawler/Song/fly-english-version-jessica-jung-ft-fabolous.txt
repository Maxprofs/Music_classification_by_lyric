                        Bài hát: Fly (English Version) - Jessica Jung, Fabolous

I won’t lose, Fabolous
Somebody tell em I won’t lose Low so
I won’t lose (The young OG)
Somebody tell em I won’t lose

Invisible, push through the fog
I have to find my way, yeah
A glow of light, A spark of hope
If you imagine it you’ll find

You reaching for a things to follow your dreams
But nothing will stand in your way

You’re not far, you’re close
so stand up for yourself
It’s written in the sky

Just Spread Your Wings
Reach for your dreams
There’s no mountain that’s hard to move
(There’s no mountain that’s hard to move)
Take a chance and try
You would never know

You’re a Hero You Can Fly
You Can Fly
Woah woah woah
You’re a Hero You Can Fly
Woah woah woah
You Can Fly

Unthinkable, best is to come
The light is shining so bright now
No looking back, keep pressing on(hold on)
Cause Your Wings Are Made To Fly

You reaching for a things to follow your dreams
But nothing will stand in your way

You’re not far, you’re close
so stand up for yourself
It’s written in the sky

Just Spread Your Wings
Reach for your dreams
There’s no mountain that’s hard to move
(There’s no mountain that’s hard to move)
Take a chance and try
You would never know

You’re a Hero You Can Fly
You Can Fly
Woah woah woah
You’re a Hero You Can Fly
Woah woah woah
You Can Fly

I don’t plan on breaking down
I don’t plan on falling down

I Won’t Lose
I Won’t Lose
Oh No No No No No

Yeah Let’s Go Jess
You Should’ve Never
Doubted Yourself
Matter Of Fact You Should Be
Proud Of Yourself
‘Cause You Had To Find
A Way Go About It Yourself
Nobody Gave You Direction
Had To Route It Yourself
And You Never Got
Lost Losing’s Not An Option
No Time For L’s No Time To Fail
Winning Like Steph
Curry And Them We Warriors
Haters Wanna See Me
In a Crown Victoria
But I’m In a Benz AC on 70
Won’t Lose My Cool
Gotta Move Cleverly
Chess Not Checkers
Playing It With Strategy
Me And Jessica
That’s a Win Automatically

Just Spread Your Wings
Reach for your dreams
There’s no mountain that’s hard to move
(There’s no mountain that’s hard to move)
Take a chance and try
You would never know

You’re a Hero You Can Fly
You Can Fly
Woah woah woah
You’re a Hero You Can Fly
Woah woah woah
You Can Fly
