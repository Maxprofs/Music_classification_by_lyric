And you showed me everything there was
to know of love
Time will not betray the truth
And for all the years we've shared
I celebrate with you
For you...
Un fiorno t'incontrai
And me
Pensai, "Adesso lei"
Will be...
D'allora insieme noi...
Forever
You are all I know of love
How could I ask for more
You're everything I'm dreaming of
You're all I need from love
And every star above
Spells out your name
I swear I'll always feel the same
You're all I want
From love
All I want from love
Dimmi
Che e'per l'eternita
Like a memory
M'attirai ad abitare neipensieri tuoi
Con te
You are my only heart
In te
I loved you from the start
Noi due
Together not apart
Forever
You are all I know of love
How could I ask for more
You're everything I'm dreaming of
You're all I need from love
And every star above
Spells out your name
I swear I'll always feel the same
You're all I want
From love
You're all I want from love
Pensami
I think of him
Perche'io songno te
You'll be with me
Due cuori e un anima
My love flows free through you
...E liberi
I live my whole life
I'll live my life
To be with you
You'll always be the one who taught me
Everything my heart knows to be sure
My heart knows you
You're all I know of love
How could I ask for more
You're everything I'm dreaming of
You're all I need from love
And every star above
Every star above
Spells out your name
I swear I'll always feel the same
You're all I want
From love
You're all I want from love
You're all I know of love
