Come, arriba, let's go now!

Whoa tonight
Tonight we could be more than friends
Whoa tonight (yeah)
Tonight we should be more than friends (yeah)

We're in the corner of a crowded room
I want your lips, your body, boy, how soon
And if you like what we're doin'
Why don't we give in for the night

This might just be the night of you and I
If there's no distance in our hearts tonight
And if you like what we're doing
Why don't we give in for the night?

Whoa tonight
Tonight we could be more than friends
Whoa tonight (yeah)

From the first time that I saw the look in your eyes
I've been thinking about you for all of this time
Whoa tonight (yeah)
Tonight we could be more than friends (yeah)

Ain't looking for someone to call my own
But with you boy we're in the danger zone
And if you like what we're doing
Why don't we give in for the night?

So here we are, I just dream of you
And all the things that I'm about to do to you
And if you like what we're doing
Why don't we give in for the night?

Whoa tonight
Tonight we could be more than friends
Whoa tonight (yeah)
Tonight we should be more than friends (yeah)

From the first time that I saw the look in your eyes
I've been thinking about you for all of this time
Whoa tonight (yeah)
Tonight we could be more than friends (yeah)

Everybody in the club was hot 'til I showed my watch
And they cooled out

Whatever you like
It's forever, (forever)
You could be mine
And I'm needing you right now
Baby come and hold me down
Caliente! Frío! Que eso que tu tiene mío.
