im cold, im cold, im cold

i got the right to put up a fight
but not quite cause you cut off my light
But my sight is better tonight and I might
see you in my nightmare, oh how did you get there
cause we were once a fairytale
But this is fair well

I got my life and its my only one
I got the night, I'm running from the sun
So goodnight, I made it out the door, door, door, door
After tonight, there will be no return
After tonight, I'm taking off on the road
I'm taking off on the road

And that you know, that you know
Tell every one that you know
That i dont love you no more
And thats one thing that you know
That you know...

Okay I'm back up on my grind
You do you and I'm just gone do mine
You do you, cause I'm just gone be fine
Okay I got you out my mind
The night is young, the drinks is cold
The stars is out, I'm ready to go
You always thought I was always wrong
Well know you know...
Tell everybody everybody that you know!!
Tell everybody that you know
That I don't love you no more
And thats one thing that you know
That you know

i got the right to put up a fight
but not quite cause you cut off my light
But my sight is better tonight and I might
see you in my nightmare, oh but how did you get there
cause we were once a fairytale
But this is fair well

BABY GIRL I'M FINISHED!
I THOUGHT WE WERE COMMITTED
I THOUGHT WE WERE CEMENTED
I REALLY THOUGHT WE MEANT IT
BUT NOW WE JUST REPENTIN
AND NOW WE JUST RESENTIN
THE CLOUDS IS IN MY VISION
LOOK HOW HIGH I BE GETTIN
AND ITS ALL BECAUSE OF YOU
GIRL WE THROUGH
YOU THINK YOUR *** DONT STANK,
BUT YOU ARE MRS. P-U
AND I DONT SEE YOU WITH ME NO MOOOORE
NOW TELL EVERYBODY THAT YOU KNOW
THAT YOU KNOW!
That you know

Tell everybody that you know
That I dont love you no more
And thats one thing that you know
That you know
That you know
Tell everyone that you know
That I dont love you no more
And thats one thing that you know
That you know...
