                        Bài hát: T.h.e (The Hardest Ever) - will.i.am, Mick Jagger, Jennifer Lopez

You can go hard or you can go home
You can go hard or you can go home
You can go hard or you can go home
You can go hard or you can go home

You can go hard or you can go home
You can go hard or you can go home
You can go hard or you can go home
You can go hard or you can go home

Oh my goodness, this beat is so hard...
Oh my goodness, this beat is so hard...

[will.i.am] 
Imma go hard, hard to the core
Hard like motha' fuckin' liquid swords
Harder than worldwide stadium tours
I am the future, delorian doors

Will he survive? Never deceased
I don't think I'mma ever rest in peace
Imma kill the game, leave the rest in pieces
Now everybody want my recipe
Tell a jealous chicken
I don't know what the beef is
I'm just making money for my grankids' nieces
Imma work hard, that's my basis
This beat is a ***, feces

Pardon me ma'am, Imma go dumb
Smart.i.am, I'm complicated, hard.I.am
I end the beginning, then start it again

[Hook]
You can go hard or you can go home
You can go hard or you can go home
You can go hard or you can go home
You can go hard or you can go home

You can go hard or you can go home
You can go hard or you can go home
You can go hard or you can go home
You can go hard or you can go home

Oh my goodness, this beat is so hard...
Oh my goodness, this beat is so hard...

[will.i.am] 
You can get that, or you can get this
You can call it demon, Imma call it jesus
You can get a curse, you can get a cross
You can go to work, or you can be the boss
Imma be the owner, be a donor
Imma go hard, like i'm on a fuckin' boner
Imma make the beat put the people in a coma
You can be a geek or be a rolling stoner


I woke up in the morning,
Hard like morning wood in the morning
Woke up thinking about my component
E.t own the mic phone the homeland

I wait out like NASA
I'm way over here I done past ya
I get stacks of cash, you get cashews, I go hard, statues

[Hook]
You can go hard or you can go home
You can go hard or you can go home
You can go hard or you can go home
You can go hard or you can go home

You can go hard or you can go home
You can go hard or you can go home
You can go hard or you can go home
You can go hard or you can go home

[Bridge]
Now let me take this time to say
I don't wanna beat you down
You can go hard or you can go home
Well I, I know it is a lot to take
I don't wanna beat you down
You can go hard or you can go home
You can go hard...

Wait a minute, Imma make it a little harder
Imma make it a little harder
Give it to you a little harder

THIS IS HARD....

[Mick Jagger]
Hard like a rock n roll
Time follows decades, explode
Vivid as a stan mode
Better move back now
It's bout to blow
Hard like Geometry, and Trigonometry
This is crazy
Psychology
Get it baby
I'm bou to win
Watch out now
I'm going in

You can go hard or you can go home
You can go hard
You can go hard or you can go home
You can go hard

You can go hard or you can go home
You can go hard
You can go hard or you can go home
You can go hard..
