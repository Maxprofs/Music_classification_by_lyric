                        Bài hát: Hero - Enrique Iglesias

(Let me be your hero)
Would you dance, if I asked you to dance
Would you run, and never look back
Would you cry, if you saw me crying
Would you save my soul tonight

Would you tremble, if I touched your lips
Would you laugh, oh please tell me this
Now would you die for the one you love
Hold me in your arms tonight

I can be your hero baby
I can kiss away the pain
I will stand by you forever
You can take my breath away

Would you swear, that you'll always be mine
Would you lie, would you run and hide
Am I in too deep, have I lost my mind
Well I don't care you're here tonight

I can be your hero baby
I can kiss away the pain
I will stand by you forever
You can take my breath away

Ohhh I just wanna hold you,
I just wanna hold you, oh yeah
Am I in too deep, have I lost my mind
Well I don't care you're here tonight

I can be your hero baby
I can kiss away the pain
(Ohhhhhhhhhhhh yeah)
I will stand by you forever
You can take my breath away

I can be your hero
I can kiss away the pain
And I will stand by you forever
You can take my breath away
You can take my breath away
I can be your hero ...
