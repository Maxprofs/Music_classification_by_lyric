                        Bài hát: What A Girl Is - Dove Cameron

On a scale from one to ten 
I am perfect like I am 
I don’t need your number 
We don’t need your number. 

And the stupid magazines 
Want me to change my everything 
They don’t even matter 
Their not takin’ my power. 

I’m so over all of these voices around 
They’ve said enough 
It’s my turn lets get loud. 

I’ll show you what a girl is 
Cause all of me is perfect 
Who cares about a dress size 
It’s all about that inside 
I’ll stand up now and won’t back down. 

Where breaking through the surface 
To show you what a girl is. 

We’re flawless in our skin 
Your words don’t mean anything 
I’m done wasting my time 
I can make up my own mind. 

I’m so over all of these voices around 
They’ve said enough 
It’s my turn lets get loud. 

I’ll show you what a girl is 
Cause all of me is perfect 
Who cares about a dress size 
It’s all about that inside 
I’ll stand up now and won’t back down. 

Where breaking through the surface 
To show you what a girl is. 

You’re exactly what your made to be 
I swear don’t be afraid 
Just to put yourself out there. 

Its pretty clear that you won’t see us 
On the sidelines where gonna take it 
Over standing like a high ride 
And if you ever doubt a word a girl can do 
Sit back and let us show you 
Its been really nice to know you 
No doubt where force 
Its undeniable get together 
And we’ll build this house right down on y’all 
I got a feeling that where gonna be there for yah 
Sit back and let us show yah 
Because the girls are takin’ over. 

On a scale from one to ten 
I am perfect like I am 
I don’t need your number 
We don’t need your number. 

I’ll show you what a girl is 
Cause all of me is perfect 
Who cares about a dress size 
It’s all about that inside 
I’ll stand up now and won’t back down. 

Where breaking through the surface 
To show you what a girl is. 

Where breaking through the surface 
To show you what a girl is.
