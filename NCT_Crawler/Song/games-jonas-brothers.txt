I'm waiting for you right outside
The place we first locked eyes
(oh!)
I feel like we're both losing sight
We don't get to do this twice
And I wonder
Will you care
When I'm gone
And it's done
And I've really had enough
And I'm sorry for the trouble
It's been costing us so much
Splitting apart
It's getting harder to tell what you want
So bored with these games
(games)
Games
(games)
The last time that I left these steps
Was after our first kiss
I wonder why you haven't shown
I'll be leaving here alone
And I wonder
Will you care
When I'm gone
And it's done
And I've really had enough
And I'm sorry for the trouble
It's been costing us so much
Splitting apart
It's getting harder to tell what you want
So bored with these games
(games)

(Splitting apart its getting harder to tell what you want)
(So bored with these games, yeah)
(Splitting apart its getting harder to tell what you want)
(So bored with these)
(So bored with these games)
(Splitting apart its getting harder to tell what you want)
And I'm so Bored with these
I'm left in the dark
Never thought you'd be breaking my heart
And I'm so bored with these games
(games)
Games
(games)
Will you care
When I'm gone
And it's done
And I've really had enough
And I'm sorry for the trouble
It's been costing us so much
Splitting apart
Getting harder to tell what you want
So bored with these games
(games)

Woah games

Oh yeah games
