                        Yo, back up now an' give a brother room
 The fuse is lit an' I'm about to go boom
 Mercy, mercy, mercy me
 My life is a cage but on stage I'm free
 Hyped up, psyched up, ready for wil'in'
 Standin' in a crowd of girls like an island
 I see the one I wanna sit, come here, cutie
 I flip 'em around an' then I work that booty
 Work the body, work, work the body
 Slow down, girl, you're 'bout to hurt somebody
 Oh an' yo, let's get just one thing clear
 There's only one reason why I came here
 Ya really don't want me to tig a tig a tig a
 Tell ya wassup, go
 Ya really don't want me to tig a tig a tig a
 Tell ya wassup, go
 Ya really don't want me to tig a tig a tig a
 Tell ya wassup, go
 I came here tonight to hear the crowd go
 Boom, shake, shake, shake the room
 Boom, shake, shake, shake the room
 Boom, shake, shake, shake the room
 Tic, tic, tic, tic, boom
 Well, yo, are y'all ready for me yet?
 Pump it up, Prince
 Well, yo, are y'all ready for me yet?
 Pump it up, Prince
 Well, yo, are y'all ready for me yet?
 Pump it up, Prince
 Well, here I go, here I go, here I, here I go
 Yo, dance in the aisles when the Prince steps to it
 The rhyme is a football, y'all an' I went an' threw it
 Out in the crowd an' yo, it was a good throw
 How do I know? Because the crowd went, Hoo
 In response to the way that I was kickin' it
 Smooth an' individual, rhymes always original
 Like the Dr. Jekyll man an' this is my Hyde side
 I am the driver an' you're on a rap ride
 So fellas? Yeah? Are y'all wit me? Yeah
 I said fellas? Yeah? Are y'all wit me? Yeah
 Why don't you tell the girls what y'all wanna do
 Ya wanna ooh ahh ahh ahh ahh ooh
 That's right, yo an' I'm in the flow
 So pump up the volume along with the tempo
 I want everybody in the house to know
 I came here tonight to hear the crowd go
 Boom, shake, shake, shake the room
 Boom, shake, shake, shake the room
 Boom, shake, shake, shake the room
 Tic, tic, tic, tic, boom
 Boom, shake, shake, shake the room
 Boom, shake, shake, shake the room
 Boom, shake, shake, shake the room
 Tic, tic, tic, tic, boom
 Pump it up, pump it up, come on now
 Pump it up, pump it up, come on now
 Pump it up, pump it up, come on now
 Pump it up, pump it up, come on now
 Pump it up, pump it up, come on now
 Pump it up, pump it up, come on now
 Pump it up, pump it up, come on now
 Pump it up, pump it up, come on now
 Boom, shake, shake, shake the room
 Boom, shake, shake, shake the room
 Boom, shake, shake, shake the room
 Tic, tic, tic, tic, boom
 The the F-f-fresh P-p-prince is who I am
 So tell my mother that I never make a whack jam
 But some times I get n-n-nervous an' start to stutter
 An' I f-f-fumble every word for word I utter
 So I just try to ch-ch-chill
 But it gets worse a but worse a but, but, but worse still
 I need the c-c-crowd to k-k-kick into it
 They help me calm down an' I can get through it
 So higher, higher, get ya hands to the ceilin'
 Let it go, y'all, don't fight the feelin'
 Mic in a strangle hold, sweat pourin'
 An' like Jordan, yo' I'm scorin'
 Yeah, that's right, y'all an' I am in the flow
 So pump up the volume along with the tempo
 Many have died tryin' to stop my show
 I came here tonight to here the crowd go
 Boom, shake, shake, shake the room
 Boom, shake, shake, shake the room
 Boom, shake, shake, shake the room
 Tic, tic, tic, tic, boom
 Boom, shake, shake, shake the room
 Boom, shake, shake, shake the room
 Boom, shake, shake, shake the room
 Tic, tic, tic, tic, boom
 Boom, shake, shake, shake the room
 Boom, shake, shake, shake the room
 Boom, shake, shake, shake the room
 Tic, tic, tic, tic, boom
 Boom, shake, shake, shake the room
