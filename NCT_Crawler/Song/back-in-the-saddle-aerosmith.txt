Back In The Saddle
I'm back!
I'm back in the saddle again
I'm back!
I'm back in the saddle again


ridin' into town alone by the light of the moon
I'm lookin' for old Sukie Jones, she crazy horse saloon
barkeep gimme a drink, that's when she caught my eye
she turned to give me a wink, that'd make a grown man cry

I'm back in the saddle again
I'm back!
I'm back in the saddle again
I'm back!

Come easy, go easy, all right until the rising sun
I'm calling all the shots tonight, I'm like a loaded gun
peelin' off my boots and chaps, I'm saddle sore
four bits gets you time in the racks, I scream for more
fools' gold out of their mines, the girls are soaking wet
no tongue's drier than mine, I'll come when I get back!

I'm back in the saddle again
I'm back!
I'm back in the saddle again

I'm ridin', I'm loadin' up my pistol
I'm ridin', I really got a fistful
I'm ridin', I'm shinin' up my saddle
I'm ridin', this snake is gonna rattle

I'm back in the saddle again
I'm back!
I'm back in the saddle again
I'm back!

Ridin' high!
Ridin' high!
Ridin' high!
