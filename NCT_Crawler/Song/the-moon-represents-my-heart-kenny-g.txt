                        Bài hát: The Moon Represents My Heart - Kenny G

You ask how deeply I love you
I love you a few minutes.
My love is true, my love is true
The moon represents my heart
You ask how deeply I love you
I love you a few minutes.
My love do not move, do not change my love
...PTKPro

The moon represents my heart
Just one question, once touched my heart
...PTKPro
A deep love, taught me to miss that now
You ask how deeply I love you
I love you a few minutes.
You to want to think, you go have a look
The moon represents my heart 
...PTKPro
