                        Bài hát: Every Heart - Minna No Kimochi - BoA

Romaji

Ikutsu namida o nagashitara 
Every heart sunao ni nareru darou 
Dare ni omoi tsutaetara 
Every heart kokoro mitasareru no darou 

Nagai nagai yoru ni obieteita 
Tooi hoshi ni inotteta 

Meguru meguru toki no naka de 
Bokutachi wa ai o sagashiteiru 
Tsuyoku tsuyoku naritai kara 
Kyou mo takai sora miageteiru 

Donna egao o deaetara 
Every heart yume ni fumidaseru no 
Hito wa kanashimi no mukou ni 
Every heart shiawase ukabete nemuru 

Itsuka itsuka subete no tamashii ga 
Yasuraka ni nareru you ni 

Meguru meguru toki no naka de 
Bokutachi wa ikite nanika o shiru 
Toki ni warai sukoshi naite 
Kyou mo mata aruki tsuzuketeyuku 

Osanai kioku no katasumi ni 
Atatakana basho ga aru soushi 
Hoshitachi ga hanasu mirai wa 
Itsumo kagayaiteita so shine 

Meguru meguru toki no naka de 
Bokutachi wa ai o sagashiteiru 
Tsuyoku tsuyoku naritai kara 
Kyou mo takai sora miageteiru 

Meguru meguru toki no naka de 
Bokutachi wa ikite nanika o shiru 
Toki ni warai sukoshi naite 
Kyou mo mata aruki tsuzuketeyuku 


Translation 

How many tears must be shed 
Every Heart, Before we can become honest? 
To whom must we proclaim our feelings 
Every Heart, So that we can no longer feel loneliness? 

I was frightened by the long, long nights 
I prayed to the distant stars 

Round and round in looping time 
We are searching for love 
For we want to grow stronger and stronger 
We still look up to the high skies today 

What kind of smile must we come across 
Every heart, Before we can take a step towards our dreams? 
A person in the face of sadness 
Every Heart, His happiness drifts in slumber 

Someday, someday, may all souls 
Find true peace 

Round and round in looping time 
We live and come to understand things 
At times laughing, sometimes crying 
We will continue to walk again today 

In the corners of my childhood memories 
There is a warm place, So Sweet 
Where the stars talk of a future 
That will always sparkle, So Shine 

Round and round in looping time 
We are searching for love 
For we want to grow stronger and stronger 
We still look up to the high skies today 

Round and round in looping time 
We live and come to understand things 
At times laughing, sometimes crying, 
We will continue to walk again today
                        
                    |
