                        Bài hát: Imaginate (Radio Edit) - KSHMR, Dzeko & Torres

I don't want to live and learn
Sorry I don't want to change
Thinking about the way we were
It takes me to another place
Because I

I don't want to wake up from this dream

It's our own reality
So close your eyes open your mind
And let it free
Imaginate and realize
It's all you need
I don't want leave this place

Standing still in my pretend
Give me just a little space
To figure out myself again
Because I
I don't want to wake up from this dream

It's our own reality
So close your eyes open your mind
And let it free
Imaginate and realize
It's all you need
                        
                    |
