Kill me!



Killing me DJ

with another sad song

Killing me DJ

with another sad love song

ten feet under now

singing wow, wow, yeah, yeah

(x2)



I’m gonna burn your letters in the morning

put all the faded pictures in a box



But till then (killing me dj)

(killing me dj) I just need my time

before I face the end

ohhh!



Killing me DJ

with another sad song

Killing me DJ

with another sad love song

ten feet under now

singing wow, wow, yeah, yeah

(x2)



No one said the best loves last forever

and even the strong ones need to cry

I just can’t stand to lose (killing me dj)

I know it just takes some time (killing me dj)

for a heart to mend, for a heart to mend!



Killing me DJ

with another sad song

Killing me DJ

with another sad love song

ten feet under now

singing wow, wow, yeah, yeah

(x2)



Yea hee, ya-yahee, ya-yo

If I could turn back time

I would do it again

(x2)



Another mistake for me to live through

but I already knew that heroes fall

If I could turn back time (killing me dj)

I would do it again

Oh, I’d do it again



Killing me DJ

with another sad song

Killing me DJ

with another sad love song

ten feet under now

singing wow, wow, yeah, yeah

(x3)



Killing me DJ

with another sad song

Killing me DJ

with another sad love song

ten feet under now

singing wow, wow...



Just give me some time
