                        I hear your heart beat to the beat of the drums
Oh what a shame that you came here with someone
So while you’re here in my arms
Let’s make the most of the night like we’re gonna die young
We’re gonna die young, we’re gonna die young
Let’s make the most of the night like we’re gonna die young
Let’s make the most of the night like we’re gonna die young
Hearts, out our minds (?)
Running till we out of time
Wild childs, looking good
Living hard, just like we should
Don’t care who’s watching when we tearing up
That magic that we got that nobody can touch
Looking for some trouble tonight
Take my hand, I’ll show you the wild side
Like it’s the last night of our lives
We’ll keep dancing ‘till we die
I hear your heart beat to the beat of the drums
Oh what a shame that you came here with someone
So while you’re here in my arms
Let’s make the most of the night like we’re gonna die young
We’re gonna die young, we’re gonna die young
Let’s make the most of the night like we’re gonna die young
Let’s make the most of the night like we’re gonna die young
Punks, taking shots
Stripping down to dirty socks
Music up, getting hot
Kiss me, give you all you got
It’s pretty obvious that you got a crush
That magic in your pants is making blush
Looking for some trouble tonight
Take my hand, I’ll show you the wild side
Like it’s the last night of our lives
We’ll keep dancing ‘till we die
I hear your heart beat to the beat of the drums
Oh what a shame that you came here with someone
So while you’re here in my arms
Let’s make the most of the night like we’re gonna die young
I hear your heart beat to the beat of the drums
Oh what a shame that you came here with someone
So while you’re here in my arms
Let’s make the most of the night like we’re gonna die young
we’re gonna die young we’re gonna die young
Let’s make the most of the night like we’re gonna die young
