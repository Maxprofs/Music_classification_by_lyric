                        Holding on to pieces, of our summer, going by
 On a wall of memories, at the edges of my mind
 Whoa, they used to tell a story
 But they’re just paper to me now
 Whoa, they used to say 1000 words
 But now they can’t be heard

 [Chorus:]
 We ran out of time, said goodbye too soon
 Pictures being faded, of the summer nights in june
 Blurry all the memories, still remember what was true
 Pictures they are fading, changing, leaving
 A silhouette of you

 Foot stamps on the pavements
 I’m retracing every corner we turned to see
 If we could have kept these moments from burning
 To ashes and dust
 Whoa, they used to say 1000 words
 But now they can’t be heard

 [Chorus:]
 We ran out of time, said goodbye too soon
 Pictures being faded, of the summer nights in june
 Blurry all the memories, still remember what was true
 Pictures they are fading, changing, leaving
 A silhouette of you
 Whoa, whoa, whoa, a silhouette of you
 Whoa, whoa, whoa, a silhouette of you
 Whoa, whoa, whoa, a silhouette of you

 [Guitar solo]

 [Chorus:]
 We ran out of time, said goodbye too soon
 Pictures being faded, of the summer nights in june
 Blurry all the memories, still remember what was true
 Pictures they are fading, changing, leaving
 We ran out of time, said goodbye too soon
 Pictures being faded, of the summer nights in june
 Blurry all the memories, still remember what was true
 Pictures they are fading, changing, leaving
 A silhouette of you
                        
                    |
