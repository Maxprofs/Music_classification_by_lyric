                        Bài hát: Choose Your Battles - Katy Perry

All I really need is a little piece 
I just wanna be your heaven 
Oh, this is not a competition 
So baby why the ammunition 
I don’t wanna be the last one standing 

Choose your battles, babe 
Then you win the war 
Stop digging your own crave 
With this, so much to leave for 

Choose your battles, babe 
Cause I’m not fighting anymore 
I am not fighting anymore 

I try to pick off your red flags 
But dancing up on broken glass 
Your mind games hit like glue names 
Your course just like the Kennedys 
But you somehow get me on my knees, defeated 

Choose your battles, babe 
Then you win the war 
Stop digging your own crave 
With this, so much to leave for 

Choose your battles, babe 
Cause I’m not fighting anymore 
I am not fighting anymore
                        
                    |
