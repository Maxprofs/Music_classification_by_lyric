                        Bài hát: Kirai... Demo Suki - Aishiteru - Nightcore, BRIGHT


Kirai Kirai Kirai Kirai
Kimi no koto nanka
Demo suki suki suki 
Suki dakara koko ga itai yo

Aishiteru so aishiteru
Sore dakega tsutaetakute
Demo kimi ga tooi yo
Konnani soba ni iru noni naze

Atarimae no koi ni akogare terunante
If dareka ni kika retemo
I cant say eien ai

I hope that ano futari wakare chaibai
Danante doukashiteru baka mitai watashi
You are the only one for me
Konnaru hazu jana katta

Aishiteru so Aishiteru
Sore dakega tsutaetakute
Demo kimi ga tooi yo
Konnani soba ni iru noni naze

Egao narabu yoko de 
Uzukumaru Secret of mine
Tsurarete warattetemo so My heart naiteta

It's friday futari tetsunai kuteru egao
Tsurakute setsunakute me wo fuse ta
You are the only one for me
Doushite watashi janai no

Aishiteru so Aishiteru
Sore dakega tsutaetakute
Demo kimi ga tooi yo
Konnani soba ni iru noni naze

Aitakute Aenakute
Kotoba wa sunao ni narenakute
Kowashi Takunaikara
Nanimo nanimo ienai

Ima doko de nani omotte
Donna kyoku wo kiteruno
Tell me baby please oshiete
Kagena demo iikara My Heart

Aishiteru so Aishiteru
Sore dakega tsutaetakute
Demo kimi ga tooi yo
Konnani soba ni iru noni naze

Translation
I hate, I hate, I hate, I hate
Something about you
But I like, I like, I like
I like you so it hurts here (in my chest)

I love you, yeah, I love you
I just want to tell you that
But why do you seem so far away
despite that you are right beside me

I am longing for a normal relationship
Even if someone were to ask
I can't say eternal love

I hope that those two would break up
You tell me I want an idiot
You are the only one for me
There doesn't have to be a reason

I love you, yeah, I love you
I just want to tell you that
But why do you seem so far away
despite that you are right beside me?

A line of smile is formed by width
The crouching secret of mine
I laughed sheepishly so my heart didn't cry

It's Friday two of us can't share a smile
My eyes hold pain and loneliness 
You are the only one for me
Why aren't I the same for you?

I love you, yeah, I love you
I just want to tell you that
But why do you seem so far away
despite that you are right beside me?

I miss you, i really miss you
Those words become true
I don't want to break, so
I can't say anything...anything

Where are you now, thinking of what? 
What song are you listening to?
Tell me baby please enlighten me
To make my heart content

I love you, yeah, I love you
I just want to tell you that
But why do you seem so far away
despite that you are right beside me?

I hate, I hate, I hate, I hate
Something about you
But I like, I like, I like
I like it, so it's getting far away.
