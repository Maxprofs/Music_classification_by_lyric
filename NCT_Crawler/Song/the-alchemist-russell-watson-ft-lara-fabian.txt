                        In the desert where almost nothing grows
 You'll find the most beautiful rose
 Takes its name from Jericho, a miracle of life
 I know a place I can't deny Where even a Jericho rose would die
 The desert of your heart's
 Where I am trying to survive Can't control this, can't let go this
 Feeling is all I have, I know that I could build a tower out of steel and stone
 But trying to build a bridge to you
 Is something I can't seem to do
 If I could turn this dust to gold, you'd see it clearly
 Trying to earn your love is just like
 Trying to learn the art of alchemy Measure of a woman's heart
 Is just how deep and just how far
 A secret can be kept
 Till it is only distant memory My emotions fall on stony ground
 I wear them just like hand-me-downs
 Because I know the secret is the love
 That you have for me I can't believe, can hardly breathe
 Without you by my side, I know that I could build a tower out of steel and stone
 But trying to build a bridge to you
 Is something I can't seem to do
 If I could turn this dust to gold, you'd see it clearly
 Trying to earn your love is just like
 Trying to learn the art of alchemy How could life be the same
 If I find I loved in vain
 The dream I have every night
 Is to wake with you by my side I could build a tower out of steel and stone
 But trying to build a bridge to you
 Is something I can't seem to do
 If I could turn this dust to gold, you'd see it clearly
 Trying to earn your love is just like
 Trying to learn the art of alchemy Trying to earn your love is just like
 Trying to learn the art of alchemy
