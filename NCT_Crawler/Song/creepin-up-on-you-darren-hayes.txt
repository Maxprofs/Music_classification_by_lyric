                        Creepin' up on you _Darren Hayes

One, two, one, two, three.
(yeah yeah, oh~ho. oh yeah. doo doo doo doo)
Creepin' up on you is the wrong thing to do
I found your address got your phone number too
Visit all the stores where you buy all your clothes
Been to secret places you think nobody knows

If I have to live without you, nobody could
I need to be around you
Watchin' you

No one else can love you like I do
Feel it when I'm creepin' up on you
I know that it wouldn't be right
If I stayed all night
Just to peek in on you
Creepin' up on you..

I’ve been hanging 'round all the places you haunt
Spying on your friends to find out what you want
Drinking from the glass that you left on the bar
Follow you around driving home in your car....

Do I have to breathe without you? 'Cause nobody could
I need to be around you
Watching you

No one else can love you like I do
Feel it when I'm creepin' up on you
I know that it wouldn't be right
If I stayed all night
Just to peek in on you
Creepin' up on you..

I'm creepin' up on you

I know this must be wrong
It can't go on
This kind of thing
It's taking all my sanity
and making me a mockery
This must be wrong
It can't go on
So won't somebody free me from this misery
Bring my baby closer to me (yeah..)
(Doo doo doo.. doo doo doo doo doo yeah.)

(Oh) 'Cause no one else can love you like I do
You feel it when I'm creepin' up on you
I know that it wouldn't be right
If I stayed all night
Just to peek in on you.. creepin'

No one else can love you like I do
(I know you) Feel it when I'm creepin' up on you
I know that it wouldn't be right
If I stayed all night
Just to peek in on you
Creepin' up on you...

'Cause no one else can love you (no, no) like I do
(I know you) Feel it (when I'm creepin' up on you)
Watching everything you do
'Cause no one else can love you (no) like I do
No one else should love you (no) like I do
Baby, creepin' up on you
Watching everything you do (yeah)
'Cause no one else can love you.. (no)
No one else should touch you.. (no)
No one else can love you.. touch you.. love you.. be with you.. (no) like I do [fade]


 Hehe
