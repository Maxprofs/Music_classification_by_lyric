                        Somewhere over the rainbow
 Way up high
 There's a land that I heard of
 Once in a lullaby Somewhere over the rainbow
 Skies are blue
 And the dreams that you dare to dream
 Really do come true Some day I'll wish upon a star
 And wake up where the clouds are far behind me
 Where troubles melt like lemon drops
 Away above the chimney tops, that's where you'll find me Somewhere over the rainbow
 Skies are blue
 Birds fly over the rainbow
 Why then, oh why can't I?
