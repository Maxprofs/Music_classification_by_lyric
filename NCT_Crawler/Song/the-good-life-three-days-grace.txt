                        Bài hát : The Good Life - Three Days Grace

The good life is
What I need
Too many people
Stepping over me
The only thing that's
Been on my mind
Is the one thing I need before I die

[Chorus:]
All I want is a little of
The good life
All I need is to have
A good time
The good life

I don't really know
Who I am
It's time for me
To take a stand
I need a change
And I need it fast
I know that any day
Could be the last

[Chorus x2]

Hold on, hold on
I always wanted it this way
I never wanted it this way
Hold on, hold on
I always wanted it this way
We didn't ask for it this way
I always wanted this way

[Chorus x2]
                        
                    |
