                        Bài hát: Work this out - High School Musical

[Chad:]
How did we get from the top of the world
To the bottom of the heap

[Taylor:]
I don't recall you mentioning
The boss is such a creep

[Zeke:]
We still have the ingredients
To make this summer sweet

[Martha:]
Well, I got rags instead of riches

[Jason:]
And all these dirty dishes

[All except Troy and Gabriella:]
I wish I had three wishes

[Gabriella:]
(Okay, guys, break it up)

[Troy:]
We've got to work, work
To work this out
We'll make things right
The sun will shine

We've got to work, work
There'll be no doubt
We can still save the summer
If we work this out

[Chad:]
(Dude, what have you gotten us into?)

[Troy:]
(Come on, we can totally turn this thing around)

[Chad:]
I'd rather face a seven footer
Straight up in the post

[Taylor:]
That sure beats hangin' here

[Taylor & Martha:]
And burning someone's toast

[Jason:]
I needed Benjamins
But this ain't worth the stress

[Kelsi:]
Maybe there's a better way
To fix this greasy mess

[Troy:]
We're a champion team
A well-oiled machine
And we've faced tougher problems than this

I know it's a grind
But I'm sure we can find
A way to have fun
While we get this job done

[Troy & Gabriella:]
We've got to work, work
To work this out
We'll make things right
The sun will shine

We've got to work, work
There'll be no doubt
We can still save the summer

[Troy, Gabriella, Zeke, Kelsi:]
If we work this out

[Troy:]
Tell me what you want

[Gabriella:]
Tell me what you need

[Zeke:]
A little bit of sugar

[Martha:]
A little bit of butter

[Kelsi:]
It's the perfect recipe

[All:]
Pay day!

[Jason:]
It'll taste so sweet

[All:]
Pay day!

[Zeke:]
Good enough to eat

[Jason:]
Gonna make some motion pictures

[Martha:]
Hit the mall with all my sisters

[Zeke:]
Get tickets to the Knicks and Sixers

[Kelsi:]
Kick it with the music mixers

[Chad:]
Buy a ride that suits my style

[Taylor:]
Lounge around the pool and while

[Troy:]
Make a date with my favorite girl

[Troy & Gabriella:]
We've got it made!

[All:]
We've got to work, work
To work this out
We'll make things right
The sun will shine

We've got to work, work
There'll be no doubt
We can still save the summer
If we work this out
                        
                    |
