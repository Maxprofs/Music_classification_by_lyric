I need you boo
I gotta see you boo
And the hearts all over the world tonight
Said the hearts all over the world tonight

I need you boo (ooh!)
I gotta see you boo (yay!)
And the hearts all over the world tonight
Said the hearts all over the world tonight

Hey lil mama
Ooo you're a stunna
Hot lil figure
Yes you a winner and,
I'm so glad to be yours
You're a class all your own and,
Oo lil cutie
When you talk to me
I swear the whole world stops,
You're my sweetheart and,
I'm so glad that you're mine
You are one of a kind and,
You mean to me, what I mean to you
And, together baby there is nothing we won't do

Cause if I got you, I don't need money
I don't need cars
Girl you're my heart
And...

Oh...
I'm into you and girl
No.. one else will do
Cause with every kiss, and every hug
You make me, fall in love
And now I, no I can't be the only one...
I bet its hearts all over the world tonight
With the love of their life
Who feel, what I feel
When i'm...
With you, with you, with you, with you, with you
Girl...
With you, with you, with you, with you, with you

Oh Girl

Without you there's no one left and..
You like Jordan's on Saturday
I gotta have you and I cannot wait now
Hey lil shawty, say ya care for me
You know I care for you
You know that I'll be true
You know that I won't lie
You know that I will try
To be you're everything... yeahh

Will never try to deny
That you were my whole life
Cause if you, ever let me go
