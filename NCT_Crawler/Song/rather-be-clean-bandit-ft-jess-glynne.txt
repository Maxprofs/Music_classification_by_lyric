                        Bài hát: Rather Be - Clean Bandit, Jess Glynne

Oh, Woah, Ooh, Yeah 

[Verse 1:] 
We're a thousand miles from comfort, we have traveled land and sea 
But as long as you are with me, there's no place I'd rather be 
I would wait forever, exalted in the scene 
As long as I am with you, my heart continues to beat 

[Pre-Chorus:] 
With every step we take, Kyoto to The Bay 
Strolling so casually 
We're different and the same, get you another name 
Switch up the batteries 

[Chorus:] 
If you gave me a chance I would take it 
It's a shot in the dark but I'll make it 
Know with all of your heart, you can't shake me 
When I am with you, there's no place I'd rather be 
N-n-no, no, no place I'd rather be [x3] 

[Verse 2:] 
We staked out on a mission to find our inner peace 
Make it everlasting so nothing's incomplete 
It's easy being with you, sacred simplicity 
As long as we're together, there's no place I'd rather be 

[Pre-Chorus] 

[Chorus] 

When I am with you, there's no place I'd rather be, yeah 

[Bridge:] 
Beeeeeeeeee, hooooooo oh 
Be [x9] 
Yeah-e-yeah-e-yeah-e-yeah-e-yeah, yeah, yeah 

[Chorus] 

When I am with you, there's no place I'd rather be
                        
                    |
