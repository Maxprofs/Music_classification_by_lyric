                        Bài hát: Cool Kids (Glee Cast Version) - Glee Cast

[Jane]
 She sees them walking in a straight line, 
 That's not really her style

[Mason]
 And they all got the same heartbeat, 
 But hers is falling behind

[Madison with Roderick]
 Nothing in this world could ever bring them down
 Yeah, they're invincible, 
 And she's just in the background

[Madison]
 And she says,

[Madison with Mason and New Directions]
 "I wish that I could be like the cool kids,
 'Cause all the cool kids, they seem to fit in.
 I wish that I could be like the cool kids, like the cool kids."

[Kitty]
 He sees them talking with a big smile, 
 But they haven't got a clue
 Yeah, they're living the good life, 
 Can't see what he is going through

[Spencer with Roderick]
 They're driving fast cars, 
 But they don't know where they're going
 In the fast lane, living life without knowing
 And he says,

[Myron with Spencer and New Directions]
 "I wish that I could be like the cool kids,
 'Cause all the cool kids, they seem to fit in
 I wish that I could be like the cool kids, like the cool kids
 I wish that I could be like the cool kids,
 'Cause all the cool kids, they seem to get it
 I wish that I could be like the cool kids, like the cool kids"

[Kitty]
 And they said,
 "I wish that I could be like the cool kids,
 'Cause all the cool kids, they seem to fit in
 I wish that I could be like the cool kids, like the cool kids

[Kitty and Myron with Spencer and New Directions]
 I wish that I could be like the cool kids,
 'Cause all the cool kids, they seem to fit in
 I wish that I could be like the cool kids, like the cool kids

[Myron with Spencer and New Directions]
 I wish that I could be like the cool kids,
 'Cause all the cool kids, they seem to get it
 I wish that I could be like the cool kids, like the cool kids."

[New Directions]
 Whoa
 Whoa 
 Whoa

[Spencer with Roderick]
 Like the cool kids
                        
                    |
