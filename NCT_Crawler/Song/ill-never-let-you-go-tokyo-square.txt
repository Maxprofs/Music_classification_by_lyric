Never thought I 'd meet someone
Someone who could make me smile
Never thought I 'd meet someone
Someone who could make brighten all my days
The day I met you
I could see my dream come true
I know I can't let go
This opportunity of loving you

Never felt this way
Don't know what to say
Something 's burning here deep down in my heart
Never be the same
When you come my way
Something 's telling me we will never part
Everytime I think about you
You just make my whole life fell so brand new
Everytime I dream about you
You're always by my side

Promise me you 'll stay
Always be with me
We'll be as happy as we can be
Promise me you 'll stay
Always by my side
No matter what it 'd take to be
