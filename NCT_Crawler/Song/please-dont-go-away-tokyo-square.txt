                        In the stillness of the night
We are holding each other tight
Your heart's beat is all i hear
It's touches is all I feel
And the silent of the night, I can only feel that is right
The time left will be unkind, I know I will be fine
Could this love so true, that we can always be together only love is real
Don't you, don't you , don't you ever hurt me, hurt this fragile heart of mine
Could this love so strong that we can always be together only love is real
Oh my love ..., don't make me shed a tear ...
Once I had a broken heart, never thought of having to part
The day you came into my life, I know now love is right
