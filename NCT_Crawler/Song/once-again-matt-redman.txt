                        Jesus Christ, I think upon Your sacrifice
 You became nothing
 Poured out to death
 Many times, I've wondered at your gift of life
 I'm in that place once again
 I'm in that place once again And once again I look upon the cross where You died
 I'm humbled by Your mercy and I'm broken inside
 Once again I thank You,
 Once again I pour out my life Now You are exhalted to the highest place
 King of the Heavens, where one day I'll bow
 But for now, I'll marvel at Your saving grace
 I'm full of praise once again
 Oh I'm full of praise once again And once again I look upon the cross where You died
 I'm humbled by Your mercy and I'm broken inside
 Once again I thank You
 Once again I pour out my life Thank you for the cross
 Thank you for the cross
 Thank you for the cross, my friend And once again I look upon the cross where You died
 I'm humbled by Your mercy and I'm broken inside
 Once again I thank You
 Once again I pour out my life
                        
                    |
