                        Bài hát: The Lonely Shepherd - James Last

I am lonely lonely lonely
I am lonely lonely in my life
I am lonely lonely lonely
God help me, help me to survive

Remember first time we met day one
Kids in the garden’ playin’ games heaven’ fun
Excitin’ and amazin’ havin’ a real friend of mine
Feel my heartbeat and for real friend of mine

Face to face and eye to eye
Usin’ our hands to buy and supply
Chillin’ is cool from January to June
And we still sticked together like the glue

And know the rules
Forever you and I and believe it was clear
If I ever should fall
I could count on you with no fear

Runnin’ out of time I see who’s fake
Alone without protection from all them snakes
All for one one for all i was told
Black white yellow no matter

If your young or old
Nana’s in the house to let you know
What I see is how I fell and damn
I’m alone

I am lonely lonely lonely
I am lonely lonely in my life
I am lonely lonely lonely
God help me, help me to survive

Everybody’s tripppin’ on me
Oh Lord, come help me please
I did some bad things in my life
Why can’t you rescue me

‘Cause you’ve got all I need
I know I got to pay the price
Cheppin’ through the streets at night
After a fuss and fight

Tears in my eyes I’m a man lookin’ for the light
Dark is the path I know he will rescue me
The Lord is my Shepard I’m cool despite emergency
Whom shall I fear except the God

Thank you for the blessin’ and the skills on the mic
Five years we know there’s no diggity
Free at last see the light in me
What goes up must come down

I’ll be around while you heading towards death town
Always look forward hardly never look back
So many tears and the snakes on my jock
Now I’m riding in my big fat ride

Your ass is late so look for the line
Nana in the house to let you know
What I see is how
I feel so leave me alone

I am lonely lonely lonely
I am lonely lonely in my life
I am lonely lonely lonely
God help me, help me to survive

Knock on my door whom you lookin’ for
A dream or reality enemies at my door
Eyes, I realize it’s fantasize I must be high
So let me live before I die

Once again grab the bottle twist the cap
To survive your life is yours my life is mine
No emotions in this world full of lies
Step by step and be versatile

Love peace and cash that’s what it’s all about
Alone by yourself than you lack there’s no doubt about
I’m always into something making moves to improve
What would you do if you were in my shoes

Boom a letter oops another suicide
Meet me for a ride at the boulevard
Nana’s in the house to let you know
What I see is how I feel and damn I’m alone
                        
                    |
