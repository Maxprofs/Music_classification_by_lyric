                        Bài hát: Sound Of My Dream (Remix) - DJ HS145

I, i want to go 
I want to run, run to the places where i can be 
I wanna know what is the sound 
The sound out of something reminding me 
I want to go, i got to run 
Run to the moment and set me free 
You tell me boy i hear the sound 
Sound of my dream 

... 

So now 
Now is the time to make it right 
Now is the time to feel the heat 
Sound of my dream lyrics on 
Just move your body to the beat 

... 

I, i want to go 
I want to run, run to the places where i can be 
I wanna know what is the sound 
The sound out of something reminding me 
I want to go, i got to run 
Run to the moment and set me free 
You tell me boy i hear the sound 
Sound of my dream
