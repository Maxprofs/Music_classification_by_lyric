                        Bài hát: Beautiful Boy (Darling Boy) - John Lennon

Close your eyes, 
Have no fear, 
The monsters gone, 
He's on the run and your daddy's here,

Beautiful, 
Beautiful, beautiful, 
Beautiful Boy,

Before you go to sleep, 
Say a little prayer, 
Every day in every way, 
It's getting better and better,

Beautiful, 
Beautiful, beautiful, 
Beautiful Boy,

Out on the ocean sailing away, 
I can hardly wait, 
To see you to come of age, 
But I guess we'll both, 
Just have to be patient, 
Yes it's a long way to go, 
But in the meantime,

Before you cross the street, 
Take my hand, 
Life is just what happens to you, 
While your busy making other plans,

Beautiful, 
Beautiful, beautiful, 
Beautiful Boy, 
Darling, 
Darling, 
Darling Sean.
