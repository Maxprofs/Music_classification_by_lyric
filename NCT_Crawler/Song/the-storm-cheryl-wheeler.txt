                        Bài hát: The Storm - Cheryl Wheeler

Trouble on the rise from the middle of a stormy sea
Muffled in the skies on the edges of the whole country
Blowing home heavy hearts again
In a moan, frozen on the wind
I never knew a sky so gray
On an icy day
As the wind blows down
On a sea coast town

Harboring the beast that the power of the wind controls
Howling in the streets with the voices of the ancient souls
Old and frail primeval mysteries
Come to wail of unknown histories
I never heard a stronger cry
From a mournful sky
Over frozen land
In the winter's hand

Out along the shore in a hurricane of ice and foam
Swaying in the roar I was standing on the dock alone
In the night
Where the forces came to play
And maybe I
Should have known to turn away
But I never felt so drawn and bound
To the great unknown
'Til it turned me around
And it sent me home
                        
                    |
