                        Bài hát: All The Kids Are Depressed - Jeremy Zucker

How long have you been smiling?
It seems like it's been too long
Some days I don't feel like trying
So what the *** are you on?

[Pre-Chorus]
I think too much, we drink too much
Falling in love like it's just nothing
I want to know where do we go
When nothing's wrong

[Chorus]
'Cause all the kids are depressed
Nothing ever makes sense
I'm not feeling alright
Staying up 'til sunrise
And hoping *** is okay
Pretending we know things
I don't know what happened
My natural reaction is that we're scared
So I guess we're scared

[Verse 2]
No I can't really keep lying
'Cause I've been scared all along
I'm getting sick of sleeping in
While all my friends are popping pills
And I don't think that they're wrong

[Pre-Chorus]
I think too much, we drink too much
Falling apart like it's just nothing
I want to know where do we go
When nothing's wrong

[Chorus]
'Cause all the kids are depressed
Nothing ever makes sense
I'm not feeling alright
Staying up 'til sunrise
And hoping *** is okay
Pretending we know things
I don't know what happened
My natural reaction is that we're scared
So I guess we're scared

[Outro]
I won't deny it 'cause you saw what it was
I can't deny it if you won't give a ***
So I'll sew it up
You know I am so in love
                        
                    |
