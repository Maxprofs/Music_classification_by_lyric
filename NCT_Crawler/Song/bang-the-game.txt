                        You got them funny ass colors on
 Take them off
 If you in the club with ice on
 We taken em
 I thought you was a gangster
 Nigga you better shake it off (what) sha, sha, shake it off
 Or get banged on

 [The Game]
 Gettin' my Bang on
 Red strings on
 Lue vaton kicks, Lue vaton frames on
 Lue vaton belt holdin' the 4,5
 You know who I am bitch
 I'm Mr. Westside

 [Daz]
 This west west, It's nothin
 Get your pistols, get your flags
 Gangsters, we let us have?
 We cock it back and blast
 Like booyaka booyaka
 We lay the party down
 Ga, Ga, Game Dog Pound

 [The Game]
 Everybodddyyy Geettt dooowwnnn

 [Kurupt]
 Punk nigga, I nurture and breed
 I aint never gaved a *** bout a bitch's needs
 And bitch niggas try to invade our town
 I'mma lay them down
 Spray the K and get out

 [The Game]
 Say goodbye to the 6,4
 Hello to the 6 tray
 He aint never seen hydraulics
 Look at his bitch face
 Up..Down, now watch my *** scrape
 Daz call Snoop Imma Crip walk to get Dre
 And Blood bounce back, heat on the track
 Dribble rock like Wade and bounce like Shaq
 Trow an O' in a pot and watch it bounce right back
 Like that, Like that, Like that

 You got them funny ass colors on
 Take them off
 If you in the club with ice on
 We taken em
 I thought you was a gangster
 Nigga you better shake it off (what) sha, sha, shake it off
 Or get banged on


 [Daz]
 We street connected
 Respect that I get is pathetic
 When I did it, I must of admit it a nigga gon rep it
 Lil homies around here constantly on smash mode
 Lil niggas with pistols just blowin out our assholes
 This is how we givin'??
 The culture is how we livin
 Fresh out the hospital or fresh out the prison
 Real niggas for life, the rules of the G
 NWA got the D.R.E

 [The Game]
 We not S.T.A.R.'s
 We don't put stars on our shoes bitch
 We put the whole car on the shoes?
 We don't wanna see my car on the news
 I set it off like Queen Latifah
 Red Beam on the lina

 [Kurupt]
 Bang out
 Trippin in trafic, dippin the classics
 Dippin the classics, Whippin that asses
 Hood niggas ready to get it
 Your bitch can get it
 'cause I know she'll suck a dick in less then a minute
 'cause imma have to show them where the house at
 Two milli mac's,
 Semi Automatic situation on clap, In the back with a sac
 Cadillac all black like this and like that
 Bang, Broken like glass and plastic
 Bang out on them with a mask on plastic
 We got access to mask and plastic's?
 Purchase last week
 DPGC

 You got them funny ass colors on
 Take them off
 If you in the club with ice on
 We taken em
 I thought you was a gangster
 Nigga you better shake it off (what) sha, sha, shake it off
 Or get banged on

 Where Bath and ape Hoodie get strip in a club?
 Like a bitch in a club, Watch em strip in a club
 You like ice creams, Get a banana split in a club
 No Jewelery, you can't wear *** in the club
 And that goes for every nigga and bitch in the club
 So you better take it off before you get in the club
 Game and Dogg Pound outside sittin' on dubs
 Remember that

 You got them funny ass colors on
 Take them off
 If you in the club with ice on
 We taken em
 I thought you was a gangster
 Nigga you better shake it off (what) sha, sha, shake it off
 Or get banged on
