                        Bài hát: Spektrem - Shine

Eyes, in the sky gazing far into the night,
I raise my hand to the fire but it's no use,
Cuz' you can't stop it from shining through,

It's true,

Baby let the light shine through,
If you believe it's true,
Baby won't you let the light shine through,

For you !
