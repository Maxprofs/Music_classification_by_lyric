                        La da da da da da
La da da da da da
La da da da da da
It took too long
It took to long
It took too long for you to call back
And normally I would just forget that
Except for the fact it was my birthday
My stupid birthday

I played along
I played along
I played along
Rolled right off my back
But obviously my armor was cracked
What kind of a boyfriend would forget that?
Who would forget that?
The type of guy who doesn't see
What he has until she leaves
Don't let me go
Cause without me you know you're lost
Wise up now or pay the cost
Soon you will know

You're not living
'Til you're living, living with me
You're not winning
'Til you're winning, winning me
You're not getting
'Til you're getting, getting me
You're not living
'Til you're living, living for me

This is the potential breakup song
Our album needs just one
Oh baby please
Please tell me

We got along
We got along
We got along until you did that
Now all I want is just my stuff back
Do you get that?
Let me repeat that
[The Potential Breakup lyrics on http://www.metrolyrics.com]

I want my stuff back
You can send it in a box
I don't care
Just drop it off
I won't be home
Cause without me you know you're lost
Minus you, I'm better off
Soon you will know

You're not living
'Til you're living, living with me
You're not winning
'Til you're winning, winning me
You're not getting
'Til you're getting, getting to me
You're not living 'til you're living, living for me

You can try
You can try
You know that I'd know it'd be a lie
Without me you're gonna die
So you better think clearly, clearly
Before you nearly, nearly bust up the situation
That you're gonna miss dearly,dearly
Come on!

You're not living
'Til you're living, living with me
You're not winning
'Til you're winning, winning me
You're not getting
'Til you're getting, getting me
You're not living
'Til you're living, living for me

This is the potential breakup song
Our album needs just one
Oh baby please
Please, tell me

This is the potential make-up song
Please just admit you're wrong
Which will it be
Which will it be
                        
                    |
