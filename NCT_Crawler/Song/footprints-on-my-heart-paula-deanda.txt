                        "Footprints On My Heart"

You don't even hold me like you used to hold me
And there's no way you could of meant all the things you told me
Yeah, yeah
I remember when you told me you'd never lie to me
I can't believe I trusted you
I sacrificed my time and my heart
I gave you my all and what you do

You stepped on me, you walked on me
Boy you left your
Footprints on my
Heart broken crying over the way you left your
Footprints on my
Heart aching you ran all over me and left your
Footprints on my heart
My heart

I know the way you were before me
And I was crazy to think you'd change
I put up with your attitude
Your selfish ways and your childish games (whoa)
A good heart always ends up broken
But overtime, it'll make me strong
I'ma put the pieces back together
Might take some time, but I just go on

You stepped on me, you walked on me
Boy you left your
Footprints on my
Heart broken crying over the way you left your
Footprints on my
Heart aching you ran all over me and left your
Footprints on my heart
My heart

Love me or leave me alone
My heart can't take this pain
We had something so beautiful
But now it's not the same
So I gotta let this go
Gotta take back the truth
This situation makes no good for me
I can't believe I let it happen like this
I just sat back while you

You stepped on me, you walked on me
Boy you left your
Footprints on my
Heart broken crying over the way you left your
Footprints on my
Heart aching you ran all over me and left your
Footprints on my heart
My heart

Ooh, whoa, ooh
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Ooh
