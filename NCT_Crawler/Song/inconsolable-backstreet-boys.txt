                        I close the door 
Like so many times, so many times before 
Felt like a scene on the cutting room floor 
When I let you walk away tonight 
Without a word 

I try to sleep yeah 
But the clock is stuck on thoughts of you and me 
A thousand more regrets unraveling 
If you were here right now 
I swear I'd tell you this 

Baby, I don't wanna waste another day 
Keeping it inside it's killing me 
cause all I ever want, it comes right down to you to you 
I wish that I could find the words to say 
Baby, I would tell you every time you leave 
I'm inconsolable 

I climb the walls, yeah 
I can see the edge 
But I can't take the fall, no 
I'll never write the number 
So I cannot make the call 
Maybe cause I know 
You'll always be with me 
In the possibility 

Baby, I don't wanna waste another day (another day) 
Keeping it inside it's killing me 
'Cause all I ever want, it comes right down to you to you 
I wish that I could find the words to say 
Baby, I would tell you every time you leave 
I'm inconsolable 

Oh no no no 
I don't wanna be like this 
I just wanna let you know 
Everything that I'm holding 
Is everything i can't let go (can't let go) 

'Cuz baby, I don't wanna waste another day (another day) 
Keeping it inside it's killing me 
'Cause all I ever want, it comes right down to you to you 
I wish that I could find the words to say 
Baby, I would tell you every time you leave 
I'm inconsolable 

Don't you know it baby 
I don't want to waste another day 

I'm wishing that I could find the words to say 
Baby, I would tell you every time you leave 
I'm inconsolable 
Yeah-yeah-yeah 
Oh-oh 

I'm inconsolable 
Wow-oh-oh-yeah-oh 
I'm inconsolable
