Avril Lavigne-I Don\'t Have To Try
Album:The Best Damn Thing

I\'m the one I\'m the one
who knows the dance
I\'m the one I\'m the one
who\'s got the prance
I\'m the one I\'m the one
who wears the pants
I wear the pants
I\'m the one who tells you what to do
You\'re the one you\'re the one if I let you
I\'m the one I\'m the one
who wears the pants
I wear the pants

Hey You follow me
I\'ll take the lead can\'t you see
Don\'t you question me
You just do what I say
I don\'t care what you\'re saying
I don\'t care what you\'re thinking
I don\'t care about anything
Get ready get ready cause I\'m happening
I don\'t care what you\'re saying
I don\'t care what you\'re thinking
I don\'t care about anything
Get ready get ready cause I\'m on the scene
I don\'t have to try
To make you realize
Anything I wanna do
Anything I\'m gonna do
Anything I wanna do I do
And I don\'t have to try

Don\'t you disagree
Cause you know
It\'s all about me

Be at my beck and call
I\'m a know it all
And it\'s all your fault
I don\'t care what you\'re saying
I don\'t care what you\'re thinking
I don\'t care about anything
Get ready get ready cause I\'m happening
I don\'t care what you\'re saying
I don\'t care what you\'re thinking
I don\'t care about anything
Get ready get ready cause I\'m on the scene
I don\'t have to try
To make you realize
Anything I wanna do
Anything I\'m gonna do
Anything I wanna do I do
And I don\'t have to try

I don\'t have to try
To make you realize
Anything I wanna do
Anything I\'m gonna do
Anything I wanna do I do
And I don\'t have to try
