                        Day has gone but I'm still here with you
my sweet rose my green hills
beloved sea, lakes and sky
beloved mother earth

Silent land erase my thoughts
I would lose myself in you, whole in you
caress me and my soul while I close my eyes

On wings of destiny
through virgin skies
to far horizons I will fly

Dear peaceful land, dear mother earth
caress my soul while I close my eyes

On wings of destiny
through virgin skies
to far horizons I will fly

On wings of destiny
through virgin skies
to far horizons I will fly
                        
                    |
