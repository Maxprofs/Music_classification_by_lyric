 Chorus
 Can you keep up
 Baby boy
 Make me lose my breath
 Bring the noise
 Make me lose my breath
 Hit me hard
 Make me lose my (hah hah)
 Can you keep up
 Baby boy
 Make me lose my breath
 Bring the noise
 Make me lose my breath
 Hit me hard

 Verse 1
 Ooh, I put it right there made it easy for you to get to
 Now you wanna act like you don't know what to do
 After I done did everything that you asked me
 Grabbed you, grind you, liked you tried you
 Move so fast baby now I can't find you

 Ooh, I'm starting to believe that I'm way to much for you
 All that talk and it seems like you can't come through
 All them nights like you could satisfy me
 Now I see where believing you got me
 Gave you the wheel but you can't drive me

 Chorus

 Verse 2
 Ooo, two things I don't like when I'm trying to get my groove
 Is a partner who meets mo only halfway I just can't prove
 Take me out so deep when you know you can't swim
 Need a lifegurad and I need protection
 To put on me in the right direction

 Ooo, do you understand the facts that I'm trying to give to you
 You moving so slow like you just don't have a clue
 Didn't mama teach you to give affection
 I know the difference from a man and an adolescent
 Ain't you boo so get to stepping

 Chorus repeats 2x's

 Bridge
 If you can't make me say ooo
 Like the beat of this drum
 Why you ask for some, you ain't really want none
 If you can't make me say ooo
 Like the beat of this groove
 You don't have no business in this
 Here's your papers baby you are dismissed, dismissed, dismissed, dismissed, dismissed, dismissed

 Repeat chorus 4x's
