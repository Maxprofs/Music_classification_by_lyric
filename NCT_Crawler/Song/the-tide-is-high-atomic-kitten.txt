                        Never give up
Yeah, Yeah
Never give up

The tide is high but I'm holding on
I'm gonna be your number one
I'm not the kinda girl who gives up just like that
oh no

It's not the things you do to try and hurt me so
but it's the way you do the things you do for me
I'm not the kinda girl who gives up just like that (no)
oh no

* CHORUS *
The tide is high but I'm holding on
I'm gonna be your number one (tide)
The tide is high but I'm holding on
I'm gonna be your number one (ooh)
Number one (my number one)
Number one

Every girl wants you to be her men,
But I'll wait right here 'til it's my turn,
I'm not the kind of girl who gives up just like that
oh no

* CHORUS *
The tide is high but I'm holding on
I'm gonna be your number one (tide is high)
The tide is high but I'm holding on
I'm gonna be your number one (ooh)
Number one (my number one)
Number one

Everytime that I get the feeling
You give me something to believe in
Everytime that i got you near me
i know the way that i want it to be
But you know im gonna take my chance now
I'm gonna make it happen somehow
And you know i can take the pressure
A moment's pain for a lifetime's pleasure

Every girl wants you to be her men,
But i'll wait right here till it's my turn
I'm not the kinda girl who gives up just like that
Oh no (not gonna make it)

* CHORUS *
the tide is high but I'm holding on (yeah)
I'm gonna be you're number one (yeah)
the Tide is high but I'm holding on
I'm gonna be you're number one (the tide is high and going on)


Everytime that I get the feeling
You give me something to believe in
And everytime that i got you near me
I know the way i want it to be
But you know im gonna take my chance now
Im gonna make it happen somehow
And you know i can take the pressure
A moment's pain for a lifetimes pleasure

The tide is high but I'm holding on
I'm gonna be you're number one
