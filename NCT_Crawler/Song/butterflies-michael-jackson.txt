All you gotta do is
Just walk away and
Pass me by
Don't acknowledge my smile
When I try to say
Hello to you, yeah
And all you gotta do is
Not answer my calls when
I'm trying to get through
To keep me wondering why
When all I can do is sigh
I just wanna touch you
I just wanna touch and kiss
And I wish that
I could be with you tonight
You give me butterflies inside
Inside and I
All I gotta say is that
I must be dreaming
Can't be real
You're not here with me
Still I can feel you near me
I caress you
Let you taste us
Just so blissful listen
I would give you anything baby
Just make my dreams come true
Oh baby you give me butterflies
I just wanna touch and kiss
And I wish that
I could be with you tonight
You give me butterflies inside
Inside and I
I just wanna touch and kiss
And I wish that
I could be with you tonight
You give me butterflies inside
Inside and I
If you would take my hand
Baby I would show you
Guide you to the light babe
If you would be my love
Baby I will love you, love you
Till the end of time
I just wanna touch and kiss
And I wish that
I could be with you tonight
You give me butterflies inside
Inside and I
I just wanna touch and kiss
And I wish that
I could be with you tonight
You give me butterflies inside
Inside and I
I just wanna touch and kiss
And I wish that
I could be with you tonight
You give me butterflies inside
Inside and I
I just wanna touch and kiss
And I wish that
I could be with you tonight
You give me butterflies inside
Inside and I
