                        I can't give you anything but love, baby
 That's the only thing I've plenty of, baby
 Dream awhile, scheme awhile, you're sure to find
 Happiness and I guess, all those things you've always pined for Gee I'd like to see you looking swell, Tony
 With diamond watches Tiffany's just don't sell, baby
 Until that lucky day you know darn well
 Oh, I can't give you anything but love I can't give you anything but love, lady
 That's the only thing I've plenty of, lady
 Dream awhile, scheme awhile, you're sure to find
 Happiness and I guess, all the things you've always pined for I'd like to see you looking swell, lady
 Diamond bracelets Woolworth doesn't sell, Gaga
 Till that lucky day you know darn well, baby
 Oh, I can't give you anything
 I don't want just anything
 Oh, I can't give you anything but love
