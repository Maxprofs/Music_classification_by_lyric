                        Bài hát: Perfect Two - Auburn

You can the peanut butter to jelly
you can be the butterflies i feel in my belly
you can can be the captain
i can be your first mate
you can be the chills thats i feel on our first date

you can be the hero
i can be your side kick
you can be the tear
that i cry if we ever split
You can be the rain from the cloud when its stormin
or u can be the sun when it shines in the mornin

b sec

dont know if i could ever be
w/out u cause boy u complete me
and in time i know that we'll both see
that we're all we need

Cause your the apple to my pie
your th straw to my berry
your the smoke to my high
and your the one i wanna marry

hook

Cause your the one for me for me (for me)
and im the one for you for u (for u)
u take th both of us of us (of us)
and were the perfect two

were the perfect two
were the perfect two
baby me and you
were the perfect two

verse2

You can be the prince and i can be your princess
you can be the sweet tooth i can be the dentist
You can be the shoes and i can be the laces
you can be the heart that i spill on the pages

you can be the vodka and i can be the chaser
you can be the pencil and i can be the paper

You can be as cold as the winter weather
but i dont care as long as were together

You know that ill never doubt ya
and you know that i think about ya
and you know i cant live without ya

I love the way that u smile
and maybe in just a while
i can see me walk down the aisle
