                        Bài hát: For The First Time In Forever (Reprise) - Idina Menzel, Kristen Bell

Anna: You don’t have to protect me, I’m not afraid! 

Anna: 
Please don’t shut me out again, 
Please don’t slam the door 
You don’t have to keep your distance anymore 

'Cuz for the first time in forever, 
I finally understand 
For the first time in forever, 
We can fix this hand in hand 

We can head down this mountain together 
You don’t have live in fear 
'Cuz for the first time in forever, 
I will be right here 

Elsa:Anna 

Elsa: 
Please go back home, your life awaits 
Go enjoy the sun and open up the gates 

Anna: Yeah, but — 

Elsa: I know 

Elsa: 
You mean well, but leave me be 
Yes, I’m alone, but I’m alone and free 
Just stay away and you’ll be safe from me 

Anna (Elsa): 
Actually we’re not (What do you mean you’re not?) 
I get the feeling you don’t know (What do I not know?) 
Arendelle’s in deep, deep, deep, deep snow 

Elsa: What?! 

Anna: You’ve kind of set off an eternal winter.. everywhere 

Elsa: Everywhere? 

Anna: Well, it’s okay, you can just unfreeze it 

Elsa: No, I can’t, I — I don’t know how! 

Anna: Sure you can! I know you can! 

Anna (Elsa): 
'Cuz for the first time in forever, (I'm such a fool, I can't be free) 
You don’t have to be afraid (No escape from the storm inside of me) 
We can work this out together (I can’t control the curse) 
We’ll reverse the storm you’ve made (Anna, please! You’ll only make it worse!) 

Don’t panic (There’s so much fear) 
We’ll make the sun shine bright (You’re not safe here) 
We can face this thing together (No!) 
We can change this winter weather 
And everything we’ll be — (I can’t!)
                        
                    |
