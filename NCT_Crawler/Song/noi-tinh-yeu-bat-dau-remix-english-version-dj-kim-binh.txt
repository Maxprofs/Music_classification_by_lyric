                        Bài hát: Nơi Tình Yêu Bắt Đầu (Remix English Version) - DJ Kim Bình

For how long have I known you, but still every night
I can taste the bitter on my lips
For so long that I know you, the nights just keep going on
Left me with a broken heart and tears fall.
I saw you with me again in my dream last night
Then you sat there quiet by my side
And tonight I think of you, the wind blows so cold outside
Can it be that dreams is where your love begins.

I pray to God "Oh please let it snow", to hold you in my arms
I pray to God "Oh please let it snow", to show you I need you
I wish I could freeze the hand of time, to feel the heat of love
My heart desires a dream 'caused I know, I fell in love with you
                        
                    |
