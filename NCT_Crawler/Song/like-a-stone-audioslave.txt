                        On a cobweb afternoon
 In a room full of emptiness
 By a freeway I confess
 I was lost in the pages Of a book full of death
 Reading how we'll die alone
 And if we're good we'll lay to rest
 Anywhere we want to go In your house I long to be
 Room by room patiently
 I'll wait for you there like a stone
 I'll wait for you there alone And on my deathbed I will pray
 To the Gods and the Angels
 Like a pagan to anyone
 Who will take me to Heaven To a place I recall
 I was there so long ago
 The sky was bruised
 The wine was bled
 And there you lead me on In your house I long to be
 Room by room patiently
 I'll wait for you there like a stone
 I'll wait for you there alone, alone Alone I read
 Until the day was gone
 And I sat in regret
 Of all the things I've done For all that I've blessed
 And all that I've wronged
 In dreams until my death
 I will wonder on In your house I long to be
 Room by room patiently
 I'll wait for you there like a stone
 I'll wait for you there alone, alone
                        
                    |
