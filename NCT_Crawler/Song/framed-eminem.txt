                        Bài hát: Framed - Eminem

[Verse 1]
Feeling kinky, lip syncing to Too $hort's
"Freaky Tales" (Biatch!)
Having creepy visions of whiskey drinking
Envisioning sneaking into where Christie Brinkley dwells
I know this is risky thinking but I wanna stick her like she decals
But when murdering females better pay attention to these details
Or you could be derailed, better wear at least three layers
Of clothing or be in jail
If you get scratched because your DNA'll
Be all up under her fingernails
Man he hears you I don't think he cares
He gives a *** even his pinky swears
Three personalities burstin' out of me, please, beware
Her TV blares, can't hear the creaking stairs
She's unaware in no underwear she's completely bare
Turns around and screams I remember distinctly
I said "I'm here to do sink repairs."
Chop her up put her body parts in front of Steven Avery's trailer
And leave 'em there

[Chorus]
But hey man I was framed
I know what this looks like officers please just give me one minute
I think I can explain
I ain't murder nobody I know these words are so nutty
But I'm just here to entertain
How come your shirt is so bloody?
There's a missing person, so what he's got nothing to do with me
I'm almost certain I was framed

[Verse 2]
Woke up it was dawn, must a knew something was wrong
Think I'm becoming a monster 'cause of the drugs that I'm on
Donald Duck's on as the Tonka Truck in the yard
But dog how the *** is Ivanka Trump in the trunk of my car
Gotta get to the bottom of it to try to solve it
Must go above and beyond, 'cause it's incumbent upon
Me, 'cause I feel somewhat responsible for the dumb little blonde girl
That mother***in' baton twirler that got dumped in the pond
Second murder with no recollection of it
Collecting newspaper articles, cutting up sections from it
Memory is too ***ed to remember destructive temper cut my public defender's jugular
Then stuck him up in the blender
Another dismembered toddler
Discovered this winter probably
'Cause the disassembled body
Was covered up in the snow since the month of November oddly
I'm going in for questioning
Them son of a bitches probably just wanna pin this on me

[Chorus]
But hey man I was framed
I know what this looks like officers please just give me one minute
I think I can explain
I murdered nobody I know these words are so nutty
But I'm just here to entertain
How come your shirt is so bloody?
There's a missing person, so what he's got nothing to do with me
I'm almost certain I was framed

[Verse 3]
Still on the loose they
Spotted me inside McDonald's, Tuesday
In a Toronto Blue Jays cap looking like your college roommate
With Rihanna, Lupe, Saddam Hussein, Bobby Boucher
Or was it Cool J the cops is on a goose chase
Just escaped from the state pen for raping eight women who hate men
Don't make it no weirder I'm naked when I break in your basement
Under your babies play pen I lay and wait adjacent facing the door remaining patient
While staying complacent blatant
Sexual implications are continuing to get thrown
Insinuations are placed in little riddles and poems
Left on your pillow in hopes that when you get home
You'll get the hint ho, I'm in your window
But it never occurred to me I could describe a murder scene
In a verse and be charged with first degree
Cause it just happened to match up perfectly
With the massacre or the Burger King burglary
No officer you see I was framed

[Chorus]
I know what this looks like officers please just give me one minute
I think I can explain
I murdered nobody I know these words are so nutty
But I'm just here to entertain
How come your shirt is so bloody?
There's a misssing person, so what he's got nothing to do with me
I'm almost certain I was framed
                        
                    |
