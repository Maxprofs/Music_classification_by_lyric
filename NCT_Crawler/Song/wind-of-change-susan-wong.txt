                        Bài hát: Wind of change - Susan Wong

Wind of change until the end
You will see that I will be your friend
If you believe I'm heaven-sent
Stay and I'll forever be your friend

You're my lover and my man
You can see the writing in the sand
Lover as it's in the air
I will hold you and we'll be a pair

Standing at heaven turn
You must be heaven-sent
Dreams must be made of this

I just can't let go
I just have to hold your hand

You will ever and forever be my man
and I will ever and forever be your friend
So this will be true my love for you
Time will then forever take a stand

You must ever and forever be a friend
I have this feeling that will never can pretend

Together we'll be strong, this can't be wrong
And dream like these were meant for us to hold

We'll always be so
                        
                    |
