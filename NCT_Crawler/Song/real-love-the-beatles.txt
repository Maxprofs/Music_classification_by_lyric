                        All my little plans and schemes,
lost like some forgotten dreams,
seems that all I really was doing
was waiting for you.
Just like little girls and boys,
playing with their little toys.
Seems like all they really were doing
was waiting for love.
Don't need to be alone,
no need to be alone.
It's real love, it's real.
Yes it's real love, it's real.
From this moment on I know
exactly where my life will go.
Seems that all I really was doing
was waiting for love.
Don't need to be afraid,
no need to be afraid.
It's real love, it's real.
Yes it's real love, it's real.
Thought I'd been in love before,
but in my heart, I wanted more.
Seems like all I really was doing
was waiting for you.
Don't need to be alone,
don't need to be alone.
It's real love, it's real.
It's real love, it's real.
Yes it's real love, it's real.
It's real love, it's real.
Yes it's real love, it's real.
It's real love, it's real.
Yes it's real love, it's real.
It's real love, it's real.
