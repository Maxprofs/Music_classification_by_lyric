Unfinished Kotoko Accel world ED01 ending 1 Lyrics English Translation


Translated By Kader


English Lyrics Translation


Faster... To where you are..
My praying voice continues on echoing
I look for the meaning behind moving on and enduring the pain, Now
I speed up

(we are tossed by the waves of pain and tears
I'm tossed into the fray
tossed by various fortune
wake up your brain!
flashed in the sky
It's a burst of sensation)

A world of stagnation and resignation which brought about carefree-ness
Since when did this happen I wonder
I even forgot my own voice
The scenery you kneeled before me to offer
The monochrome morning, suddenly begin to shine


-The desire for everything to stay the same
-Us, who live in times that change
The real voices..
Dreams unable to be spoken of..
To the skies connected with you, make them resound

Stronger... with both of these hands
When I wiped all of my tears
I'll mutter "This time for sure...."
And I won't let these scars be for nothing
Someday, to the place you've shown
Even if my weak wings seemed as if they'd burn
I'd open my mouth and from the depths of my mind
I'll speed up to "Reality"

(we are tossed by the waves of pain and tears
I'm tossed into the fray
tossed by various fortune
wake up your brain!
flashed in the sky
It's a burst of sensation)

what are you looking at? Your eyes, looking at the empty skies
Your shoulders, frigid, seemed like it quivered

It seems just a tiny bit like it'll disappear but
Something I want to protect.... I certainly have one
In a virtual town, on an ordinary unstable day,
There's only one thing in which to believe!

Even deeper, let me feel them
The hearts that come alive
With myself's self, and then, let me touch it
I want to acquire these senses
What to request, what to forgive
How much should I hold on to moving moving forward
The possibilities of awakening
Passing them around, I speed up

For me you cried
I want to make your eyes smile
Closer... Deeper..
I'll take the heat, and progress

Stronger... with both of these hands
When I wiped all of my tears
I'll mutter "This time for sure...."
And I won't let these scars be for nothing
Faster.. to be by your side
Let's say my wings seemed like they'd tear off
Running through the distorted world
Beyond even senses
With "Reality", I speed up

(we are tossed by the waves of pain and tears
I'm tossed into the fray
tossed by various fortune
wake up your brain!
flashed in the sky
It's a burst of sensation)

(we are tossed by the waves of pain and tears
I'm tossed into the fray
tossed by various fortune
wake up your brain!
flashed in the sky
It's a burst of sensation)
