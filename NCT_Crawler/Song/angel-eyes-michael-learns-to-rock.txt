                        She blinded me with her light
It's such a beautiful sight
The way she moves like an angel
She's got me walking on air

Angel eyes
Rays of hope that hypnotise
They're a blessing in disguise
Lightning up my life

We can play
in our secret hideaway
We can go there everyday
Time is on our side

She blinded me with her light
It's such a beautiful sight
The way she moves like an angel
She's got me walking on air

Angel eyes
There will be no compromise
now that I have realised
what they mean to me
Oh year...

She blinded me with her light
It's such a beautiful sight
The way she moves like an angel
She's got me walking on air

She brought heaven to me
just like a symphony
The way she talks like an angel
A language out of this world 

I'm not a superstitious mind
not the spiritual kind
But she became a revalation to me
She made me believe 

She blinded me with her light
It's such a beautiful sight
The way she moves like an angel
She's got me walking on air

She brought heaven to me
just like a symphony 
The way she talks like an angel
A language out of this world 

Outro:
She's the sun that makes the rainbow
She's the blue sky when it's cloudy in my mind
She's the thunder, she's the lightning
She's the weather that keeps blowing throughout time.
