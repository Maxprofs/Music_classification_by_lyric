                        [Nicki Minaj]
Spirit of Marilyn calling me, audibly
Bawling she, said that she would never leave
Continued to torture me
Telling me to come with her
Underneath my comforter
And she brought a gun with her
Pills and some rum with her
Tip me on the balcony telling me to jump with her
Yeah I’m in the ghost but I ain’t doing stunts with her
I ain’t tryna be that haters wanna see that
But I got ‘em aggy cause I win the gold like Gabby

[Alicia Keys]
She’s just a girl and she’s on fire
Hotter than a fantasy, longer like a highway
She’s living in a world and it’s on fire
Fill with catastrophe, but she know she can fly away

Oh, she got both feet on the ground
And she’s burning it down
Oh, she got her head in the clouds
And she’s not backing down

[Chorus]
This girl is on fire
This girl is on fire
She’s walking on fire
This girl is on fire

[Alicia Keys]
Looks like a girl but she’s a flame
So bright she can burn your eyes
Better look the other way
You can try but you’ll never forget her name
She’s on top of the world
Hottest of the hottest girls say

Oh, we got our feet on the ground
And we’re burning it down
Oh, got our head in the clouds
And we’re not coming down

[Chorus]
This girl is on fire
This girl is on fire
She’s walking on fire
This girl is on fire

[Alicia Keys]
Everybody stands as she goes by
Cause they can see the flame that’s in her eyes
Watch her when she’s lighting up the night
Nobody knows that she’s a lonely girl
And it’s a lonely world
But she gon’ let it burn baby burn baby

[Nicki Minaj]
Dear God, If you’re here God
Make the fire disappear when they stare God
Take away my fear when they interfere God
Do you fear God? Cause I fear God
And in my backyard, that’s a deer, God
And that’s a horse ranch
And to my core fans keep repping me
Do it to the death of me
X in the box cause ain’t nobody checking me

[Chorus]
This girl is on fire
This girl is on fire
She’s walking on fire
This girl is on fire

Oh, oh, oh...

She’s just a girl, and she’s on fire
                        
                    |
