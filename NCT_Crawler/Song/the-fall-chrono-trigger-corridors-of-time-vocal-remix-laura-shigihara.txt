                        Bài hát: The Fall (Chrono Trigger -Corridors of Time vocal remix) - Laura Shigihara

I wake from this dream, but I can't tell you the things that I've seen
I'd leave it behind, if I could just change her mind
I can't believe, the things that you are telling me

But something deep inside makes me feel this really isn't a paradise

Familiar to me, did you cross over an eternity
We're both so alone, a warmth that we'd never known
So stay with me, before our world starts crumbling

Cuz something deep inside makes me feel this really isn't a paradise

I'm falling asleep, all the promises that I meant to keep
The sweetest of dreams, was my life just taken from me?
If I return, If I could change from what I've learned

We'd never have to hide, everything would be alright 
in this paradise
                        
                    |
