                        Hard to find a way to get through, it's a tragedy
Pulling at me like the stars do, you're like gravity
Even if the wind blows
It makes it hard to believe

How you gonna love, how you gonna feel?
How you gonna live your life like the dream you have is real?
If you lost your way, I will keep you safe
We'll open up all the world inside, see it come alive tonight

I will keep you safe

Doesn't even matter to you to see what I can see
I'm crawling on the floor to reach you, I'm a wreck you see
When you're far from home now
Makes it hard to believe

So how you gonna love, how you gonna feel?
How you gonna live your life like the dream you have is real?
If you lost your way, I will keep you safe
We'll open up all your world inside 'til you come alive tonight

I will keep you safe

We all fall down
We all feel down
'Cause rainy days and summer highs
The more we pray the more we feel alive

How you gonna love, how you gonna feel?
How you gonna live your life like the dream you have is real?

How you gonna love, how you gonna feel?
How you gonna live your life like the dream you have is real?
If you lost your way, I will keep you safe
We'll open up all your world inside so you come alive tonight

I will keep you safe
I will keep you safe
I will keep you safe
