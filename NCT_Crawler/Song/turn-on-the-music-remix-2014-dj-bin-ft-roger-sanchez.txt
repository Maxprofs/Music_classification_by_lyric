Feel that sound! (6x)

Well I I've been waiting long enough
Hey DJ please won't you turn it up
Wanna feel that base, yeah
Cause I get a rush
And when it comes, I can't get enough

So turn on the music
Why don't you turn on the music
Oh know how to use it
When you turn on the music, music, yeah!

Think it's time you turn on the music
Feel that sound rushing over me
Cause every time you turn on the music
I can't control what comes over me

Think it's time you turn on the music
Feel that sound rushing over me
Cause every time you turn on the music
I can't control what comes over me

Think it's time you turn on the music
Feel that sound rushing over me
Cause every time you turn on the music
I can't control what comes over me

Feel that sound washing over me, yeah!
Can you feel it now!

Think it's time you turn on the music
Feel that sound rushing over me
Cause every time you turn on the music
I can't control what comes over me

Think it's time you turn on the music
Feel that sound rushing over me
Cause every time you turn on the music
I can't control what comes over me

You know I feel it
When I'm out on the floor
The rhythm starts to take a hold
It goes right to my body
Right down to my soul
I think my minds gonna overload

So turn up the music
Why don't you turn up the music
Oh, you know how to use
You gotta turn up the music, music , yeah

Feel that sound rushing over me
Cause every time you turn on the music
I can't control what comes over me
