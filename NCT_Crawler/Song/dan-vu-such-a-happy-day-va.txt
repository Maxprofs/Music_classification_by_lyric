                        Bài hát: Dân Vũ - Such A Happy Day - V.A

Been looking at the sky, for a little while.
Watch the clouds roll by, and I start to smile.
And as a plane flies past, I give a friendly wave. Hello...!
And then I think about you.
What a happy day!

And I fly, fly, fly, like a pilot.
I'm as strong, strong, strong as a lion.
I'm as high, high, high as a mountain...
...in the sky - ay, ay, ay!

And I jump, jump, jump like a kangaroo.
I swim, swim, swim to be close to you.
I shake, shake, shake you by the hand.
We'll be friend, till the end...

This is such a happy day!
Sha la la la la...
This is such a happy day!
Sha la la la la...
Hey! What a happy day!
Sha la la la la...
This is such a happy day!
Sha la la la la...

And I fly, fly, fly, like a pilot.
I'm as strong, strong, strong as a lion.
I'm as high, high, high as a mountain...
...in the sky - ay, ay, ay!

And I jump, jump, jump like a kangaroo.
I swim, swim, swim to be close to you.
I shake, shake, shake you by the hand.
We'll be friend, till the end...

This is such a happy day!
Sha la la la la...
This is such a happy day!
Sha la la la la...
Hey! What a happy day!
Sha la la la la...
This is such a happy day!
Sha la la la la...

And I fly, fly, fly, like a pilot.
I'm as strong, strong, strong as a lion.
I'm as high, high, high as a mountain...
...in the sky - ay, ay, ay!

And I jump, jump, jump like a kangaroo.
I swim, swim, swim to be close to you.
I shake, shake, shake you by the hand.
We'll be friend, till the end...

This is such a happy day!
Sha la la la la...
This is such a happy day!
Sha la la la la...
Hey! What a happy day!
Sha la la la la...
This is such a happy day!
Sha la la la la...
