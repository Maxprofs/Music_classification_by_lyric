                        Bài hát: Run Away With Me - Omar Akram

I've been thinkin' 'bout you all night
I've been wanting you all day
If I could get you in my arms tonight
This is what I'd say...

I can't escape the way you make feel
Emotions outta control this must be real
This must be love oo oo oo
This must be love

I got what you want, you got what I need
So come on baby, runaway with me
You're all that I want
You're all that I need
Now come on baby runaway with me
I got what you want
You got what I need (baby runaway with me)
So come on baby
Runaway with me (baby runaway with me)

I've been waiting bout you all night
I've been wanting you all day
I gotta have you in my arms tonight
Come on let's get away

I can't escape the way you make feel
Emotions outta control this must be real
This must be love oo oo oo
This must be love

I got what you want, you got what I need
So come on baby, runaway with me
You're all that I want
You're all that I need
Now come on baby runaway with me
I got what you want
You got what I need (baby runaway with me)
So come on baby
Runaway with me (baby runaway with me)

I got what you want, you got what I need
So come on baby, runaway with me
You're all that I want
You're all that I need
Now come on baby runaway with me
I got what you want
You got what I need (baby runaway with me)
So come on baby
Runaway with me (baby runaway with me)
