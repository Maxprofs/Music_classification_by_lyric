ANA JOHNSSON-WHAT IF
LYRICS FROM LYRICS.TIME
UPDATED BY NIETZ

Couldn't move a mountain but, what if
Couldn't be an angel nor a goddess
There's so many stories we'd loVE to believe
But all I ever can be is me
There's a devil inside us all
But I believe in the beautiful

We can't change today
Undo yesterday
Make it go away
But what if
When tommorow comes
We could be the ones
Who make miracles
What if

Saw you on the news today, crying
I just wanna turn you off, keep denying
Waiting for a wind to change to pull me right in
And while I'm waiting you're under my skin

We can't change today
Undo yesterday
Make it go away
But what if
When tommorow comes
We could be the ones
Who make miracles
What if
There's a devil inside us all
I still believe in the beautiful
(what if)

We can't change today
Undo yesterday
Make it go away
But what if
When tommorow comes
We could be the last
Who make miracles
What if

We can't change today
Undo yesterday
Make it go away
But what if
When tommorow comes
We could be the last
Who make miracles
What if
We can't change today
Undo yesterday
Make it go away
But what if
Couldn't save the world today...
But what if...
