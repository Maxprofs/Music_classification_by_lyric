                        [Chorus]

I'm only one call away from you
I'm only one call away from you
And when you don't know what to do
Just pick up the phone
You know...


This isn't good bye, not even a break
I know it's not one that we wanted to take
But I'll be home, soon
I hope youll wait for me
Like I wait for you...

It's only gonna be a while (a while)
Can't be away from your smile long
No matter where I go
I won't let us go
I'm already missing my best friend...

[Chorus]

I'm only one call away from you
I'm only one call away from you
And when you don't know what to do
Just pick up the phone
You know.

I'm never too far
I'm never too far
I'm never too far, from you
I'm never too far
I'm never too far
I'm never too far, from you.

This isn't goodbye but you're crying
Wanna wipe the tears from your eyes
Girl I'm trying
To hold you down down down
But it's hard, it's so hard.

It's only gonna be a while (a while)
Can't be away from your smile long
No matter where I go
I won't let us go
I'm already missing my best friend.

[Chorus]

I'm only one call away from you
I'm only one call away from you
And when you don't know what to do
Just pick up the phone
You know.

I'm never too far
I'm never too far
I'm never too far, from you
I'm never too far
I'm never too far
I'm never too far, from you.

No one said that this would be easy
I'm missing you so much
Girl believe me
No one said that this would be easy
I'm missing my best friend...

[Chorus]

I'm only one call away from you
I'm only one call away from you
And when you don't know what to do
Just pick up the phone
You know.

I'm never too far
I'm never too far
                        
                    |
