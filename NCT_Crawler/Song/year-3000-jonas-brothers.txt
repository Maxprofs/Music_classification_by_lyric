                        Year 3000
jonas brothers

One day when I came home at lunchtime I heard a funny noise
Went out to the back yard to find out if it was one of those rowdy boys
Stood there with my neighbor called Pete and a Flux Capacitor
He told me he built a time machine
Like one in a film I've seen
Yeah he said
I've been to the year 3000
Not much has changed but they lived under water
And your great great great grand daughter
Is doing fine (doing fine)
He took me to the future in the flux thing, and I saw everything
Boy bands and another one and another one and another one
Girls there with round hair like Star Wars float above the floor
We drove around in a time machine
Like the one in the film I've seen
Yeah he said
He said I've been to the year 3000
Not much has changed but they lived under water
And your great great great grand daughter
Is doing fine (she's doing fine)
I took a trip to the year 3000
This song had gone multi-platinum
Everybody bought our 7th album
It had outsold kelly clarkson
I took a trip to the year 3000
This song had gone multi-platinum
Everybody bought our 7th album

He told me he built a time machine
Like the one in a film I've seen
Yeah
I've been to the year 3000
Not much has changed but they lived under water
And your great great great grand daughter
Is doing fine (doing fine)

He said I've been to the year 3000
Not much has changed but they lived under water
And your great great great grand daughter
Is doing fine (doing fine).
He said I've been to the year 3000
Not much has changed but they lived under water
And your great great great grand daughter
Is doing fine (she's doing fine)
He said I've been to the year 3000
Not much has changed but they lived under water
And your great great great grand daughter
Is doing fine ( doing fine)
