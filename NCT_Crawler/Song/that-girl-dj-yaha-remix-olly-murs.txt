                        Bài hát: Olly Murs《That Girl》EDM Remix By DjYaha - Olly Murs

[Intro:]
There's a girl but I let her get away
It's all my fault cause pride got in the way
And I'd be lying if I said I was ok
Anout that girl the one I let get away.

[Verse 1:]
I keep saying no
This can't be the way we're supposed to be
I keep saying no
There'ss gotta be a way to get you close to me
Now I know you gotta.

[Chorus:]
Speak up if you want somebody
Can't let him get away, oh no
You don't wanna end up sorry
The way that I'm feeling everyday
No no no no
There's no hope for the broken heart
No no no no
Theres no hope for the broken.

[Verse 2:]
There's a girl but I let her get away
Its my fault cause I said I needed space
I've been torturing myself night and day
About that girl, the one I let get away
I keep saying no
This ain't the way it's supposed to be
I keep saying no
Theres gotta be a way
There's gotta be a way
To get you close to me
You gotta.

[Chorus:]
Speak up if you want somebody
Can't let him get away, oh no
You don't wanna end up sorry
The way that I'm feeling everyday
No no no no
There's no hope for the broken heart
No no no no
Theres no hope for the broken.

[Bridge:]
No home for me
No home cause I'm broken
No room to breathe
And I got no one to bla-ame
No home for me
No home cause I'm broken
About that gir
The one I let get away.

[Chorus:]
So you better
Speak up if you want somebody
Can't let him get away no no
You dont wanna end up sorry
The way that I'm feeling everyday
Don't you know
No no no no
There's no hope for the broken heart
Don't you know
No no no no
Theres no hope for the broken
Oh
You don't wanna lose at love
It's only gonna hurt too much
I'm telling you
You don't wanna lose at love
It's only gonna hurt too much
You dont wanna lose at love
Cause There's no hope for the broken heart
Theres that girl
The one i let get away.
