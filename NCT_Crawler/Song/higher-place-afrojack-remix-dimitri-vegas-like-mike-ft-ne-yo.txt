                        Bài hát: Higher Place (Afrojack Remix) - Dimitri Vegas, Like Mike, Ne-Yo

Show me to a higher place
Take me to outer space
I want you to be my friend
We'll make it till the world ends

Show me to a higher place
Take me to outer space
I want you to be my friend
We'll make it till the world ends

Don't give me love
Governed by life
Limited by
These worldy heights
I want a love
That the universe
Can never stop
Can never hurt
I want a love that will last
After this world is our past
A love that no time could erase
A love in a higher place

Show me to a higher place
Take me to outer space
I want you to be my friend
We'll make it till the world ends

Show me to a higher place
Take me to outer space
I want you to be my friend
We'll make it till the world ends

Don't sell me short
(Don't sell me short)
On unconditional
(On unconditional)
I want a love
Beyond what we all know
Whoooooooo
I want a love that will last
After this world is our past
A love that no time could erase
A love in a higher place

Show me to a higher place
Take me to outer space
I want you to be my friend
We'll make it till the world ends

Show me to a higher place
Take me to outer space
I want you to be my friend
We'll make it till the world ends

Show me to a higher place
Take me to outer space
I want you to be my friend
We'll make it till the world ends
