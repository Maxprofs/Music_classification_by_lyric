                        [Verse:]
 Once upon another time
 Somebody's hands who felt like mine
 Turned the key and took a drive
 Was free
 Highway curved, the sun sank low
 Buckley on the radio
 Cigarette was burning slow
 So breathe

 [Chorus:]
 Just yellow lines, and tire marks
 And sun kissed skin and handle bars
 And where I stood, was where I was
 To be

 [Verse:]
 No enemies to call my own
 No porch light on to pull me home
 And where I was is beautiful
 Because I was free

 [Verse:]
 Once upon another time
 Before I knew which life was mine
 Before I left the child behind me
 I saw myself in summer nights
 And stars lit up like candle light
 I make my wish but mostly I believed

 [Chorus:]
 And yellow lines and tire marks
 Sun kissed skin and handle bars
 And where I stood, is where I was
 To be

 [Outro:]
 Once upon another time
 Decided nothing good in dying
 So I would just, I'd keep on driving
 Because I was free
                        
                    |
