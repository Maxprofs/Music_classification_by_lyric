                        Tom They say that time
 Heals everything
 But they don't know you
 And the scars you bring Max 'Cause you left a jagged hole
 And I can't stand it anymore All If heartache was a physical pain, I could face it, I could face it
 But you're hurting me from inside of my head, I can't take it, I can't take it
 I'm gonna lose my mind
 I'm gonna lose my mind Nathan I'd erase my thoughts
 If only I knew how Max Fill my head with white noise
 If it would drown you out, kill the sound All If heartache was a physical pain, I could face it, I could face it
 But you're hurting me from inside of my head, I can't take it, I can't take it
 I'm gonna lose my mind
 I'm gonna lose my mind And I'd rather be crazy, I'd rather go insane
 Than having you stalk my every thought, than having you here inside my heart If heartache was a physical pain, I could face it, I could face it
 But you're hurting me from inside of my head, I can't take it, I can't take it
 I'm gonna lose my mind
 I'm gonna lose my mind
