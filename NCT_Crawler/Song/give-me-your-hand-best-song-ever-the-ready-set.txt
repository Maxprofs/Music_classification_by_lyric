                        Bài hát: Give Me Your Hand (Best Song Ever) - The Ready Set

[Verse 1]
Dressed in your Friday best
And ready to impress, whoa-oh.
I like the show, oh oh.
And can I say that you're the prettiest girl that I know,
Or will ever know.

[Bridge 1]
So give me your hand.
Got a record on the table and I think it's gonna, gonna make you wanna let go.
An opportunity to get a little wild, baby, can I get a smile, smile, damn, I hope so.
Now we're turning up the heat, turn the shuffle to repeat, to repeat, to repeat, to repeat.

[Chorus 1]
She said, "I love this song. I've heard it before, and it stole my heart. I know every word."
She's gonna dance all night, night 'til it hurts
Singing the best song ever, best song ever!

Give me your hand!
Give me your hand!
She said, "This is the best song ever, best song ever."

[Verse 2]
Music colliding with the words singing what you wanna say.
I hope it's my name (hey hey).
And every time you hear it you'll remember this night again,
Again and again.

[Bridge 2]
So give me your hand
'Cause I'm ready and I'm able and I'm thinking' I can make you finally wanna let go.
Just to show you my affection turn the speakers up to ten and then eleven 'til we break the windows.
Now we're turning up the heat, turn the shuffle to repeat, to repeat, to repeat, to repeat!

[Chorus 2]
She said, "I love this song. I've heard it before, and it stole my heart. I know every word."
She's gonna dance all night, night 'til it hurts
Singing the best song ever, best song ever!

Give me your hand!
Give me your hand!
She said, "This is the best song ever, best song ever."

[Interlude verse]
We're not coming down.
You're all mine.
Keep you in the sound.
We're so high.
Rocket to cloud nine.
When we're turning up the best song ever,
Best song ever.

[Chorus 3]
She said, "I love this song. I've heard it before, and it stole my heart. I know every word."
She's gonna dance all night, night 'til it hurts
Singing the best song ever, best song ever!

She said, "I love this song. I've heard it before, and it stole my heart. I know every word."
She's gonna dance all night, night 'til it hurts
Singing the best song ever, best song ever!

Give me your hand!
O-whoa-o-o-o-oh-oh
Give me your hand!
She said, "This is the best song ever, best song ever."
