                        Bài hát: I Never Said - Shayne Ward 

I’m alone in the place
We called a home
Every room
Lies silent and cold
Late in the night
Going round in my head
Are the words i never said

I never knew
You were hurting inside
I can still hear your voice
Like an echoing cry
I stumble and fall
Hands to my head
Cry out the words i never said

For everything you are
I should have thanked you
For every tender touch
I should have held you
Told you i loved you
With every beat of my heart

I close my eyes
Walk through my mind
Searching the past
Of a happier time
Turn off the light
Laying on my bed
I hear the words i never said

I should have held you
Told you i loved you
With every beat of my heart

These are the words i never said
I’m sorry, got trapped in my head
These are the words i never said
I’m sorry, got trapped in my head
                        
                    |
