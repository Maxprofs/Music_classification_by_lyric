                        Can you remember when,
 We used to cry,
 But never in distress?
 Or can you picture when,
 We used to pride,
 Ourselves on neatness?

 'cause I can't understand,
 What you meant to me,
 You made me wild,
 Then you tied my hands.

 Can you remember when,
 We used to laugh,
 Bout those mistakes we made?
 Or can you picture when,
 We used to drive,
 And never reeach the end?

 But I can't understand,
 What you meant to me,
 You made me wild,
 Then you tied my hands.

 But since you went away,
 Made me find,
 I have nothing to say.

 Since you went away,
 Made me find,
 I have nothing to say.

 'cause I can't understand,
 What you meant to me,
 You made me wild,
 Then you tied my hands.

 Ohh.. Ohh..

 'cause I can't understand,
 What you meant to me,
 You made me wild,
 Then you tied my hands.

 Tied my hands.
 Mmm
 You tied my hands.
 Mmm
 You tied my hands.
 Mmm
 Tied my hands.
