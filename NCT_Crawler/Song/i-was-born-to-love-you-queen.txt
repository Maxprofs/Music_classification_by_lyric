                        I was born to love you
With every single beat of my heart
Yes, I was born to take care of you
Every single day...

Alright! Hey hey!

I was born to love you
With every single beat of my heart
Yes, I was born to take care of you
Every single day of my life

You are the one for me
I am the man for you
You were made for me
you're my ecstasy
If I was given every opportunity
I'd kill for your love

So take a chance with me
Let me romance with you
I'm caught in a dream
And my dream's come true
It's so hard to believe
This is happening to me
An amazing feelin'
Comin' through

I was born to love you
With every single beat of my heart
Yes, I was born to take care of you
Every single day of my life

I wanna love you
I love every little thing about you
I wanna love you, love you, love you
Born - to love you
Born - to love you
Yes I was born to love you
Born - to love you
Born - to love you
Every single day - of my life

An amazing feelin'
Comin' through

I was born to love you
With every single beat of my heart
Yes, I was born to take care of you
Every single day of my life

Yes I was born to love you
Every single day of my life
                        
                    |
