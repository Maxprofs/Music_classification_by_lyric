Album:The Best Damn Thing

Uh oh Uh oh
When you\'re around
I don\'t know what to do
I do not think that I can wait
To go over and to talk to you
I do not know what I should say

So I walk out in silence
That\'s when I start to realize
What you bring to my life
Damn this guy can make me cry
It\'s so contagious
I cannot get it out of my mind
It\'s so outrageous
You make me feel so high all the time

They all say that you\'re no good for me
But I\'m too close to turn around
I\'ll show them they don\'t know anything
I think I\'ve got you figured out
So I walk out in silence
That\'s when I start to realize
What you bring to my life
Damn this guy can make me smile
It\'s so contagious
I cannot get it out of my mind
It\'s so outrageous
You make me feel so high

I will give you everything
I will treat you right
If you just give me a chance
I can prove I\'m right
It\'s so contagious
I cannot get it out of my mind
It\'s so outrageous
You make me feel so high

It\'s so contagious
I cannot get it out of my mind
It\'s so outrageous
You make me feel so high
All the time
