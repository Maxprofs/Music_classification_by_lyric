                        Are you in over your head?
 Are you on water so deep your drowning?
 Do you think you've been left,
 And there is no one to feel your hurting?

 Well everybody has been there
 And everybody's felt lost
 If you're in over your head
 Lift it up
 Lift it up

 [Chorus:]
 Oh, listen to the sound of hope
 That's rising up
 Over your old horizon
 Listen to the sound
 Listen to the sound
 And listen to the sound of a new beginning of
 This is where the old is ending
 Listen to the sound
 Listen to the sound

 I hear you say your alone
 I hear you sayin' that you'll never make it
 I've got to tell you you're wrong
 Cuz I have been down this path you're taking

 You'll never know what Faith is
 Till you don't understand
 Sometimes it takes the silence
 To finally hear His plans

 [Chorus:]
 Oh, listen to the sound of hope
 That's rising up
 Over your old horizon
 Listen to the sound
 Listen to the sound
 And listen to the sound of a new beginning of
 This is where the old is ending
 Listen to the sound
 Listen to the sound

 Amazing Grace
 How sweet the sound
 I once was lost
 But now I'm found

 Amazing Grace
 How sweet the sound
 I once was lost
 But now I'm found

 [Chorus:]
 Oh, listen to the sound of hope
 That's rising up
 Over your old horizon
 Listen to the sound
 Listen to the sound
 And listen to the sound of a new beginning of
 This is where the old is ending
 Listen to the sound
 Listen to the sound

 His grace is reaching for us
 His grace is reaching out
 Listen to the sound
 Listen to the sound
 Wherever your are...

 His grace is reaching for us
 His grace is reaching out
 Listen to the sound
 Listen to the sound
 Wherever your are...
