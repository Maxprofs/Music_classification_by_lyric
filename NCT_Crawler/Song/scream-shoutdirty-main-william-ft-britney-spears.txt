Bring the action...

When you hear this in the club
You gotta turn the sh-t up
You gotta turn the sh-t up
You gotta turn the sh-t up
When we up in the club
All eyes on us
All eyes on us
All eyes on us
See the boys in the club
They watching us
They watching us
They watching us
Everybody in the club
All eyes on us
All eyes on us
All eyes on us

I wanna scream and shout, and let it all out
And scream and shout, and let it out
We saying, oh wee oh wee oh wee oh wee oh
We saying, oh wee oh wee oh wee oh wee oh
I wanna scream and shout, and let it all out
And scream and shout, and let it out
We saying, oh wee oh wee oh wee oh wee oh

You are now rocking with Will.i.am and Britney, b-tch

[beat break]

Oh yeah....
Bring the action

Rock and roll, everybody let's lose control
All the bottom we let it go
Going fast, we aint going slow, no
Hear the beat, now let's hit the floor
Drink it up, and then drink some more
Light it up, and let's let it blow
Hey yo, rock it out, rock it now
If you know what we talking 'bout
Turn it up, and burn down the house, hooouse
Hey yo, turn it up, and don't turn it down
Here we go, we gon shake the ground
Cause everywhere that we go we BRING THE ACTION

When you hear this in the club
You gotta turn the sh-t up
You gotta turn the sh-t up
You gotta turn the sh-t up
When we up in the club
All eyes on us
All eyes on us
All eyes on us
You see them girls in the club
They looking at us
They looking at us
They looking at us
Everybody in the club
All eyes on us
All eyes on us
All eyes on us

I wanna scream and shout, and let it all out
And scream and shout, and let it out
We saying, oh wee oh wee oh wee oh wee oh
We saying, oh wee oh wee oh wee oh wee oh
I wanna scream and shout, and let it all out
And scream and shout, and let it out
We saying, oh wee oh wee oh wee oh wee oh

You are now rocking with Will.i.am and Britney, b-tch

[beat break]

Oh yeah....

It goes on and on and on and on
When me and you party together
I wish this night would last forever
Cause I was feeling down, now im feeling better
And maybe it goes on and on and on and on
When me and you party together
I wish this night would last forever, ever, ever, ever

I wanna scream and shout, and let it all out
And scream and shout, and let it out
We saying, oh wee oh wee oh wee oh wee oh
We saying, oh wee oh wee oh wee oh wee oh
I wanna scream and shout, and let it all out
And scream and shout, and let it out
We saying, oh wee oh wee oh wee oh wee oh

I wanna scream and shout, and let it all out
And scream and shout, and let it out
We saying, oh wee oh wee oh

You are now rocking with Will.i.am and Britney, b-tch
