                        Yeah *****, I'm still ****in with ya
Still waters run deep
Still Snoop Dogg and D-R-E, '99 ***** (Guess who's back)
Still, still doing that ****, Andre?

Oh for sho', check me out
It's still Dre Day *****, A.K. *****
Though I've grown a lot, can't keep it home a lot
Cause when I frequent the spots that I'm known to rock
You hear the bass from the truck when I'm on the block
Ladies, they pay homage, but haters say Dre fell off
How *****? My last album was "The Chronic" (*****)
They want to know if he still got it
They say rap's changed, they want to know how I feel about it

If you ain't up on thangs

Dr. Dre is the name, I'm ahead of my game
Still, puffing my leafs, still **** with the beats
Still not loving police (Uh huh)
Still rock my khakis with a cuff and a crease (fo sho)
Still got love for the streets, repping two one three (fo life)
Still the beats bang, still doing my thang
Since I left, ain't too much changed, still

I'm representing for them gangstas all across the world
(Still) Hitting them corners on the low-low's girl

Still taking my time to perfect the beat
And I still got love for the streets, it's the D-R-E

Since the last time you heard from me I lost some friends
Well, hell, me and Snoop, we dipping again
Kept my ear to the streets, signed Eminem
He's triple platinum, doing fifty a week
Still, I stay close to the heat
And even when I was close to defeat, I rose to my feet
My life's like a soundtrack I wrote to the beat
Treat my rap like Cali weed, I smoke til I sleep
Wake up in the A.M., compose a beat
I bring the fire t
