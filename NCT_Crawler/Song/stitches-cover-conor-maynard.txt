                        Bài hát: Stitches Cover - Conor Maynard

I thought that I'd been hurt before 
But no one's ever left me quite this sore 
Your words cut deeper than a knife 
Now I need someone to breathe me back to life 

Got a feeling that I'm going under 
But I know that I'll make it out alive 
If I quit calling you my lover 
Move on 

You watch me bleed until I can't breathe 
Shaking, falling onto my knees 
And now that I'm without your kisses 
I'll be needing stitches 
Tripping over myself, 
Aching, begging you to come help 
And now that I'm without your kisses 
I'll be needing stitches 

Just like a moth drawn to a flame 
Oh, you lured me in, I couldn't sense the pain 
Your bitter heart cold to the touch 
Now I'm gonna reap what I sow 
I'm left seeing red on my own 

Got a feeling that I'm going under 
But I know that I'll make it out alive 
If I quit calling you my lover and 
Move on 

You watch me bleed until I can't breathe 
Shaking, falling onto my knees 
And now that I'm without your kisses 
I'll be needing stitches 
Tripping over myself, 
Aching, begging you to come help 
And now that I'm without your kisses 
I'll be needing stitches 

From a look to a touch, 
From a touch to a crush,
From a crush into lust,
Lust into love
Then love into us
Now that's real ***,
But love is a gun you can kill with 
Heard time is the best way to deal with 
Had time, tell me why I still feel ***?
But, that's life when you're really in love
So I guess that I'm really in love
Hit the club and i'm livin' it up
But one night stands just isn't enough 
And I gave my time,
And I gave my trust,
And I gave my heart,
And I gave my love,
And I gave my year,
And I gave my months,
I guess all i gave was just not enough
Now Anth just calm down
Anth just breathe,
Take a break and get some sleep
But tell me how can I sleep when you're the woman of my dreams?
And even though we do not speak
And even though we fell apart
You may not be in my life but you'll always be in my heart.

'cause it's too late now to say sorry babe
the one missing more than just your body
But it's too late now to say sorry babe
Yeah! i know all that i let you down 
But it's too late to say sorry now
                        
                    |
