Artist: Frank Ocean
Albums: Channel ORANGE

Too many bottles of this wine
We can't pronounce
Too many bowls of that green
No Lucky Charms
The maids come around too much
Parents ain't around enough
Too many joy rides in daddy's Jaguar
Too many white lies and white lines
Super rich kids with nothing but loose ends
Super rich kids with nothing but fake friends
Start my day up on the roof
There's nothing like this type of view
Point the clicker at the tube
I prefer expensive news
New car, new girl
New ice, new glass
New watch, good times babe
It's good times, yeah
She wash my back three times a day
This shower head feels so amazing
We'll both be high, the help don't stare
They just walk by, they must don't care
A million one, a million two
A hundred more will never do
Too many bottles of this wine
We can't pronounce
Too many bowls of that green
No Lucky Charms
The maids come around too much
Parents ain't around enough
Too many joy rides in daddy's Jaguar
Too many white lies and white lines
Super rich kids with nothing but loose ends
Super rich kids with nothing but fake friends
Real love, I'm searching for a real love
Real love, I'm searching for a real love
Oh, real love

[Earl Sweatshirt]
Alright, close your eyes for what you can't imagine
We are the Xanny gnashing, Caddy smashing, bratty ass
He mad, he snatched his daddy's Jag
And used the *** for batting practice
Adamant and he thrashing, purchasing crappy grams
With half the hand of cash you handed
Panic and patch me up, Pappy done latch keyed us
Toying with raggy annes and mammy done had enough
Brash as ***, breaching all these aqueducts
Don't believe us treat us like we can't erupt, yup

[Frank Ocean]
We end our day up on the roof
I say I'll jump, I never do
But when I'm drunk, I act a fool, talking 'bout
Do they sew wings on tailored suits?
I'm on that ledge, she grabs my arm
She slaps my head, it's good times, yeah
Sleeve rips off, I slip, I fall
The market's down like 60 stories
And some don't end the way they should
My silver spoon has fed me good
A million one, a million cash
Close my eyes and feel the crash
Too many bottles of this wine
We can't pronounce
Too many bowls of that green
No Lucky Charms
The maids come around too much
Parents ain't around enough
Too many joy rides in daddy's Jaguar
Too many white lies and white lines
Super rich kids with nothing but loose ends
Super rich kids with nothing but fake friends
Real love, ain't that something rare?
I'm searching for a real love
Talking about a real love, ah
Real love, yeah, real love, yeah
I'm searching for a real love
Talking 'bout a real love, ooh
