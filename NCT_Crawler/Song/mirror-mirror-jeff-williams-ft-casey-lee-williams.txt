                        Mirror, tell me something.

Tell me who's the loneliest, of all?

Mirror, tell me something, tell me who's the loneliest of all?

Fear of whats inside of me; tell me can a heart be turned to stone?

Mirror mirror, what's behind you? Save me from the things I see.

I can keep it from the world, why won't you let me hide from me?

Mirror mirror, tell me something- who's the loneliest of all?

I'm the loneliest of all.
