Jingle bell, jingle bell, jingle bell rock,
Jingle bells swing and jingle bells ring
Snowing and blowing in bushels of fun
Now the jingle hop has begun

Jingle bell,
jingle bell,
jingle bell rock,
Jingle bells chime in jingle bell time
Dancing and Prancing in Jingle Bell Square
In the frosty air

What a bright time
it's the right time
To rock the night away
Jingle bell time is a swell time
To go gliding in a one-horse sleigh
Giddy-up jingle horse
pick up your feet
Jingle around the clock
Mix and a-mingle in the jingling beat

That's the jingle bell rock

Jingle bell
jingle bell
jingle bell rock
Jingle bells chime in jingle bell time
Dancer and Prancer in Jingle Bell Square
In the frosty air

What a bright time
it's the right time
To rock the night away
Jingle bell time is a swell time
To go gliding in a one-horse sleigh
Giddy-up jingle horse
pick up your feet
Jingle around the clock
Mix and a-mingle in the jingling beat
That's the jingle bell,
that's the jingle bell,
that's the jingle bell rock!

You better watch out
You better not cry
Better not pout
I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is coming to town

He's making a list
And checking it twice;
He's gonna find out
Who's naughty or nice
Santa Claus is coming to town

He sees you when you're sleeping
He knows when you're awake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake!

You better watch out!
You better not cry
You better not pout
I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is coming to town

He sees you when you're sleeping
He knows when you're awake
He knows if you've been bad or good
So be good for goodness sake

You better watch out!
You better not cry
You better not pout
I'm telling you why
Santa Claus is coming to town
