                        I wasn't mean the wrong way
Won't you do me the right way?
Where you gonna be tonight?
Coz I won't stay too long!

Maybe you're the light for me
When you talk to me it strikes me
Won't somebody help me?
Coz I don't feel too strong...

Was there something that I said?
Was there something that I did?
Or the combination I broke that did me have?

You know I'm hoping you sing alone,
Though it's not your favorite song
Don't wanna be the wind just... nothing left to say
You know that someone those spin again
When you do, you need a friend
Don't wanna be the wind... just nothing left for me
And I hate the thought finally been erased
Baby that's the best of me!

Everything's behind you
But the whole place I sit besides you
Living in every moment
Have I wasted all your time?

Was there something that I said?
Was there something that I did?
Or the combination I broke that did me have?

You know I'm hoping you sing alone
Though it's not your favorite song
Don't wanna be the wind...just nothing left to say
You know that someone those spin again
When you do, you need a friend
Don't wanna be the wind just nothing left for me
And I hate the thought finally been erased
Baby that's the best of me!
Baby that's the best of me!

You know I'm hoping you sing alone
Though it's not your favorite song
Don't wanna be the wind just nothing left to say!
You know that someone those spin again
When you do, you need a friend
Don't wanna be the wind just nothing left for me
And I hate the thought finally been erased
Baby that's the best of me...
