                        Bài hát: Love The Way You Lie - Skylar Grey

On the first page of our story
The Future seem so bright
Then the thing turn out so evil
I don't know why I'm still surprised
Even Angels have their wicked schemes
And you take them to new extremes
But you'll always be my hero
Even though you've lost your mind

Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
Well that alright because I like the way it hurt
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
Well that alright because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie (x2)


Now there gravels in our voices
Glass is shattered from the fight
In this tug of war, you'll always win
Even when I'm right
Cause you feed me fables from your hand 
With violent words and empty threats
And it's sick at all these battle are what keeps me satisfied


Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
Well that alright because I like the way it hurt
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
Well that alright because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie (x2)


So maybe I'm a masochist
I tried to run but I don't wanna ever leave
Till the Walls are going up
In smoke with all our memories


Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
Well that alright because I like the way it hurt
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
Well that alright because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie (x3)
