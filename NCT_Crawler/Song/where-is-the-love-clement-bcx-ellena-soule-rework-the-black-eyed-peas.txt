                        Bài hát: Where Is The Love (Clement Bcx & Ellena Soule Rework) - The Black Eyed Peas

People killin', people dyin' 
Children hurt and you hear them cryin' 
Can you practise what you preach? 
Or would you turn the other cheek? 

Father, Father, Father help us 
Send some guidance from above 
'Cause people got me, got me questionin' 
Where is the love (Love)
                        
                    |
