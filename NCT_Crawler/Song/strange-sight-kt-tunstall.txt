                        Bài hát: Strange Sight - KT Tunstall

Do you long to be left all alone?
Set apart with a heart made of stone
There's a light that you shine
There's a love, I see it in your eyes
Every day, every night
I know time may divide
But fate is something we refuse to hide
And it's real, and it's right
Something strange out of sight
We say goodnight
                        
                    |
