                        Bài hát: Shatter Me - Lindsey Stirling, Lzzy Hale

[Verse 1 - Lzzy Hale:]
I pirouette in the dark
I see the stars through a mirror
Tired mechanical heart
Beats 'til the song disappears

[Chorus:]
Somebody shine a light
I'm frozen by the fear in me
Somebody make me feel alive
And shatter me
So cut me from the line
Dizzy, spinning endlessly
Somebody make me feel alive
And shatter me

[Violin Drop]

Shatter me!
Somebody make me feel alive
And shatter me

[Verse 2:]
If only the clockwork could speak
I wouldn't be so alone
We'd burn every magnet and spring
And spiral into the unknown

[Chorus]

[Violin Drop]

[Bridge:]
If I break the glass then I'll have to fly
There's no one to catch me if I take a dive
I'm scared of change and the days stay the same
The world is spinning but only in gray
If I break the glass then I'll have to fly
There's no one to catch me if I take a dive
I'm scared of change and the days stay the same
The world is spinning but only in gray
(Only...)

[Chorus]

[Violin Drop:]
Me...!
Shatter me!
Somebody make me feel alive
And shatter me!
                        
                    |
