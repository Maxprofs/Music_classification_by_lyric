                        (Verse one) 
He is a hustler 
He's no good at all 
He is a loser, he's a bum (bum bum bum) 
He lies, he bluffs, he's unreliable. 
He is a sucker with a gun (gun gun gun). 
I know you told me I should stay away. 
I know you said he's just a dog astray. 
He is a badboy with a tainted heart and even I know this ain't smart.

(Chorus) 
But mama I'm in love with a criminal 
and this type of love isn't rational its physical, 
mama please dont cry i will be alright, 
all reason aside i just cant deny, 
love the guy 

(verse 2) 
He is a villain of the devil's law, 
He is a killer just for fun (fun, fun, fun), 
that mans a snitch and unpredictable, 
He's got no concious he got none (none, none, none) 
All i know should let go but no 
cause he's a badboy with a tainted heart 
and even i know this aint smart 

(Chorus) 
But mama im in love with a criminal 
and this type of love isnt rational its physical, 
mama please dont cry i will be alright, 
all reason aside i just cant deny, 
love the guy 

(bridge) 
And hes got my name tattooed on his arm, his lucky charm, 
so i guess its okay, 
he's with me,
and i hear people talk (people talk) trying to make remarks, keep us apart 
but i dont even hear I dont care 

(Chorus) 
Cause mama im in love with a criminal and this type of love isnt rational its physical, mama please dont cry i will be alright, all reason aside i just cant deny, love the guy
