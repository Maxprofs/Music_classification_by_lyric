                        Nicki Minaj:]
 B-b-b-b-b bad bitch central
 Check my credentials
 Motherfucking right it's Nicki on the intro
 And I'm even bitchier when I'm on my menstral
 You ain't even got a credit card for incidental
 Basic insurance and it don't include dental,
 Dental, dental, yes bitch I'm mental
 Plus I'm in the big boy and it's not a rental
 *** ain't sweet unless it's the Presidential
 Y-Y-Y-Y-You a mut
 Tell her quack quack, she a motherfucking duck, goose
 She a saturday night live, spoof
 One thing the coupe never got, roof!
 Yeah I took the spot she gone, poof!
 Me and KC, deuce!
 Stay fly, you can call me "have a safe flight"
 And my wrist froze, stage fright
