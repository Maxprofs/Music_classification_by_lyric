                        Bài hát: Price Tag - Jessie J, B.o.B

1. Seems like every body's got a price
I wonder how they sleep at night
When the sale comes first
And the truth comes second
Just stop, for a minute and smile.

Why is everybody so serious
Acting so damn mysterious
You got your shades on your eyes
And your heels so high
That you can't even have a good time.

Everybody look to their left (yeah)
Everybody look to their right
Can you feel that (yeah)
Well playing with love tonight...

[Chorus1:]
It's not about the money, money, money
We don't need your money, money, money
We just wanna make the world change
Forget about the price tag.

Ain't about the (uh) cha-ching cha-ching
Aint about the (yeah) ba-bling ba-bling
Wanna make the world dance
Forget about the price tag.

2. We need to take it back in time
When music made us all unite
And it wasn't low blows and video hoes
Am i the only one gettin tired?

Why is everybody so obsessed
Money can't buy us happiness
If we all slow down and enjoy right now
Gurantee we'll be feelin
All right.

Everybody look to their left (yeah)
Everybody look to their right
Can you feel that (yeah)
Well playing with love tonight.

[Chorus2:]
It's not about the money, money, money
We don't need your money, money, money
We just wanna make the world dance
Forget about the price tag.

Ain't about the (uh) cha-ching cha-ching
Aint about the (yeah) ba-bling ba-bling
Wanna make the world dance
Forget about the price tag.
