                        Bài hát: Glass Bridge (Bride Of The Water God OST) - Savina & Drones

Howling moon
It has been so while
In the silence
And if you believe
In my little world
Tomorrow will have a wonder
Don't know where to go
Tell me for sure

That you won't leave me here alone
I need to know
You will I believe
When I do need someone to hold
You'll be here
Little voice I hear
Yeah maybe
Maybe no
Who to say
Slowly drowning in
After wave after wave

Who to say
Then I cross a bridge for over millions reasons to hold on
Hide away with me
Walk away with me
Then we cross a bridge for over millions troubles to meet
Nothing is easy nothing is easy

Hu ha ah ah........
Oh how will you see
How will you try, How
However I mean to you now, try
Then I cross a bridge for over millions reasons to hold on
Hide away with me
Walk away with me
Then we cross a bridge for over millions troubles to meet
Nothing is easy nothing is easy
                        
                    |
