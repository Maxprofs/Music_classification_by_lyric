                        Bài hát: Masterpiece - Jessie J

So much pressure
Why so loud?
If you don't like my sound
You can turn it down

I got a road
And I walk it alone

Uphill battle
I look good when I climb
I'm ferocious, precocious
I get braggadocios

I'm not gonna stop
I like the view from the top

You talk that blah blah, that la-la, that rah-rah sh*t
And I'm so done, I'm so over it
Sometimes I mess up, I f-up up, I hit and miss
But I'm okay, I'm cool with it

I still fall on my face sometimes
And I can't color inside the lines
'Cause I'm perfectly incomplete
I'm still working on my masterpiece
And I, I wanna hang with the greats
Got a way to go, but it's worth the wait
No, you haven't seen the best of me
I'm still working on my masterpiece

Those who mind don't matter
Those who matter, don't mind
If you don't catch what I'm throwing
Then I leave you behind

Don't need a flash
And I ain't living like that

They talk that blah blah, that la-la that rah-rah sh*t
Go with the punches, and take the hits
Sometimes I mess up, I f-up up, I swing and miss
But it's okay, I'm cool with it

I still fall on my face sometimes
And I can't color inside the lines
'Cause I'm perfectly incomplete
I'm still working on my masterpiece
And I, I wanna hang with the greats
Got a way to go, but it's worth the wait
No, you haven't seen the best of me
I'm still working on my masterpiece

I still fall on my face sometimes
And I can't color inside the lines
'Cause I'm perfectly incomplete
I'm still working on my masterpiece
Masterp iece, masterpiece

I still fall on my face sometimes
And I can't color inside the lines
'Cause I'm perfectly incomplete
I'm still working on my masterpiece
And I, I wanna hang with the greats
Got a way to go, but it's worth the wait
No, you haven't seen the best of me
I'm still working on my masterpiece
                        
                    |
