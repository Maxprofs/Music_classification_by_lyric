                        Bài hát: Talking To The Moon - Bruno Mars

I know you're somewhere out there 
Somewhere far away 
I want you back 
I want you back 

My neighbors think 
I'm crazy 
But they don't understand 
You're all I have 
You're all I have 

Chorus: 
At night when the stars ....light up my room 
I sit by myself 

Talking to the Moon .....
Try to get to You .....
In hopes you're on the other side 
Talking to me too or am I a fool 
who sits alone 
Talking to the moon 

ho oh oh oh oh

I'm feeling like I'm famous 
The talk of the town 
they....I've gone mad 
I've gone mad 
But they don't know 
what I know 

Cause when the sun goes down someone's talking back 
Yeah they're talking back 
oh....

At night when the stars ....light up my room 
I sit by myself 

Chorus:

Talking to the Moon 
Try to get to You 
In hopes you're on 
the other side 
Talking to me too 
Or am I a fool 
who sits alone 
Talking to the moon 

Do you ever hear me calling? 
ah hooo.....ah hooo

Cause every night 
I'm talking to the moon 
Still trying to get to you 

In hopes you're on the other side 
Talking to me too 
Or am I a fool 
who sits alone 
Talking to the moon
                        
                    |
