                        Bài hát: Dead And Gone - Justin Timberlake

Oh
I've been travellin' on this road too long
Just tryna find my way back home
The old me is dead and gone, dead and gone
Oh oh

Ever had one of them days wish would've stayed home
Run into a group of suckers trying to get they hate on
You walk by
They get wrong
You reply then *** get blown
Way outta proportion
Way past discussion
Just you against them, pick one then rush 'em
Figure you'll get jumped, hell that's nothing
They don't wanna stop there now they bussin'
Now you gushin', ambulance rushin'
You to the hospital with a bad concussion
Hit 4 times plus it hit your spine
Paralyzed waist down now ya wheel chair bound
Nevermind that now you lucky to be alive
Just think it all started you fussin' with 3 guys
Now ya pride in the way, but ya pride is the way
You could mess around, get shot, die any day
People die everyday all over bull ***, 
Dope money, dice game, ordinary hood ***
Could this be 'cos of hip hop music?
Or did the ones with the good sense not use it?
Usually people don't know what to do 
When their back against the wall so they just start shootin'
For red or for blue or for blo I guess
From Bankhead or from your projects
No more stress, now I'm straight, 
Now I get it, now I take
Time to think, before I make mistakes just for my family's sake
That part of me left yesterday
The heart of me is strong today
No regrets I'm blessed to say
The old me dead and gone away

Oh
I've been travellin' on this road too long
Just tryna find my way back home
The old me is dead and gone, dead and gone
Oh oh

I ain't never been scared, I lived through tragedy
Situation could've been dead lookin' back at it
Most of that *** didn't even have to happen
But you don't think about it when you out there trappin'
In apartments, hangin', smokin', and rappin'
Suckers start ***, next thing ya know we cappin'
Get locked up then didn't even get mad
Now think about damn what a life I had
Most of that ***, look back, just laugh
Some *** still look back get sad
Maybe my homeboy still be around
Had I not hit the sucker in the mouth that time
I won that fight, I lost that war
I can still see my homie walkin' out that door
Who'da thought I'd never see Philant no more?
Got enough dead homies I don't want no more
Cost a sucker his job cost me more
I'd took that ass-whooping now for sure
Now I think before I risk my life
Take them chances to get my stripe
A sucker put his hands on me alright
Otherwise stand there talk *** all night
'Cos I hit you, you sue me,
I shoot you, get locked up, who me?
No more stress, now I'm straight, 
Now I get it, now I take
Time to think, before I make mistakes just for my family's sake
That part of me left yesterday
The heart of me is strong today
No regrets I'm blessed to say
The old me dead and gone away

Oh
I've been travellin' on this road too long
Just tryna find my way back home
The old me is dead and gone, dead and gone
Oh oh

I turn my head to the East
I don't see nobody by my side
I turn my head to the West
Still nobody in sight
So I turn my head to the North
Swallow that pill that they call pride
That old me is dead and gone
But that new me will be alright

I turn my head to the East
I don't see nobody by my side
I turn my head to the West
Still nobody in sight
So I turn my head to the North
Swallow that pill that they call pride
That old me is dead and gone
But that new me will be alright

Oh
I've been travellin' on this road too long
Just tryna find my way back home
The old me is dead and gone, dead and gone (But that new me will be alright)
Oh oh
Oh
I've been travellin' on this road too long (But that new me will be alright)
Just tryna find my way back home (But that new me will be alright)
The old me is dead and gone, dead and gone (But that new me will be alright)
Oh oh
