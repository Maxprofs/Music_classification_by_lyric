                        Bài hát: Stay A While (Ummet Ozcan Remix) - Dimitri Vegas & Like Mike

When these stars, start to fall
Will you love me, will you call
I need you close, don’t run away
Don’t run away
Chasing highs, in the midnight sun
We fought for love, we were on the run
Tried my best, to give you what you need
So one more chance, please don’t leave

Made it way past broken hearts
Won't you stay a while?
Stay a while
We are still on the run
Never had enough
Never catching us

Never catching us [x2]

All these lights, got me in a daze
I've been lost, haven't slept in days
I need you close, don't run away
Don't run away
I want you by my side
I hope you never leave
I'll just keep holding on
I'll just be all you need
This life is all we know
This life is all we know

Made it way past broken hearts
Won't you stay a while?
Stay a while
We are still on the run
Never had enough
Never catching us

Never catching us [x2]

Made it way past broken hearts
Won't you stay a while?
Stay a while
We are still on the run
Never had enough
Never catching us

Made it way past broken hearts
Won't you stay a while?
Stay a while
We are still on the run
Never had enough
Never catching us
