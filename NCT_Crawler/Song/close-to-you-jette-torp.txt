                        Bài hát: Close To You - Jette Torp

Why do birds suddenly appear 
Every time you are near? 
Just like me, they long to be 
Close to you. 

Why do stars fall down from the sky 
Every time you walk by? 
Just like me, they long to be 
Close to you. 

On the day that you were born 
And the angels got together 
And decided to create a dream come true 
So they sprinkled moon dust 
In your hair of gold and starlight in your eyes of blue. 

That is why all the girls in town 
Follow you all around 
Just like me, they long to be 
Close to you. 

On the day that you were born 
And the angels got together 
And decided to create a dream come true 
So they sprinkled moon dust 
In your hair of gold 
And starlight in your eyes of blue. 

That is why all the girls in town 
Follow you all around 
Just like me, they long to be 
Close to you. 

Just like me, they long to be 
Close to you. 

Wa, close to you 
Wa, close to you 
Ha, close to you 
La, close to you
                        
                    |
