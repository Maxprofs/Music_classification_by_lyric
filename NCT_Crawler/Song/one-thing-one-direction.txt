                        [Liam] I've tried playing it cool 
But when I'm looking at you 
I can never be brave 
Cause you make my heart race 

[Harry] Shot me out of the sky 
You're my kryptonite 
You keep making me weak 
Yeah, frozen and can't breathe 

[Zayn] Some things gotta give now 
Cause I'm dying just to make you see 
That I need you here with me now 
Cause you've got that one thing 

[All] So get out, get out, get out of my head 
And fall into my arms instead 
I don't, I don't, don't know what it is 
But I need that one thing 
And you've got that one thing 

[Niall] Now I'm climbing the walls 
But you don't notice at all 
That I'm going out of my mind 
All day and all night 

[Louis] Some things gotta give now 
Cause I'm dying just to know your name 
And I need you here with me now 
Cause you've got that one thing 

[All] So get out, get out, get out of my head 
And fall into my arms instead 
I don't, I don't, don't know what it is 
But I need that one thing 
So get out get out get out of my mind 
And come on come into my life 
I don't I don't don't know what it is 
But I need that one thing 
And you've got that one thing 

[All] Oooooooh, Ooooooh (2x) 
[Harry] You've got that one thing 

[Liam] Get out, get out, get out of my head 
And fall into my arms instead 

[All] So get out, get out, get out of my head 
And fall into my arms instead 
I don't, I don't, don't know what it is 
But I need that one thing 
So get out get out get out of my mind ([Harry] Out of my mind) 
And come on come into my life 
I don't I don't don't know what it is 
But I need that one thing 
And you've got that one thing
                        
                    |
