                        You can dance every dance with the one
 Who gives you the eye, let him hold you tight
 You can smile every smile for the one
 That hold your hand in the pale moonlight Just don't forget who's takin' you home
 And in whose arms you're gonna be
 So darlin', save the last dance for me Oh, I know that the music's fine
 Like sparklin' wine, go and have your fun
 Dance and sing but while we're apart
 Don't give your heart to anyone Just don't forget who's takin' you home
 And in whose arms you're gonna be
 So darlin', save the last dance for me Baby, don't you know I love you so
 Can't you feel it when we touch
 I'll never never let you go
 I love you oh so much You can dance, go and carry on
 Till the night is gone, till it's time to go
 If she asks if you're all alone
 Can she take you home, you gotta tell her no And don't forget who's takin' you home
 And in whose arms you're gonna be
 So darlin', save the last dance for me Just don't forget who's takin' you home
 And in whose arms you're gonna be
 So darlin', save the last dance for me
 Darlin', save the last dance for me You can dance every dance with the one
 Who gives you the eye, let him hold you tight
 You can smile every smile for the one
 That holds your hand in the pale moonlight Just don't forget who's takin' you home
 And in whose arms you're gonna be
 So darlin', save the last dance for me
 Darlin', save the last dance for me
 Save the last dance for me
