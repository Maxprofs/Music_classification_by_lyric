Ah ah you're beautiful
Ah ah you're beautiful

Hop on,
The back of my bike
Let the good wind blow
Through your hair
With a a-like that,
And a smile so bright
Oh you're killing me
You know it aint fair

Ride on, through the middle of the night
Let the moonlight kiss your skin
When you dance like that,
Your jeans so tight
Oh you're killing me, baby do it again

You're beautiful,
And your mind is *** beautiful
And I can't pretend that
That doesn't mean a thing to me, to me, yeah

You're beautiful,
Good lord,
You're *** beautiful
And I can't pretend that
That doesn't mean a thing to me, to me, yeah

I like when you run red lights,
Don't stop till you thrill me,
Oh how you thrill me,
Always in control, how you do it I don't know but I don't care,
take me anywhere

Cause it's beautiful,
Ooh you make me feel undressable
And I can't pretend that
That doesn't mean nothing to me, to me, ohh yeah

You're beautiful,
And your mind is *** beautiful
And I can't pretend that
That doesn't mean a thing to me, to me, yeah

You're beautiful,
Good lord,
You're *** beautiful
And I can't pretend that
That doesn't mean a thing to me, to me, yeah

Ah ah you're beautiful
Ah ah you're beautiful

You don't know what you're doing darling hop on back my bike darling
Don't you worry darling
