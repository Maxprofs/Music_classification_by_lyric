                        The sun'll come out tomorrow
 Bet your bottom dollar
 That tomorrow there'll be sun Just thinkin' about, tomorrow
 Clears away the cobwebs and the sorrow
 Till' there's none When I'm stuck with a day
 That's gray and lonely
 I just stick out my chin and grin, and say Oh, the sun'll come out tomorrow
 So you gotta' hang on till' tomorrow
 Come what may Tomorrow, tomorrow
 I love you tomorrow
 You're only a day away The sun'll come out, tomorrow
 Bet your bottom dollar
 That tomorrow there'll be sun Just thinkin' about, tomorrow
 Clears away the cobwebs and the sorrow
 Till' there's none When I'm stuck with a day
 That's gray and lonely
 I just stick out my chin and grin, and say Oh, the sun'll come out tomorrow
 So you gotta' hang on till' tomorrow
 Come what may Tomorrow, tomorrow
 I love you tomorrow
 You're always a day away Tomorrow, tomorrow
 I love you tomorrow
 You're only a day away The sun'll come out, tomorrow
 Bet your bottom dollar
 That tomorrow there'll be sun Just thinkin' about, tomorrow
 Clears away the cobwebs and the sorrow
 Till' there's none When I'm stuck with a day
 That's gray and lonely
 I just stick out my chin and grin, and say Oh, the sun'll come out tomorrow
 So you gotta' hang on till' tomorrow
 Come what may Tomorrow, tomorrow
 I love you tomorrow
 You're always a day away Tomorrow, tomorrow
 I love you tomorrow
 You're only a day away
 You're only a day away You're only a day away
 You're only a day away
 You're only a day away
 You're only a day away You're only a day away
 You're only a day away
 You're only a day away
 You're only a day away
