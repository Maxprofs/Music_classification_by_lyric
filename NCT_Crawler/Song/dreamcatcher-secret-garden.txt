Dreamcatcher

Hear my silent prair,
heat my quiet call,
wonder darken loose sorround you.

Step into my sigh,
look inside the light,
you will know that I have found you.

Hear my silent prair,
heat my quiet call,
wonder darken loose sorround you.

Step into my sigh,
look inside the light,
you will know that I have found you.
