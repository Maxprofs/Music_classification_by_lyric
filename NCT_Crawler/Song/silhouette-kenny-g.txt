Beauty's Confusion - Silhouette


Covering
Cowering
In the corner
Of this room
Unnerved
Reserved
Deserving
This solitude
Wasting
Tasting
Rejection
Once again
Trying
To stop crying
I knew
It would end
I don't wanna try anymore
To be noticed
If it all ends the same way
Why even bother trying
You're the last one who will hurt me
I won't forget
I'll disappear into the background
I'll become a silhouette
Giving up and giving in
Is there any other way
Losing hope
Losing you
I'll lose it all someday
Someday, someday
Maybe this is not so bad
Being alone
Staring at the walls for hours
Disconnect the telephone
But you don't cross my mind at all
I'm alright
Inscribe these words into my head
Every night
What a lie
Giving up and giving in
Is there any other way
Losing hope, losing you
I'll lose it all someday

I can't explain it to you
My heart is open like a book
Why won't you take a look
I feel like a fool
A shadow in the midst
Which you won't even miss
I don't want to try anymore to be seen
I'm invisible anyway
I'm nobody's dream
You're the last one who will kiss me
I can't forget
I've disappeared into the distance
I've become a silhouette
I've disappeared
Into the distance
I've disappeared
Into the distance
I've disapp.
