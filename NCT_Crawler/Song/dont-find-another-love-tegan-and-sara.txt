                        Bài hát: Don't Find Another Love - Tegan And Sara

Won't you tell me what you want from me
Don't you know that I'd walk across the sea
Just to be with you
Just to see it through

You can find me on the edge tonight
You could talk me off the ledge tonight
If you wanted to
Don't you want me to

Please don't find another love
Please don't find another love
Please don't find another love when I'm away
Now our signal's breaking up
A satellite is not enough
Please don't find another love when I'm away

I could promise you're the only one
We could walk into the setting sun
If you wanted to
I'll follow you

Take a little and you turn away
Such a wicked little game to play
And I'm just a fool
How could you be so cruel

Please don't find another love
Please don't find another love
Please don't find another love when I'm away
Now our signal's breaking up
A satellite is not enough
Please don't find another love when I'm away

I'm losing my senses
I'm falling apart for us
Now I'm defenceless
I'm falling in endless love

So please don't find another love
Please don't find another love
Please don't find another love when I'm away
Now our signal's breaking up
A satellite is not enough
Please don't find another love when I'm away
