                        Bài hát: Hysteria - Steve Aoki, Matthew Koma

Tighten your harness to the storm
Channel your waves to chase me once more
Carry on, carry on, carry on

Your honor is sleeping with the saints
We are alive and loving the stakes
Carry on, carry on, carry on

[Chorus x2:]
Open your mind to the light of hysteria
Chasing the high, never find your hysteria
Open your eyes in the light of hysteria
I know you feel it

I am the risk you need to take
The guilt on your conscience and your jailbait
Carry on, carry on, carry on

So I'll be the taxi you can hail
The head on a coin you toss to make bail
Carry on, carry on, carry on

[Chorus x2:]
Open your mind to the light of hysteria
Chasing the high, never find your hysteria
Open your eyes in the light of hysteria
I know you feel it
                        
                    |
