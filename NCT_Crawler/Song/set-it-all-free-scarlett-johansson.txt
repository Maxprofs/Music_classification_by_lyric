                        Bài hát: Set It All Free - Scarlett Johansson

I followed my heart into the fire
Got burned, got broken down by desire
I tried, I tried but the smoke in my eyes
Left me blurry, blurry and blind
I picked all the pieces up off the ground
I've burned all my fingers but that's gone now
Got the glue in my hands and stick into the plan
Stick into the plan that says "I can"

Do anything at all
I can do anything at all

This is my kiss goodbye
You can stand alone and watch me fly
Cause nothing's keeping me down
Gonna let it all up
Come on and say right now, right now, right now
This is my big hello
Cause I'm giving, never letting go
I can find a little [?], it's not just a dream
Gonna set it all free, all free, all free

Just set it all free

I was a girl caught under your thumb
But my scars gonna shine brighter than your sun
And I will break your heart, shoot so far
Gonna hit, gonna hit, hit every target

It counts this time
I will make it count this time

This is my kiss goodbye
You can stand alone and watch me fly
Cause nothing's keeping me down
I'm gonna let it all up
Come on and say right now, right now, right now
This is my big hello
Cause I'm giving, never letting go
I can find a little [?], it's not just a dream
Gonna set it all free, all free, all free

Just set it all free
Just set it all free
Just set it all free

This is my kiss goodbye
You can stand alone and watch me fly
Cause nothing's keeping me down
I'm gonna let it all up
Come on and say right now, right now, right now
This is my big hello
Cause I'm giving, never letting go
I can find a little [?], it's not just a dream
Gonna set it all free, all free, all free

Just set it all free
Just set it all free
Just set it all free
