[00:-7.52]Eminem Ft. Drake, Kanye West & Lil Wayne - Forever

(Chorus)
It may not mean nothing to y'all,
Understand nothing was done for me,
So i don't plan on stopping at all,
I want this sh-t forever man, ever man, ever man,
I'm shutting sh-t down at the mall,
And telling every girl she the one for me,
And i aint even planning to call,
I want this sh-t forever man, ever man, ever man,

(Drake)
Last name ever,
First name greatest,
Like a sprained ankle boy ain't nothing to play with,
It started off local but thanks to all the haters,
I know G4 pilots on a first name basis,
And your city faded off to brown, Nino,
She insists she got more class, we know!
Swimming in the money come and find me, nemo,
If i was at the club you know I ball, Kimo,
Drop the mixtape that sh-t sounded like an album
Who'd have thought a country wide tour would be the outcome
Labels want my name but sign the x like Malcom
Everybody got a deal, I did it without one,
Yeah n-gga i'm about my business,
Killing all these rappers you would swear I had a hit list,
Everybody who guided me is asking for forgiveness,
If you aint been a part of it at least you got to witness,
B-tches,

(Chorus)
It may not mean nothing to y'all,
Understand nothing was done for me,
So i don't plan on stopping at all,
I want this sh-t forever man, ever man, ever man,
I'm shutting sh-t down at the mall,
And telling every girl she the one for me,
And i aint even planning to call,
I want this sh-t forever man, ever man, ever man,

(Kanye West)
I used to have hood dreams,
Big fame, big chains,
I stuck my d-ck inside this life until that b-tch came,
I went hard all fall like the ? teams,
Just so I can make it rain all spring,
Y'all seen my story my glory,
I had raped the game young,
You can call it statutory,
When a n-gga blow up they can build statures of me
Old money Benjamin Button, whaat, nuttin,
Now superbad chicks giving me macLovin,
You would think I ran the world like Michelle's husband,
You would think these n-ggas would know me when they really doesn't
Like they was down with the old me no you f-cking wasn’t,
Your'e such a f-cking loser,
He didn't even go to class mueller,
Trade the Grammy plaques just to have my granny back,
Remember she had that bad hip like a fanny pack,
Chasing that stardom would turn you into a maniac,
All the way in Hollywood and I can't even act,
They pull their cameras out and God damn they snap,
I used to want this thing forever you can have it back,

(Chorus)
It may not mean nothing to y'all,
Understand nothing was done for me,
So i don't plan on stopping at all,
I want this sh-t forever man, ever man, ever man,
I'm shutting sh-t down at the mall,
And telling every girl she the one for me,
And i aint even planning to call,
I want this sh-t forever man, ever man, ever man,

(Lil Wayne)
Ok, hello its da martian,
Space jam Jordan's,
I want this sh-t forever wake and smell the Garden,
F-cker then the hardest
Step up to the target,
If i had one guess than I guess im just New Orleans,
And I will never stop like i'm running from the cops,
Hop up in my car and told my chauffeur to the top,
Life is like a f-cking roller coaster then it drops,
But what should I scream for this is my theme park,
My minds shine even when my thoughts seem dark,
Pistol on my side you don't wanna hear that thing talk,
Let the king talk check the price and pay attention,
Lil Wayne thats what they got to say or mention,
Im like Nirvada in the middle of the summer,
I'm resting in the lead I need a pillow and a cover,
Shhh, my foots sleeping on the gas,
No brake pads no such thing as last,

(Chorus)
It may not mean nothing to y'all,
Understand nothing was done for me,
So i don't plan on stopping at all,
I want this sh-t forever man, ever man, ever man,
I'm shutting sh-t down at the mall,
And telling every girl she the one for me,
And i aint even planning to call,
I want this sh-t forever man, ever man, ever man,

(Eminem)
There they go, back in stadiums,
It's shady's b-tches flow,
Nuts they go, macadamia they go sablistic yo,
We can make them look like boso’s,
He's wondering if he should spit this slow,
F-ck no go for broke,
His cup just wanna throw over, oh no,
He aint had a buzz like this since the last time he overdosed,
They've been waiting patiently for Pinnochio to poke his nose,
Back into the game and they know,
Rap will never be the same as before,
Bashing in the brains of these hoes,
And establishing a name as he goes,
The passion of the flame is ignited,
You can't put it out once we light it,
This is sh-t exactly what the f-ck i'm talking about when we write it,
You dealing with a mutual villain,
So stay inside of the boots you spillin
So spit true feelings, til true feelings come flying up out of our mouths
Never mind it,
Payback muthaf-cker for the way you how's it taste,
When I slap the taste out your mouth with the bass so loud that it shakes the place,
I'm hannibal lecters son just in case your thinking of saving face,
You aint gonna have no face to save by the time Im through with this place,
So Drake

(Chorus)
It may not mean nothing to y'all,
Understand nothing was done for me,
So i don't plan on stopping at all,
I want this sh-t forever man, ever man, ever man,
I'm shutting sh-t down at the mall,
And telling every girl she the one for me,
And i aint even planning to call,
I want this sh-t forever man, ever man, ever man,
