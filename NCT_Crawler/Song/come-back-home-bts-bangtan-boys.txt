CUZ I'M COMIN BACK HOME
What am I trying so hard to find right now?
Where am I endlessly flowing to right now?
I have seen the end of my life
My heart feels stifling deep inside
The thing that's blocking my life is-
My fear about my tomorrow
Angry Hungry Yes I'm hangry
Every day is a repetition, future is bullshit
I wasn't present
And there's no tomorrow either
Because we're still young
Because we have a better future
Now, wipe that cold tears away and
COME BACK HOME
Why do you waste time?
My bloody sweats are honest
Now, I engrave my name on that trophy and
COME BACK HOME

YOU MUST COME BACK HOME
Warmer than the heart that has departed
YOU MUST COME BACK HOME
In the rough life
YOU MUST COME BACK HOME
Warmer than the heart that has departed
YOU MUST COME BACK HOME
I will complete myself
COME BACK TO MY HOME
COME BACK HOME
COME BACK TO MY HOME
COME BACK HOME
In this rough life
COME BACK TO MY HOME
COME BACK HOME
COME BACK TO MY HOME
COME BACK HOME
I will complete myself

An honor to my family, to my mother
and for my family to be wealthy and safe
I continue to work hard, work hard, work hard
Friends, don't you worry
Our future is bright
STARTED FROM THE BOTTOM
AND WE STILL GOING UP
I want more things
Because we're still young
Because we have a better future
Now, wipe that cold tears away and
COME BACK HOME
Why do you waste time?
My bloody sweats are honest
Now, I engrave my name on that trophy and
COME BACK HOME

YOU MUST COME BACK HOME
Warmer than the heart that has departed
YOU MUST COME BACK HOME
In the rough life
YOU MUST COME BACK HOME
Warmer than the heart that has departed
YOU MUST COME BACK HOME
I will complete myself
OH YOU MUST COME BACK
YOU MUST COME BACK
YOU MUST COME BACK HOME
Come back home
OH YOU MUST COME BACK
YOU MUST COME BACK
YOU MUST COME BACK HOME
Come back home
CUZ I'M COMIN BACK HOME
YOU MUST COME BACK HOME
Warmer than the heart that has departed
YOU MUST COME BACK HOME
Warmer than the heart that has departed
In the rough life
YOU MUST COME BACK HOME
Warmer than the heart that has departed
YOU MUST COME BACK HOME
I will complete myself
COME BACK TO MY HOME
COME BACK HOME
COME BACK TO MY HOME
COME BACK HOME
In the rough life
COME BACK TO MY HOME
COME BACK HOME
COME BACK TO MY HOME
COME BACK HOME
I will complete myself
