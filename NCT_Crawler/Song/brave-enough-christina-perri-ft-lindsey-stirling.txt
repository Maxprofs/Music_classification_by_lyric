                        Bài hát: Brave Enough - Christina Perri, Lindsey Stirling

[Verse 1]
There's something too sure to say
I was too afraid
It was just hard to let you know
Now it's all too late

[Pre-Chorus]
What we had was beautiful
I didn't want to wreck it all
Every day I think about the truth
[Chorus]
I wish I was
I wish I was
Brave enough to love you
Brave enough to love you

I wish I was
I wish I was
Brave enough to love you
Brave enough, brave enough
Brave enough to love you

[Verse 2]
Stripped away the walls I built
But no one ever has
The hardest part is never known
If we were meant to last

[Pre-Chorus]
What we had was beautiful
I didn't want to wreck it all
Every day I think about the truth

[Chorus]
I wish I was
I wish I was

Brave enough to love you
Brave enough to love you

I wish I was
I wish I was
Brave enough to love you
Brave enough, brave enough
Brave enough to love you

[Outro]
Brave enough to love you
Brave enough to love you
I wish I was
I wish I was
Brave enough to love you
Brave enough, brave enough
Brave enough to love you
                        
                    |
