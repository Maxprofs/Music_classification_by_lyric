                        Bài hát: Ugly (English Version) - V.A

I put a big smile on, but I don’t like how I look
I’m not pretty, I’m not beautiful
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
I sing a song but no one listens to me
I’m not pretty, I’m not beautiful
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Why am I this unattractive?
How can I smile beautifully like you?
I get mad again, why am I never perfect?
I complain again looking at my ugly-self through the broken mirror
Don’t look at me, I don’t like this feeling
I want to hide somewhere, I want to get out
This world is full of lies

I think I’m ugly and nobody wants to love me
Just like her, I wanna be pretty
I wanna be pretty
Don’t lie to my face tellin’ me I’m pretty
I think I’m ugly and nobody wants to love me
Just like her I wanna be pretty
I wanna be pretty
Don’t lie to my face cause I know I’m ugly

Don’t tell me that easily that you understand how I feel
I might resent you with my ugly and crooked heart
Don’t talk to me, I can’t get along with you
Your cold fakeness behind your arrogant eyes suffocate me
Don’t come near me, I hate your attention
I wanna leave for somewhere and shout
This world is full of lies

I think I’m ugly and nobody wants to love me
Just like her, I wanna be pretty
I wanna be pretty
Don’t lie to my face tellin’ me I’m pretty
I think I’m ugly and nobody wants to love me
Just like her I wanna be pretty
I wanna be pretty
Don’t lie to my face cause I know I’m ugly

All alone, I’m all alone, I’m all alone
There’s not warmth, no one is next to me
All alone, I’m all alone
All alone, I’m all alone
i’m always all alone
There’s no warmth, there’s no one to give me a hug

I think I’m ugly and nobody wants to love me
Just like her, I wanna be pretty
I wanna be pretty
Don’t lie to my face tellin’ me I’m pretty
I think I’m ugly and nobody wants to love me
Just like her I wanna be pretty
I wanna be pretty
Don’t lie to my face cause I know I’m ugly
