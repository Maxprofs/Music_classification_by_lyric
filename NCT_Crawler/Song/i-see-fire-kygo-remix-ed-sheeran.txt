                        Bài hát: I See Fire (Kygo Remix) - Ed Sheeran

If this is to end in fire
Then we shall burn together
Watch the flames climb higher into the night
Calling out father, oh, stand by and we will
Watch the flames burn on and on
The mountainside

And if we should die tonight
Then we should all die together
Raise a glass of wine for the last time
Calling out father, oh
Prepare as we will
Watch the flames burn on and on
The mountainside

Desolation comes upon the sky

Now I see fire
Inside the mountains
I see fire
Burning the trees
And I see fire
Hollowing souls
And I see fire
Burning the breeze
And I hope that you remember me

Oh, should my people fall then
Surely I'll do the same
Confined in mountain halls
We got too close to the flame
Calling out father, oh
Hold fast and we will
Watch the flames burn on and on
The mountainside

Desolation comes upon the sky

Now I see fire
Inside the mountains
I see fire
Burning the trees
And I see fire
Hollowing souls
And I see fire
Burning the breeze
And I hope that you remember me

Now I see fire
Inside the mountains
I see fire
Burning the trees
And I see fire
Hollowing souls
And I see fire
Burning the breeze
And I hope that you remember me
                        
                    |
