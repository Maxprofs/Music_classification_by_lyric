Âu Mỹ khác|

                        Ooh-ooh
La-Da-Da Da-Da

I never knew I lost ya till I found ya
And I never guessed how close you were to me
And now I wanna throw my arms around ya
Tell a thousand tales that will astound ya
Everything about you tells me this was meant to be
Don't you see

I'm on your side
Let's take this ride
And together we're facing the world
Doing things nobody's done before
And the great divide
Doesn't seem so wide anymore

Naaaa

I can't recall what life was like without ya
Now it feels as though we've never been apart
Tell me every tiny thing about ya
Anything you say I'll never doubt you


We're meant to be together
I can feel it in my heart
Its just the start

I'm on your side
Let's take this ride
And together we're facing the world
Doing things nobody's done before
And the great divide
Doesn't seem so wide...

And if you'll be there beside me when I falter
Then whatever comes I know we'll take it all in stride
I'm on your side

The great divide
It doesn't seem so wide

I'm on your side
Let's take this ride
And together we're facing the world
Doing things nobody's done before
And the great divide
Doesn't seem so wide anymore...
