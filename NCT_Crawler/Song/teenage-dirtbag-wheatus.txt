                        Bài hát: Teenage Dirtbag - Wheatus

Her name is Noel
 I had a dream about her
 She rings my bell
 I got gym class in half an hour
 Oh how she rocks
 In keds and tube socks
 But she doesn't know who I am
 And she doesn't give a damn about me 'Cause I'm just a teenage dirtbag baby
 Yeah I'm just a teenage dirtbag baby
 Listen to Iron Maiden maybe with me Her boyfriend's a dick
 He brings a gun to school
 And he'd simply kick
 My ass if he knew the truth
 He lives on my block
 And he drives an Iroc
 But he doesn't know who I am
 And he doesn't give a damn about me 'Cause I'm just a teenage dirtbag baby
 Yeah I'm just a teenage dirtbag baby
 Listen to Iron Maiden maybe with me Oh yeah dirtbag
 She doesn't know what she's missing
 Oh yeah
 Dirtbag
 She doesn't know what she's missing Man I feel like mold
 It's prom night and I am lonely
 Low and behold
 She's walking over to me
 This must be fake
 My lips start to shake
 How does she know who I am
 And why does she give a damn about me I've got two tickets to Iron Maiden baby
 Come with me Friday, don't say maybe
 I'm just a teenage dirtbag baby
 Like you
 Oooh Oh yeah dirtbag
 She doesn't know what she's missing
 Oh yeah dirtbag
 She doesn't know what she's missing
