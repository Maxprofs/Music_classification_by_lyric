                        "It's not really poetry but it's pretty", he said
 As he raises his voice, she lowers her head
 "It makes my heart heavy, you're lonely, I think
 Oh, Rose, you're sad, I suppose" But look in her bed and she's bound to be sleeping
 She's lying there dead but she's breathing Furious Rose, with your opiate eyes
 Your languorous hum, that tone of surprise
 I've heard energy in adversity, your smile, the soul of witchery
 You're not running away, you're not running, are you? Lyrically longing, she's tearing the words from the page
 She's fearfully seething
 "Bring me your blessings, a prayer, or a new pen
 You don't know what I need" You look in my bed and I'm bound to be sleeping
 I'm lying there dead but I'm breathing And I'm barely balancing as it is
 And I don't want to drown in my dreams
 Bring me wild plums, wild plums and agrimonia
 I bet you don't even know what that means Furious Rose, with your opiate eyes
 Your languorous hum, that tone of surprise
 I've heard energy in adversity, your smile, the soul of witchery
 You're not running away, you're not running You're not running away, you're not running
 You're not running away, you're not running, are you? Gingerly peering, over his shoulder
 Removed herself from the room
 She's terribly freezing, she always knows
 When to go
