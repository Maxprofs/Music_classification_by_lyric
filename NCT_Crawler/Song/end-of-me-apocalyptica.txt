Âu Mỹ khác|

                        Rosaries
Left under the mattress
All those memories
Who could bear the witness ?
As you slip into oblivion
Use it like a weapon
And I'm left to bleed
Waiting for the moment
When you've had your fun
A loaded gun

Take away your broken misery
I can't always erase your memory
This love this love
Is gonna be the end of me
Everything I gave is wasted
I'm the one whose suffocated
This love this love
Is gonna be the end of me

Can't resist
Poisoning the message
Just a narcissist
Trapped inside the wreckage
And the sympathy I had is gone
Deadened by the ceremony
Drama queen
Stand behind your rampart
As your kingdom falls
All because

Take away your broken misery
I can't always erase your memory
This love this love
IS gonna be the end of me
Everything I gave is wasted
I'm the one whose suffocated
This love this love
Is gonna be the end of me

Your rescue, my undo
I'm not the one to save you
I'm empty, completely
I'm drowning in your shadow

Take away your broken misery
I can't always erase your memory
This love this love
Is gonna be the end of me
Everything I gave is wasted
I'm the one whose suffocated
This love this love
Is gonna be the end of me

I can't change away your ghost
Inside it only grows
Nothing left but misery
This will be the end of me

All the * that you created
All the scars you celebrated
Couldn't take away your pain
Couldn't resurrect your name

This love will be the end of me
This love will be the end
                        
                    |
