                        Bài hát: Buy you a drank - T-Pain, Young Joc

Snap ya fingers do the step
You can do it all by yourself

Baby girl
What's your name
Let me talk to you
Let me buy you a drink
I'm t-pain, you know me
Konvict music
Have every boy like ohh wee
I know the club close at 3
What's the chance a you rollin with me
Back to the crib
Show you how I live
Lets get drunk forget what we did

[Chorus:]
Imma buy you a drank
Theen imma take you home with me
I got money in the bank
Shawty whachu think bout that
Find me in the grey cadillac
We in the bed like
Ooh ooh ohh, ooh ooh
We in the bed like
Ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh

Talk to me, I talk back
Lets talk money, I top that
Crunk juice bottle
Oakly shades
Shawty got class
Oh behave
Lets get gone
Walk it out (walk it out)
Just like that
That's what I'm talkin bout
We gone have fun
You gone see
On that patron
You should get like me

[Chorus:]
Imma buy you a drank
Theen imma take you home with me
I got money in the bank
Shawty whachu think bout that
Find me in the grey cadillac
We in the bed like
Ooh ooh ohh, ooh ooh
We in the bed like
Ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh

Wont you meet me at the bar
Respect big pimpin
Tell me how you feel
Mama tell me what you sippin
A certified dime piece
Deserve louy 1-3
150 a shot
3 for you and 3 for me
I'm checkin yo body language
I love the conversation
And when you lick your lips
I get a tinglin sensation
Now were both bout tipsy
You say you in the mood
All I need is bout a hour
Better yet maybe two
Let me take you where I live
Ferrari switch gears
When I whisper in ya ear
Ya legs hit the chandilleer
Passion fruit and sex
All in the atmosphere
Imma let t-pain sing it
So he can make it clear

[Chorus:]
Imma buy you a drank
Theen imma take you home with me
I got money in the bank
Shawty whachu think bout that
Find me in the grey cadillac
We in the bed like
Ooh ooh ohh, ooh ooh
We in the bed like
Ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh

Lets get gone
Walk it out
(Now walk it out bang yo body
Aaaahhhh snap)
Now rock rock rock rock
You can do it all by yoself
[X2]

[Chorus:]
Imma buy you a drank
Theen imma take you home with me
I got money in the bank
Shawty whachu think bout that
Find me in the grey cadillac
We in the bed like
Ooh ooh ohh, ooh ohh
We in the bed like
Ooh ooh ooh, ooh ooh
                        
                    |
