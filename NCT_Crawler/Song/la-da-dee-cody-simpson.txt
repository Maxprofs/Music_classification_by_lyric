                        Bài hát: La Da Dee - Cody Simpson

[Verse 1] 
Theres no way to say this songs about someone else 
Every time you're not in my arms 
I start to lose myself 
Someone please pass me my shade 
Don't let them see me down 
You have taken over my days 
So tonight i'm going out 

[Pre Chorus] 
Yeah im feeling like 
There is no better place than right by your side. 
I had a little taste 
And im always for the party anywhere 
Cause all the girls are looking fine 
But your the only one on my mind 

[Chorus] 
La da dee 
La la da doo 
La la da me 
La la da you 
La da dee 
La la da doo 
Theres only me 
Theres only you 
La da dee 
La la da doo 
La la da me 
La la da you 
La da dee 
La la da doo 
When you're gone 
Ill think of you 

[Verse 2] 
All these places packed with people 
But your face is all i see 
And the musics way to loud 
But your voice wont let me be. 
So many pretty girls around 
They're just dressing to impress 
but the thought of you alone 
Has got me smiling 
I dont know what to say next 

[Pre Chorus] 
Yeah im feeling like 
there is no better place than 
right by your side 
I had a little taste 
Now im always for the party anywhere 
Cause all the girls are looking fine 
but your the only one on my mind 

[Chorus] x2 
La da dee 
La la da doo 
La la da me 
La la da you 
La da dee 
La la da doo 
Theres only me 
Theres only you 
La da dee 
La la da doo 
La la da me 
La la da you 
La da dee 
La la da doo 
When you are gone 
Ill think of you 

[Bridge] 
Ill pretend the night is so beautiful 
Take a photo with the bros 
La da dee 
La da da doo 
They won't see through my disguise 
Right here behind my eyes 
Replaying in my mind 
La dee da 
YEAH 

[Pre Chorus 
Im feeling like 
there is no better place than 
right by your side 
I had a little taste 
Now im always for the party anywhere 
Cause all the girls are looking fine 
but your the only one on my mind 

[Chorus] x2 
La da dee 
La la da doo 
La la da me 
La la da you 
La da dee 
La la da doo 
Theres only me 
Theres only you 
La da dee 
La la da doo 
La la da me 
La la da you 
La da dee 
La la da doo 
When you are gone 
Ill think of you
                        
                    |
