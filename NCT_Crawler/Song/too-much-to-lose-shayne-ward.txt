                        Bài hát: Too Much To Lose - Shayne Ward

There from the start
You gave to me all i need
What a fool i’ve been
But i found it hard
To give to you all of me
Don’t end it, please

If only i’d seen
You were right there for me
You were my drive and my fight
The push in the right direction
You were perfection

Now that i need you
You gotta stay
Now that i love you
You can’t walk away
Never a heart could be so true
I didn’t find you ‘til
There was too much to lose

Baby, if i
Had the chance to make you believe
My, my energy

Oh, why couldn’t i see
What was in front of me
You were my drive and my fight
The push in the right direction
You were perfection

Now that i need you
You gotta stay
Now that i love you
You can’t walk away
All of my hope would disappear
I would be lost without you here
Now that i want you back in my life
I promise you it’s all worth the fight
Never a heart could be so true
I didn’t find you ‘til
There was too much to lose

Hush baby, listen
Listen to me
I need to tell you
What you mean to me
You’re my everything
Just give me a chance to prove

Now, now that i need you
You gotta stay
Now that i love you
You can’t walk away
All of my hope would disappear
I would be lost, so lost 
Now that i want you back in my life
I promise you it’s all worth the fight
Never a heart could be so true
I didn’t find you ‘til
There was too much to lose

Never a heart could be so true
Now that i’ve found you, girl
We’ve got too much to lose
                        
                    |
