                        Bài hát: I Just Had Sex - The Lonely Island

[Lonely Island] 
Sometimes 
Something beautiful happens 
in this world 

[Akon] 
Oh 
Akon 
And Lonely Island 

[Lonely Island] 
You don't know how to express yourself so 
You just gotta sing 

[Akon] 
I just had sex 
And it felt so good (felt so good) 
A woman let me put my penis inside her (her) 
I just had sex (Hey!) 
And I'll never go back (never go back) 
To the not-having-sex 
Ways of the past 

[Andy Samberg] 

Have you ever had sex? 
I have, it felt great 
It felt so good when I did it with my penis 

A girl let me do it 
It literally just happened 
Having sex could make a nice man out' the meanest 

[Jorma] 

You'll never guess where I just came from 
I had sex 
If I had to describe the feeling it was the best 

When I had the sex 
'Meant my penis felt great 
And I called my parents right after I was done 

[Andy Samberg] 

Oh hey, didn't see you there 
Guess what I just did 
Had sex, undressed, saw her boobies and the rest 

[Jorma] 

Well sure 
Nice of her to let you do that thing 

[Andy Samberg] 

Nice of any girl ever 

[Jorma] 

Now sing 

[Akon] 
I just had sex 
And it felt so good (felt so good) 
A woman let me put my penis inside her (her) 
I Wanna tell the world 

[Andy Samberg] 

To be honest 
I'm surprised she even wanted me to do it 

[Jorma] 

Doesn't really make sense 

[Andy Samberg] 

But man, screw it 

[Jorma] 

I ain't one to argue with a good thing 

[Andy Samberg] 

She could be my wife 

[Jorma] 

That good? 

[Andy Samberg] 

The best 30 seconds of my life 

[Jorma] 

I'm so humbled by a girls ability to let me do her 

[Andy Samberg] 

Cuz honestly I'd have sex with a pile of manure 
With that in mind the soft, nice-smellin' girl's better 

[Jorma] 

She let me wear my chain and my turtle neck sweater 

[Akon] 

So this one's dedicated to them girls 
That let us flop around on top of them 
If you're near or far, whether short or tall 
We wanna thank you all for lettin' us *** you 

[Jorma] 

She kept looking at her watch 

[Akon] 

Doesn't matter, I had sex 

[Andy Samberg] 

But I cried the whole time 

[Akon] 

Doesn't matter, I had sex 

[Jorma] 

I think she might have been a racist 

[Akon] 

Doesn't matter, I had sex 

[Andy Samberg] 

She put a bag on my head 

[Akon] 

Still counts 
I just had sex 
And my dreams came true (dreams came true) 
So if you had sex in the last 30 minutes then you're qualified to sing with me 
I just had sex (everybody sing!) 
And it felt so good (we all had sex!) 
A woman let me put my penis inside her (I wanna tell the whole world!)
I just had sex (I just had sex!) 
And I'll never go back (no, no, no!) 
To the not-having-sex 
Ways of the past
                        
                    |
