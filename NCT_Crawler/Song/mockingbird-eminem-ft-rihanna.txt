[Intro]
Yeah,
I know sometimes,
things may not,
always makes sense to you right now.
But hey,what'd daddy always tell you?
Straighten up little soldier.
Stiffen up that upper lip.
What you crying about?
You got me.

[Verse 1]
Halie I know you miss your mom,
And I know you miss your dad,
When I'm gone, but I'm tryin to give you the life that I never had
I can see your sad,
Even when you smile, even when you laugh ,
I can see it in your eyes, deep inside you wanna cry,
Cause you're scared, I ain't there?
Daddy's with you in your prayers
No more cyrin', wipe them tears
Daddy's here, no more nightmares
We gon' pull together through it, we gon' do it
Laney uncles crazy ain't he?
Yeah, but he loves you girl and you better know it
We're all we got in this world
When it spins when it swirls
When it whirls when it twirls
Two little beautiful girls
Lookin puzzled in a daze, I know it's confusin' you
Daddy's always on the move, mama's always on the news
I try to keep you sheltered from it, but somehow it seems,
The harder that I try to do that the more it back fires on me
All the things growin' up, as daddy that he had to see
Daddy don't want you to see, but you see just as much as he did
We did not plan it to be this way, your mother and me
But things have got so bad between us
I don't see us ever bein' together ever again
Like we used to be when we was teenagers
But then of course everything always happens for a reason
I guess it was never meant to be
But its just somethin' we have no control over,
And that's what destiny is
Well no more worries rest your head and go to sleep
Maybe one day we'll wake up, and this will all just be a dream

[Chorus]
Now hush little baby,
Don't you cry, everything's gonna be alright
Stiffen that upper lip up little lady,
I told ya, Daddy's here to hold ya, through the night
I know mommy's not here right now and we don't know why
We feel how we feel inside
It may seem a little crazy, pretty baby
But I promise mamas gon' be alright
                        
                    |
