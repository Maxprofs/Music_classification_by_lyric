Jody Watley - Will You Still Love Me Tomorrow
( Edited By YoYo )
( Dedicated this LRC to の1937 )

Tonight you're mine completely
You give your love so sweetly
Tonight the light of love is in your eyes
But will you love me tomorrow

Is this a lasting treasure
Or just a moment's pleasure
Can I believe the magic in your eyes
Will you still love me tomorrow

Tonight with words unspoken
You say that I'm the only one
But will the spell be broken
When the night meets the morning sun
And I'd like to know if your love
Is love I can be sure of
So tell me now and I won't ask again
Will you still love me tomorrow
Tomorrow
Tomorrow
Will you still love me
Will you still love me
Tomorrow
