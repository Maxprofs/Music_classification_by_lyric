                        They're more than just words
 They're colors to paint my feelings for you
 And I know how that there's no way to show you
 Just how much I care And I feel it, oh, so deep within me
 And I know that there's so much left to share
 All the times you're away, feels just like eternity
 As the moments that we had, had to end The strokes of the brush
 Brings me closer to your touch
 Through the hues well find a way to follow
 I know we will And the colors are so vibrant like the sun on the ocean
 And the hues they will change from day to day
 But I know that, that the picture of love would last forever
 On this Canvas of our lives that we create
 (And our love will last forever) And I know that always, I saw to try to display
 Just how precious that you are to the world
 Cause I know with just a touch, you can show me, oh, so much
 That there's more to this life than what we see The strokes of the brush
 Brings me closer to your touch
 Through the hues well find a way to follow
 I know we will And the colors are so vibrant like the sun on the ocean
 And the hues they will change from day to day
 But I know that, that the picture of love would last forever
 On this Canvas of our lives that we create
 (And our love will last forever) Colors may fade
 Turning vibrant to gray
 But one things unchanged
 The picture is still the same And through the days and nights the vision lives on forever
 And through a masterpiece of love me made together
 We've given all we can, I know the world will understand
 The picture is of you and me And the colors are so vibrant like the sun on the ocean
 And the hues they will change from day to day
 But I know that, that the picture of love would last forever
 On this Canvas of our lives that we create
 (And our love will last forever)
