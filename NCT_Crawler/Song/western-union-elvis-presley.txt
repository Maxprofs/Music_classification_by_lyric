 (Clickety clack)
 Oh, Western Union
 (Clickety clack) I had a fight with my baby
 Ooh, how sorry I am
 She won't talk to me, no how
 I'm gonna send a telegram Western Union, oh, yeah
 (Western Union, clickety clack)
 ([Incomprehensible])
 Send my lovin' baby back to me She won't open my letters
 She won't answer the phone
 When I'm ringin' her doorbell
 She says there ain't nobody home Oh, Western Union, oh, yeah
 (Western Union, clickety clack)
 ([Incomprehensible])
 Send my lovin' baby back to me Oh, Western Union, oh, yeah
 (Western Union, clickety clack)
 ([Incomprehensible])
 Send my lovin' baby back to me 'I love you' is my message
 Just three words and no more
 She won't let you deliver
 Slip it underneath her door Western Union, oh, yeah
 (Western Union, clickety clack)
 ([Incomprehensible])
 Send my lovin' baby back to me Oh, western Union, oh, yeah
 (Western Union, clickety clack)
 ([Incomprehensible])
 Ooh, send my lovin' baby back to me
