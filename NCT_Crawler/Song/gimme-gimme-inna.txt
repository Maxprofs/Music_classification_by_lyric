                        Bài hát: Gimme Gimme - INNA

I pulled up to a palace in old town
20 minutes from Bali, oh yeah
Got a feeling that it's about to go down
Party people wanna party so I say

Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme that love
Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme that love
I'mma love you, love you, love you long time
So give me, give me the way that I like it

Everybody all stay when the night ends
We can do it all again when the sun's up
You know I really wanna be that one you wind in
You know you really wanna give me your love

Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme that love
Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme that love
I'mma love you, love you, love you long time
So give me, give me the way that I like it
