                        Bài hát: We Are The World (Demo) - Michael Jackson

There is a time when we should heed a certain cause
'Cause the world, it seems is riding it's line
'Cause there's a chance for taking
In needing our own lives
It seems we need nothing at all

I used to feel, I should give away my heart
And it shows that we are needing in there
Then I read the headlines
And it said they're dying there
And it showed that we was heeding a stand

We are the world, we are the children
We are the one to make a brighter day
So let's start giving
There's a chance we're taking
We're taking our whole lives
It's true, we'll make a brighter day
Just you and me

Give them your heart
And you will see that someone cares
'Cause you know that they can't feed them all
Then I read the paper
And it said that children die
And it shows that soon can we work hard

We are the world, we are the children
We are the one to make a brighter day
So let's start giving
But there's a chance we're taking
We're taking our whole lives
It's true, we'll make a brighter day
Just you and me

Now there's a time when we must love at all
And it seems that life, it don't make love at all
But everyday and I love you more and more
It's she and I, didn't do it better

We are the world
(The world)
We are the children
(Are the children)
We are the ones to make a brighter day
So let's starting giving
(Let's start giving)

There's a chance we're taking
We're taking our whole lives
It's true, we'll make a brighter day
Just you and me

We are the world
(Are the world)
We are the children
(Are the children)
We are the one to make a brighter day
So let's start giving
(So let's start giving)

There's a chance we're taking
(Taking)
We're taking our whole lives
It's, true we'll make a brighter day
Just you and me

We are the world
(Sha la)
We are the children
(Sha lingay)
We are the one to make a brighter day
(Sha la)
So let's start giving
('Cause that's what we're being)

There's a chance we're taking
We're taking our whole lives
It's true, we'll make a brighter day
Just you and me

We are the world
(Sha la)
We are the children
(Sha lingay)
We are the one to make a brighter day
(Sha la)
So let's start giving
('Cause that's what we're being)

There's a chance we're taking
We're taking our whole lives
It's true, we'll make a brighter day
Just you and me

We are the world
(Sha la)
We are the children
(Sha lingay)
We are the one to make a brighter day
(Sha la)
So let's start giving

We're taking our whole lives
It's true, we'll make a brighter day
Just you and me
