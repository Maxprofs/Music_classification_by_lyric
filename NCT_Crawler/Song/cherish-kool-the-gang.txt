                        Let's take a walk together
near the ocean shore

hand in hand
you and I.
Let's cherish ev'ry moment
we have been given

for time is passing by.

I often pray before I lay
down by your side;
If you receive your calling before I awake

Could I make it through the night?

Cherish the love we have
we should cherish the life we live

Cherish the love
cherish the life
cherish the love.
Cherish the love we have
for as long as we both
shall live

Cherish the love
cherish the life
cherish the love.

The world is always changing
nothing stays the same

But love was stand the test of time.
The next life that we live
in remains to be seen

Will you be by my side?
I offen pray before I lay down
by your side . . .

Cherish the love we have

we should cherish the life
we live - baby yeah -
Cherish the love
cherish the life - oh yeah -
cherish the love.
Cherish the love we have -
while we're together -
For as long as we both shall
live - will you love me -
Cherish the love

cherish the love.

Cherish the love
cherish the life.
Cherish the love we have
we should cherish the life we live

Cherish the love
cherish the life

Cherish the love we have -
ev'ry night when I think
about you -
For as long as we both shall live -
I pray that my dream will come true
Cherish the love

Cherish the love we have -
