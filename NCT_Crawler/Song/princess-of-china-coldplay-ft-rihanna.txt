                        Once upon a time somebody ran
Somebody ran away saying as fast as I can
I got to
go
I got to go


Once upon a time we fell apart
You're holding in your
hands
The two halves of my heart


Once upon a time
We weren't right

All we ever seemed to do is fight
On and on 
And on and on and on


Once
upon a time on the same side
Once upon a time on the same side
In the same game

Why'd you have to go
Have to go and throw it all in my face


I could've been a
princess, you'd be a king
Could have had a castle and wore a ring
But no
You
let me go
I could've been a princess, you'd be a king
Could have had a castle and wore
a ring
But no
You let me go


You stole my star
La la la la la
la
You stole my star
La la la la la la


'Cause you really hurt me

Oh you really hurt me
'Cause you really hurt me
Oh you really hurt me
'Cause
you really hurt me
Oh you really hurt me
'Cause you really hurt me
You really
hurt me
