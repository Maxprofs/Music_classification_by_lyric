Blues/Jazz|

                        Maybe I'm old fashioned, feeling as I do
 Maybe I am living in the past
 But when I meet the right one
 I know that I'll be true
 My first love will be the last When I fall in love it will be forever
 Or I'll never fall in love
 In a restless world like this is
 Love is ended before it began
 And too many moonlight kisses
 Seem to cool in the warmth of the sun When I give my heart it will be completely
 Or I'll never, never, never give my heart
 And the moment I can feel that you feel that way too
 Is when I give my heart to you
                        
                    |
