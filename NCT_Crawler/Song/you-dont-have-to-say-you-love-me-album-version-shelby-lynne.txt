                        Bài hát: You Don'T Have To Say You Love Me(Album Version) - Shelby Lynne

When I said I needed you
You said
You would always stay
It wasn't me
Who changed but you
And now you've gone away

Don't you see
That now you've gone
And I'm left here on my own
That I have to follow you
And beg you to come home?

[Chorus]
No, you don't have
To say you love me
Just be close at hand
You don't have
To stay forever
I will understand
Believe me, believe me
I can't help but love you
And believe me
I will never tie you down

Left alone
With just a memory
Life seems dead
And so unreal
There's nothing
Left but loneliness

There's nothing
Left to feel

[Chorus]

You don't have
To say you love me
Oh, just be close
At hand
No, you don't have
To stay forever
I will understand
Believe me [2x]
Oh, believe me [2x]
Believe me
Oh believe me [2x]
Ooooh
                        
                    |
