Lost from the start,
I might as well be on the moon
Much colder than I thought
Even in the month of June
No communication makes ya feel so alone
Well all we need is patience in which I've never really known

But now it's too late,
It's taking over me
It feels so supernatural
And I'm pulled the other way
It's more than I can take
And I'm losing hold of everything
And no matter how I try
You know I can't deny
'Cause you feel so supernatural

Every step I've taken has
Led me here to where you are
But all that I believe in is
Keeping me from seeing too far
Throwing out the questions,
Waiting for the right reply
Looking for the answers,
Tell me will it be tonight?

But now it's too late,
It's taking over me
It feels so supernatural
And I'm pulled the other way
It's more than I can take
And I'm losing hold of everything
When it's more than physical
It's kind of hard to see beyond the glow
And no matter how I try
You know I can't deny
'Cause you feel so supernatural
Through the atmosphere I'm seeing
Glimpses of the past I'm leaving
Holding on for life as we collide

Now it's too late,
It's taking over me
It feels so supernatural
And I'm pulled the other way
It's more than I can take
And I'm losing hold of everything
When it's more than physical
It's kind of hard to see beyond the glow
And no matter how I try
You know I can't deny
'Cause you feel so supernatural
'Cause you feel so supernatural

'Cause you feel so supernatural

'Cause you feel so supernatural

'Cause you feel so supernatural
