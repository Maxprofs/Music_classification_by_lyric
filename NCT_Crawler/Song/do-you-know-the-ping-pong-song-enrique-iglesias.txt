                        Bài hát: Do You Know? (The Ping Pong Song) - Enrique Iglesias

Do you know?
Do you know?
Do you know?

Do you know what it feels like loving someone
Thats in a rush to throw you away?
(Do you know? Do you know? Do you know? Do you?)
Do you know what it feels like to be the last one
To know the lock on the door has changed
(Do you know? Do you know? Do you know? Do you?)

If birds flying south's a sign of changes
At least you can predict this every year
Love, you never know the minute it ends
Suddenly I cant get it to speak

Maybe find you all the things it took to save us
I could fix the pain that bleeds inside of me
Look in your eyes 'til I see there's something about me
Im standing on the edge and I dont know what else to give

Do you know what it feels like loving someone
Thats in a rush to throw you away?
(Do you know? Do you know? Do you know? Do you?)
Do you know what it feels like to be the last one
To know the lock on the door has changed
(Do you know? Do you know? Do you know? Do you?)

How can I love you? How can I love you?
How can I love you? How can I love you?
If you just dont talk to me, babe

I flow through my act, there's a question, "Is she needed?"
Another side of a man I cannot be
Looking at the last 3 years like I did
I could never see us ending like this

(Do you know?)
Seeing your face no more on my pillow
Is a scene thats never happened to me
(Do you know?)
But after this episode I dont see
You can never tell how the next day of life could be

Do you know what it feels like loving someone
Thats in a rush to throw you away?
(Do you know? Do you know? Do you know? Do you?)
Do you know what it feels like to be the last one
To know the lock on the door has changed
(Do you know? Do you know? Do you know? Do you?)

Do you know what it feels like loving someone
Thats in a rush to throw you away?
(Do you know? Do you know? Do you know? Do you?)
Do you know what it feels like to be the last one
To know the lock on the door has changed
(Do you know? Do you know? Do you know? Do you?)

Do you know?
Do you know?
Do you know?
Do you know?

Do you know what it feels like loving someone
Thats in a rush to throw you away?
(Do you know? Do you know? Do you know? Do you?)
Do you know what it feels like to be the last one
To know the lock on the door has changed
(Do you know? Do you know? Do you know? Do you?)

Do you know what it feels like loving someone
(You dont know know it feels)
Thats in a rush to throw you away?
(You dont know know it feels)
Do you know what it feels like to be the last one
(You dont know know it feels)
To know the lock on the door has changed
(You dont know know it feels)
(Do you know? Do you know? Do you know? Do you?)
