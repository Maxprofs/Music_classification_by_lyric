                        From the streets of Miami, to presenting at the Grammys
Con el multito de Jennifer, maybe now you understand me

Clap your hands, go clap your hands, go clap your hands to the beat (x2)

Mr. Worldwide, RedOne, and the beautiful Jennifer Lopez
Dale

We don’t believe in defeat, that’s why we’re back for a threepeat
Hi Jenny, mira que esta loco
Yo me locomo como pastelitos de Coco
I get stupid on a beach, see wowo
I got mommies, mommies by the boatload
Yo tengo la carne y ella el mojo
I’m sayin’ dale, she’s screamin’ “YOLO”
She’s Little Red Riding Hood and guess whose el lobo (me la como)?
Whose name is globally known?
Whose name on the check and they’re adding an O?
Whose name on the blimp when the world is yours?
Whose name on the schools, slam fo’ sho’!
I know it’s hard to understand how a boy grew to a man
Man turned to a brand
But guess what, here I am
Jenny from the block, let’s rock

[Verse 1]
Yeah push me harder, I do the same
Boy I wanna feel you in every way
Don’t even wonder it’s just a game
We’re rockin’ body to body, let’s go insane

[Bridge]
I hit the spotlight, all night, ready to go
Give you a hard night, so tight, ready to blow
I’m in the spotlight, all night, ready to go
Give you a hard night, so tight, ready to blow

[Chorus]
Oh, we can do anything we want
Live it up, so live it up, live it up, go
Oh, and we ain’t stoppin’ ’till we’re done
Live it up, so live it up, live it up
Go, go, go, etc.

[Spoken]
Make love, don’t fight
Let’s f**k tonight

[Verse 2]
Turn up this mother and let it play (mami)
I know you like my bumper, don’t be ashamed (que rico)
Don’t even wonder it’s just a game (mami)
We’re rockin’ body to body, let’s go insane (que rico)

[Bridge]
I hit the spotlight, all night, ready to go
Give you a hard night, so tight, ready to blow
I’m in the spotlight, all night, ready to go
Give you a hard night, so tight, ready to blow

[Chorus]
Oh, we can do anything we want
Live it up, so live it up, live it up, go
Oh, and we ain’t stoppin’ ’till we’re done
Live it up, so live it up, live it up
Go, go, go, etc.

[Spoken]
Make love, don’t fight
Let’s f**k tonight

[Spoken]
You name it, she’s done it
She’s the reason that women run it
Bet this on a Grammy
Maybe now you understand me

Clap your hands, go clap your hands, go clap your hands to the beat (x3)

[Chorus]
Oh, we can do anything we want
Live it up, so live it up, live it up, go
Oh, and we ain’t stoppin ’till we’re done
Live it up, so live it up, live it up
Go, go, go, etc.

[Spoken]
Let’s hook tonight (x2)
