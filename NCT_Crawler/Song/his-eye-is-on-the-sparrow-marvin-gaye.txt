                        Why should I feel so discouraged
 I wanna know why should the shadow come
 Oh tell me why why should I feel lonely, so lonely
 And long for heaven and a home Since Jesus is my portion
 A constant friend he is
 His eye is on the sparrow
 And I know he watches over me
 His eye is on the sparrow
 And I know he watches over me I sing because I'm happy
 And I sing because I'm free
 His eye is on the sparrow
 And I know Jesus watches me
                        
                    |
