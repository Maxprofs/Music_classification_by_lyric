                        The visions around you
Bring tears to your eyes
And all that surrounds you
Are secrets and lies

I'll be your strength, I'll give you hope
Keepin' your faith when it's cold
The one you should call
Standing here all alone

And I will take you in my arms
And hold you right where you belong
Till the day my life is through
This I promise you, this I promise you

I've loved you forever
In lifetimes before
And I promised you never
Would you hurt anymore

I give you my word, I give you my heart
(Give you my heart)
This is a battle we've won
And with this vow
Forever has now begun

Just close your eyes
(Just close your eyes)
Each loving day
(Each loving day)
And know this feeling won't go away
(No)
Till the day my life is through
This I promise you, this I promise you

Over and over I fall
(Over and over I fall)
When I hear you call
Without you in my life, baby
I just wouldn’t be livin’ at all

And I will take you in my arms
(And I will take you in my arms )
And hold you right where you belong
(Right where you belong)
Till the day my life is through
This I promise you, babe, yeah

Just close your eyes each loving day
And know this feeling won't go away
Every word I say is true
This I promise you

Every word I say is true
This I promise you, I promise you
I promise you
                        
                    |
