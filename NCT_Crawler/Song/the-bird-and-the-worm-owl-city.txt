                        The Bird And The Worm lyrics
Songwriters: Theissen, Matt; Young, Adam; 

If you're the bird whenever we pretend it's summer
Then I'm the worm, I know the part, it's such a bummer
But fair is fair, if my segments get separated
I'll scream and you'll be there

Close your eyes, close my eyes
Slide the cotton off of your shoulder
And feel the shine, feel the shine
I'm hooked so toss me over and cast a line, oh I'll try
Oh, throw a party and greet my undersea friends
It depends, as they arrive, if they arrive

You and I left our troubles far behind, troubles far behind
But I still have just one more question on my mind
For all my pals who live in the oceans and the seas
With friends like these well, who needs enemies

If I'm your boy, let's take a short cut we remember
And we'll enjoy, picking apples in late September
Like we've done for years
Then we'll take a long walk through the corn field
And I'll kiss you between the ears

If you're my girl, swirl me around your room with feeling
And as we twirl, the glow in the dark stars on your ceiling
Will shine for us, as love sweeps over the room
'Cause we tend to make each other blush, you make me blush

You and I left our troubles far behind, troubles far behind
But I still have just one more question on my mind
For all my pals who live in the oceans and the seas
With fronds like these well, who needs anemones?

You're the bird and I'm the worm and it's plain to see
That we were meant to be

We were meant to be
We were meant to be

If you're the bird
If you're the bird
Then I'm the worm
We were meant to be
                        
                    |
