                        Bài hát: Beautiful Day - Joshua Radin

I'm gonna wash the dust off my soul
I'm gonna listen to some rock n' roll
No cares, come what may
I'm making a beautiful day

I'm gonna drive my car into the sea
Swim out far cause I believe that the waves will wash the gray away
I'm making a beautiful day
But let me hear you say

[Chorus:]
Oooh ooohh my my
I'm learning to fly
Hey hey what's that you're saying
Lets not forget we're alive

Gonna climb that hill behind my house
See what this place is all about
Cause from above it all
You can't help but say
It's gonna be a beautiful day
It's gonna be a beautiful day
But let me hear you say

[Chorus]

Gonna turn my enemies into friends
Was broken yet stronger when it mends
When we all come together this song will play
We'll sing it's a beautiful day
And it's gonna be my beautiful day

[Chorus]
