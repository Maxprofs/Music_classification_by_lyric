                        He says, have no fear 
Open up, let me in 
He says, take a chance 
Here's your song, time to dance 

What you gonna do, when it comes for you 

Listen to your heart 
You gotta listen, to your heart 
Listen to your heart 
Why don't you listen to your heart 

He says, here's your sky, don't look down 
We can fly 
You say, you little biscuit 
Just hold on, almost there 

What you gonna do, when it comes for you 
Listen to your heart 
You gotta listen, to your heart 
Listen to your heart 
Why don't you listen to your heart 

You never know until you try 
Why so scared, when hearts don't lie 
Turn off the world, and close your eyes 
Lose yourself, and 

Listen to your heart 
You gotta listen, to your heart 
Listen to your heart 
Why don't you listen to your heart 

You know what to do when it comes for you 

You gotta listen baby 
Gotta listen baby gotta listen baby 
Gotta listen to it 
How can you hear it 
Gotta listen baby
