[00:-2.00]Daughtry - Tennessee Line
[00:-1.00]

I open my lungs
To breathe in forgiveness and love
Haunting me now
Reminders of how I used to be

And on down the road
My troubles are sure to follow
Looking out the window,
The hell if I know where I will go
So I'll just keep on driving

On my way to L.A.
Looking into the rear view
As the roads fade away
I've sworn off my past,
First to last bad call that I ever made
Tell me how to make right
Every wrong turn that I've learned
So this can all end tonight
Tennessee line (Tennessee line)
Just changed my mind ,
Well it's my heart I'll follow this time

Who would've known (who would've known)
That pride is so hard to swallow
As I rest on the shoulder of a road growing colder
With the trouble I own,
Should I just keep on driving?

On my way to L.A.
Looking into the rear view
As the roads fade away
I've sworn off my past,
First to last bad call that I ever made
Tell me how to make right
Every wrong turn that I've learned
So this can all end tonight
Tennessee line (Tennessee line)
Just changed my mind,
Well it's my heart I'll follow this time
I know I must be doing something right
Head the other way, back to where I started out
Ask myself if I can turn it all around tonight
And stop living with doubt (yeahh)

On my way to L.A.
Looking into the rear view
As the roads fade away
I've sworn off my past,
First to last bad call that I ever made

Tell me how to make right
Every wrong turn that I've learned
So this can all end tonight
Tennessee line (Tennessee line)
Just changed my mind ,
Well it's my heart I'll follow this time
I've sworn off my past,
First to last bad call that I ever made
(Well it's my heart I'll follow this time)
I've sworn off my past,
First to last bad call that I ever made
I'm gonna turn it all around tonight
(Turn it all around tonight)
(Turn it all around tonight)

I'm gonna turn it all around tonight
At the Tennessee line.
