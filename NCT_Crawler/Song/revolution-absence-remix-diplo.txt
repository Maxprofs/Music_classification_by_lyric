                        Bài hát: Revolution (Absence Remix) - Diplo

Can you see it ?
The worst is over
The monster in my head
Are scared of love
Fallen people , listen up!
It's never too late
To change your luck

So don't let them
Steal your light
Don't let them
Break your stride
There's light on the other side
And you'll see all the raindrops falling behind

It's a revolution
And we'll make it out tonight
It's a revolution

Can you see it ?
The worst is over
The monster in my head
Are scared of love
Fallen people , listen up!
It's never too late
To change your luck

So don't let them
Steal your light
Don't let them
Break your stride
There's light on the other side
And you'll see all the raindrops falling behind

It's a revolution
And we'll make it out tonight
It's a revolution
                        
                    |
