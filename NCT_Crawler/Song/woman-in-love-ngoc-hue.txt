                        Woman In Love

Songwriters: GIBB, BARRY ALAN/GIBB, ROBIN HUGH

Life is a moment in space
When the dream is gone
Its a lonelier place
I kiss the morning goodbye
But down inside you know
We never know why
The road is narrow and long
When eyes meet eyes
And the feeling is strong
I turn away from the wall
I stumble and fall
But I give you it all...
Chorus:
I am a woman in love
And I do anything
To get you into my world
And hold you within
Its a right I defend
Over and over again
What do I do? 

With you eternally mine
In love there is
No measure of time
We planned it all at the start
That you and i
Would live in each others hearts
We may be oceans away
You feel my love
I hear what you say
No truth is ever a lie
I stumble and fall
But I give you it all
Repeat chorus
I am a woman in love
And Im talking to you
Do you know how it feels? 
What a woman can do
Its a right
That I defend over and over again......
                        
                    |
