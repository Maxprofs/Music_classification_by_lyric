                        [Lloyd - Chorus]
 Girl I wanna be the one, be be be the one
 Girl I wanna be the one
 Be the one to kiss you goodnight
 Be the one, be be be be the one
 Girl I wanna be the one, be the one
 Girl I wanna be the one, be be be the one
 Girl I wanna be the one, be the one to kiss you goodnight A lil sunshine, Open my eyes
 Wake up in the morning, she on my mind
 Get fresh, get dressed
 The world, it's my time
 So you can think about your soul
 Cause you know we on
 So let me turn off that phone
 We aint gotta stop we grown
 And I don't really give a f-ck who's calling
 I don't really give a f-ck who's ballin'
 Call me A. Keys, who's Fallin'
 You's fallin', thats dude's problem
 So hop in this thang
 Forget what he said
 Wanna taste my favorite spread
 my lips between your legs [Lloyd - Chorus] [Trey Songz]
 i get a call, midnight ball. I'm headed over there
 You better be prepared
 Pullin' on ya hair
 No kiddin', no trippin'
 My dog and yo kitten
 My head in yo mitten
 If you take it than I'm gon' give it
 If you throw it, then I'm gon hit it
 I'm aint gon miss it, it's my mission I'ma kiss on every lip of yours
 What now, touch down, your body like a score
 Get it, I'ma get it like you never did before [Chorus] [Young Jeezy]
 Look, Lloyd got me on these?
 So all you see is these ? rappers
 Coconut kush, cocnut ciroc
 Not behind the wheel, coconut the top
 Get it? yeah I said nothing
 Talk back to her, like what
 Aint nothing sweet in my sweet
 See I start off slow, go deep
 Got an uptown ?, it's over
 I told ya, she my soldier
 Yeh, Young be the boss
 Everyday of the week I floss
 Look off white rocks, no denim
 Look off white drop, no rental
 Yeah, top down in the winter
 Say I ball too hard, Sportscenter
 I'm in the club with my ice out
 Start blowing up my iPhone
 Like where ya at? where ya been?
 What ya doing tonight, can you hit it again
 From the back, while I'm on the scene
 While you smoking blunts while ya drinking drinks
 While ya other broads blowing up ya phone
 While ya pulling my hair with ya Nike's on [Lloyd - Chorus]
