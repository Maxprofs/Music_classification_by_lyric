                        Bài hát: Don't Drink The Water - Brad Paisley, Blake Shelton 

Empty house, Empty Rooms, Empty bottle of Petron
I need to go out but not around here
There ain't nowhere we haven't gone
There's this travel agent that I know who says Cozumel is real nice
And so he got me a deal on a flight and a room and a little bit of free advice

Don't drink the water
I told him that's ok
I ain't going down
To Mexico to drink the water anyway

Blake ain't you been there yeah
(Blake) I've been there a time or two
They got some sweet Senoritas
That are more than glad to meet you
But I'm tellin you boy that whatever you do

Don't drink the water
Ok ok
I ain't going down
To Mexico to drink the water anyway

Corona or Tecate or my old friend Jose
I ain't going down
To Mexico to drink the water anyway

On this trip anything I sip better have a kick and a burn
Strong enough to get you off my mind
Little by little and a little grub of worm

Don't drink the water
That's what they say
I ain't going down
To Mexico to drink the water anyway

No one I know goes to Mexico
To drink the water anyway
