                        [ti:]That Ole Devil Called Love
[ar:]Alison Moyet
[al:]My Heart Will Go On
That Ole Devil Called Love
It's that ole devil called love again
Gets behind me and keeps giving me that shove again
Putting rain in my eyes, tears in my dreams
And rocks in my heart
It's that sly old son of a gun again
He keeps telling me I'm the lucky one again
But I still have that rain
Still have those tears
And those rocks on my heart
S'pose I didn't stay
Run away wouldn't play
The devil what a potion he would brew
He'd follow me round
Build me up
Tear me down
Till I'll be so bewildered
I wouldn't know what to do
Might as well give up that fight again
I know darn well he'll convince me that he's right again
When he sings that sorry song
I've just gotta tag along
With that ole devil called love
He'd follow me round
Build me up
Tear me down
Till I'll be so bewildered
I wouldn't know what to do
Might as well give up that fight again
I know darn well he'll convince me that he's right again
When he sings that sorry song
I've just gotta tag along
With that ole devil called love
With that ole devil called love
