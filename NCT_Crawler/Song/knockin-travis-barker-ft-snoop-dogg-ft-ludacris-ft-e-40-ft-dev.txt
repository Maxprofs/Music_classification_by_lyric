 You-you feel the bass
 You-you-you-you feel the bass
 You-you feel the bass
 You-you-you-you feel the bass Cruisin' down the boulevard, feelin' hella good
 Smokin' while I'm drivin', you would if you could
 So I'ma push, smokin' on this Reggie Bush
 Avoidin' the P's, steady tryin' to hit it
 (Hit it) Jesus G's, you niggas don't get it
 And she's a tease, you're never gonna hit it
 She say she wanna keep her clothes on
 I'm not a drummer but this summer the beat goes on I told her, let me flip this ***, then I'll dip this ***
 Then I'll hit this ***, I'm the magnificent
 Equivalent to no other, relevant to recover
 Sell that *** to your mother Tell me can, you hear, me knockin', knock, knock-knockin'
 I make you feel, be-beat droppin', drop, drop-droppin'
 The bass is bangin' out, the place, place, is bangin' out
 So can, you hear, me-me knock, knock, kn-knock-knockin' Me, Luda, yo
 (Woo) You beat it like Ike Turner, I swang it like A-Rod
 Up and comin' rappers better keep they fuckin' day job
 'Cause I'm the best so they got me mistooken
 So clock in and watch this lyrical ass whoopin' 'Cause they got flows that make hoes sleepy like slow jams
 My *** rocks
 (Cocaine)
 Like Lindsay Lohan
 Listen to Luda in the Cadillac Broug-ham
 Try to turn me down and your nigga's like, "No, man" Don't you ever touch a black man's radio
 'Specially when Luda bust rhymes in scenario
 Plat' plaques from Rio to Ontario
 Bustin' through your speakers like Tyson's in your stereo, go Tell me can, you hear, me knockin', knock, knock-knockin'
 I make you feel, be-beat droppin', drop, drop-droppin'
 The bass is bangin' out, the place, place, is bangin' out
 So can, you hear, me-me knock, knock, kn-knock-knockin' Ugh, I'll plug jumper cables to the bridge
 (Bay Area)
 Put your lights back in this bitch
 (Bitch) West Coast representative from the label they call Sick Wid It
 The best that ever lived it and spit it
 And *** around and got away with it
 (Got away with it) Ugh, ever since the 80's I've been paved with it
 Overlooked and underrated
 Gotta keep it real wit y'all, I can't fake it
 (I can't fake it) Ugh, I be off-beat then I'm on-beat
 Then I'm off-beat then I'm on-beat
 And my style is so unique I gotta have one teeth in my mouth
 And sweep a broad up off her feet
 (Feet) Took her down on the couch
 Before I had a chance to speak
 (Speak) Skeeted all in her mouth
 And then we went for round three
 (Three)
 We was tied just like the soap opera
 At the same time reached our peak Tell me can, you hear, me knockin', knock, knock-knockin'
 I make you feel, be-beat droppin', drop, drop-droppin'
 The bass is bangin' out, the-the bass is bangin' out
 So can, you hear, me-me knock, knock, kn-knock-knockin' Knockin', knock, knock-knockin'
 Knock, knockin', knock kn-kn knockin'
 The bass is knockin'
 The bass is knockin' Bustin' through your speakers
