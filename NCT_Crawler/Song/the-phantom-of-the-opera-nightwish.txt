                        In sleep he sang to me, in dreams he came 
That voice which calls to me and speaks my name 
And do I dream again? For now I find 
Phantom of the opera is there inside my mind
Sing once again with me, our strange duet 
My power over you grows stronger yet 
And though you turn from me to glance behind 
The Phantom of the opera is there inside your mind
Those who have seen your face draw back in fear 
I am the mask you wear, it's me they hear 
Your spirit and my voice in one combined
The Phantom of the opera is there inside your mind
He's there, the phantom of the opera 
Beware, the phantom of the opera
Where all your fantasies, you always knew 
That man and mystery lay both in you 
And in this labyrinth where night is blind 
The Phantom of the opera is here inside your mind
Sing, my angel of music
 He's there the Phantom of the opera
                        
                    |
