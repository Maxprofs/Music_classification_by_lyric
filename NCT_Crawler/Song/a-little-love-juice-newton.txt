                        Bài hát: A Little Love - Juice Newton

You say a little love isn't enough for you
Sometimes I feel lucky just to get a little coming through

I weigh the differences everyday
Sometimes I feel like running away
A little love here makes me want to stay
A little love there will keep me from running away
A little love here, A little love there
Give a little, Get a little, Just a little love
A little love here, A little love there
Give a little, Get a little, Just a little love

Well you thought you had it beat, but it didn't seem to last that long
Now you're back out on the street but you've got to keep hanging on

I weigh the differences everyday
Sometimes I feel like running away
A little love here makes me want to stay
A little love there will keep me from running away
A little love here, A little love there
Give a little, Get a little, Just a little love
A little love here, A little love there
Give a little, Get a little, Just a little love

Well I know it's hard my friend, but the hurt can heal and your heart will mend
And this world keeps dragging you down, 
But love can bring you round and round and round and round again

I weigh the differences everyday
Sometimes I feel like running
Sometimes I feel like running away
A little love here makes me want to stay
Just a little love
A little love there will keep me from running away
A little love here, A little love there
Give a little, Get a little, Just a little love
A little love here, A little love there
Give a little, Get a little, Just a little love
A little love here, A little love there
Give a little, Get a little, Just a little love
A little love here, A little love there
Give a little, Get a little, Just a little love
                        
                    |
