                        Bài hát : Autumn Leaves - Patricia Barber

Those autumn leaves go past my window.
Those autumn leaves of red and gold.

I see your lips those summer kisses,
Those sunburned hands I used to hold.

Since you went away the nights grow long,
And soon I'll yearn old winter's song

But I'll miss you most of all, my darling
When autumn leaves start to fall
                        
                    |
