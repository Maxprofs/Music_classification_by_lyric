                        Bài Hát: Is It A Crime
Trình Bày: Sade
It may come, it may come as some surprise
but I miss you
I could see through all of your lies
but still I miss you
he takes her love, but it doesn't feel like mine
he tastes her kiss, her kisses are not wine, they're not mine
he takes, but surely she can't give what I'm feeling now
she takes, but surely she doesn't know how
Is it a crime
Is it a crime
that I still want you
and I want you to want me too
My love is wider, wider than Victoria Lake
My love is taller, taller than the empire state
It dives and it jumps and it ripples like the deepest ocean
I can't give you more than that, surely you want me back
Is it a crime
Is it a crime
that I still want you
and I want you to want me too
My love wider than Victoria Lake
taller than the empire state
It dives and it jumps
I can't give you more than that, surely you want me back
Is it a crime
Is it a crime
that I still want you
and I want you to want me too
