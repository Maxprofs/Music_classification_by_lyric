                        The preacher talked to me and he smiled,
Said, come and walk with me, come and walk one more mile.
Now for once in your life you're alone,
But you aint got a dime, there's no time for the phone.

Ive just got to get a message to you, hold on, hold on.
One more hour and my life will be through, hold on, hold on.

I told him Im in no hurry,
But if I broke her heart, wont you tell her Im sorry.
And for once in my life Im alone,
And Ive got to let her know just in time before I go.

Ive just go to get a message to you, hold on, hold on.
One more hour and my life will be through, hold on, hold on.

Well I laughed but that didn't hurt,
And it's only her love that keeps me wearing this dirt.
Now Im crying but deep down inside,
Well I did it to him, now it's my turn to die.

Ive just got to get a message to you, hold on, hold on.
One more hour and my life will be through, hold on, hold on.
