                        Did I not love you,
Before this lifetime?
Did you
never hear,
My music in your soul?

Did I not need you,
Beyond forever?
And now I'll leave you...
Not for ever more

The widest ocean,
I have crossed over,
No boat did I row,
But love to carry ne;
I have been ever,
In constant motion,
I have been finding you, Eternally.

And I've been travelling,
Throughout the ages,
Down through the pages,
Of history
Just for this moment,
This timeless moment,
This wondrous moment...
Of you and me.

Did I not love you,
Before this lifetime?
Did you never hear,
My music in your soul?

Did I not need you,
Beyond forever?
And now I'll leave you...
Not for ever more

Did I not need you,
Beyond forever?
And now I'll leave you...
Not for ever more... And I will leave you...
Not for ever more
                        
                    |
