                        I remember a meadow one morning in May
 With a sky full of dreams that sailed in that day
 I was dancing through green waves of grass like the sea
 And for a moment in time I could feel I was free There are waves of forgiveness and waves of regret
 And the first waves of true love I'll never forget
 In the meadow that morning as I wandered alone
 There were green waves of yearning for life still unknown Take me home to the meadow that cradles my heart
 Where the waves reach as far as you can see
 Take me home to the meadow we've been too long apart
 I can still hear you calling for me Take me home to the meadow that cradles my heart
 Where the waves reach as far as you can see
 Take me home to the meadow we've been too long apart
 I can still hear you calling for me What I'd give to remember that heavenly state
 Just a moment in time all mine to create
 As I'm taking my last breath I know what I will see
 There'll be green waves forever out there waiting for me Take me home to the meadow that cradles my heart
 Where the waves reach as far as you can see
 Take me home to the meadow we've been too long apart
 I can still hear you calling for me
                        
                    |
