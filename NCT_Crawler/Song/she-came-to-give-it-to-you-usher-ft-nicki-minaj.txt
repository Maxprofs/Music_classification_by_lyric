                        Bài hát: She Came To Give It To You - Usher, Nicki Minaj

[Verse 1: Usher]
Said it ain’t what you do cause
(Everybody knows what's up cause everybody wanna get next to me)
Said if you do what I do, she’ll be yours tonight
Imagine she can’t get a getaway
Well she don’t want nobody crowding her space
Wouldn’t that be weird? Aw yeah
She was up tonight to get down
But she don’t wanna be a part of the crowd
Wouldn’t that be weird? Aw yeah

[Pre-Hook: Usher]
I'm so confused, if you only knew she came to give it to you

[Hook: Usher]
It ain't what you do its what you do tonight
And there ain’t no shortcut to doing something right
Said if you do what I do, she’ll be yours tonight
Just look around the club cuz and have a good time

[Verse 2: Usher]
So many benefits to to being wild, just be cool enjoy the ride
‘Cause all you really wanna do is, wouldn’t that be weird? Yeah
Don’t be stingy with it pass the J, when I hit it this headache go away
My nigga, that’s weird

[Pre-Hook + Hook: Usher]

[Verse 3: Nicki Minaj]
Yo, he want the flirty girl, I'm the girly girl
You know who, get the worm it's the early bird
Flow, slicker than MJ, early curl
I got to clip these niggas like Sterly Sterl
I seen him in the club, he could get the cub
I ain't talking about baseball but go get the glove
Don't be like OJ and forget your glove
I'm tryna get faded nigga, go and get the drugs
Five plus five what they call that? Ten
Out in Japan we be counting that, Yen
Ladies who you trying to get it popping with? Men
No little boys in the circle of Usher
Got'em under pressure
When your girl come through, Nicki gone crush her
And tell your man play the back like a spine
He only last six seconds like a Vine

[Pre-Hook + Hook: Usher]

[Outro: Nicki Minaj]
Yo, I am Nicki M and he is Usher
All these niggas be tryna cuff her
What you know about that Swiffer duster
Until next time you motherfvcker
(Laughs)
