                        Bài hát: Anxiety - BlackBear, FRND

Every time you cross my mind you get right under my skin
Am I crazy out my mind the situation I'm in
And it gets harder just to breathe feel like the walls are closing in
All I need is some closure

Yeah, I can't eat, I can't sleep, I get anxiety
When you're not here with me, I get anxiety
I can't eat, I can't sleep, don't know why you can't see
You give me, you give me, give me

Give me anxiety

[FRND:]
Every time I smile what I'm doing fine does it show
Cause' I'm really freaking out too scared of letting you go
Then my heart drowns out my thoughts my head's about to explode
What I need is some closure

[Blackbear:]
I can't eat, I can't sleep, I get anxiety
When you're not here with me, I get anxiety
I can't eat, I can't sleep, don't know why you can't see
You give me, you give me, give me

Give me anxiety

(Anxiety, it feels way inside of me)

[Blackbear & FRND:]
(Every time I smile what I'm doing fine does it show
Cause' I'm really freaking out too scared of letting you go)
I can't eat, I can't sleep, I get anxiety
When you're not here with me, I get anxiety
I can't eat, I can't sleep, don't know why you can't see
You give me, you give me, give me anxiety

Anxiety
Give me anxiety
Anxiety
