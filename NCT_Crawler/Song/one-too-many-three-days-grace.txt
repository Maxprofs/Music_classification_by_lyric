                        Bài hát: One Too Many - Three Days Grace

Gotta get my hands on it
My hands on it
Gotta get my hands on a little bit more
Won't stop till I get it
Till I get it
Won't stop till I get a little bit more
Cause everybody wants
Everybody needs
Everybody wants
A little bit more
Everybody wants
Everybody needs
Everybody wants
A little bit more

One too many is never enough
One too many is never enough
When the one that kills you is the one that you love
One too many is never enough

What I wouldn't do for it
Do for it
What I wouldn't do for a little bit more
I'll give you what you want for it
Want for it
Give you what you want for a little bit more
Cause everybody wants
Everybody needs
Everybody wants
A little bit more
Everybody wants
Everybody needs
Everybody wants
A little bit more

One too many is never enough
One too many is never enough
When the one that kills you is the one that you love
One too many is never enough

And if I can't find the one thing to get me by for another night
Then I
Can't go on!
Can't go on!
Can't go on!

Cause everybody wants
Everybody needs
Everybody wants
A little bit more

One too many is never enough
One too many is never enough
When the one that kills you is the one that you love
One too many is never enough
                        
                    |
