                        [Hook 1: Nelly] I am so faded, might put fifty on the ladies
 100k tomorrow, money in the bag
 Im so faded, might put fifty on the ladies
 100k tomorrow, money in the bag
 [Verse 1: Nelly]
 50k today a 100 more tomorrow
 Hustle what I want man Ill forever ball
 Money coming heavy never weigh a little
 Its either high or low its never in the middle
 Ice buckets nigga for the gold Ace
 Big cash duffle bag with the gold lace
 Heard a nigga say throw in the towel
 Numbers speak the truth these niggas out here in denial. [Hook 2: Nelly] I am so faded, 10,000 square feet gated
 100k tomorrow, money in the bag
 Im so faded, might put fifty on the ladies
 100k tommorrow, money in the bag [Verse 2: Nelly] 50k today, 100k tomorrow
 Rollie Sundays, Monday Audomar
 Tuesday in the photo, Wednesday in the two door
 Thursdays made for *** Fridays back to getting you know
 You in that right place again
 Face not American, body saying African
 *** you with an uppercut, baby that wont take me long
 50k today we running money like a marathon
 Yo bread, yo bed, yo booty lights on
 Her phone playing your music like your music our songs
 Give her that banana clip most of all her clothes on
 Beatin on my chest went through the roof top [Hook 1] [Verse 3: 2 Chainz] So dope you could snort every line
 When its reppin time, whe when its reppin time
 Told her I take her shoppin after we ***
 Soon after we *** I had to tell her never mind
 You wouldnt know swag if it slapped you in the face
 This that macaroni tony A1 on the steak
 And designer shoe laces, gold on the bracelets
 Got her in the back seat balls on her braces
 Photo grails full of money stacks
 You a blocker and nigga I got a hundred sacks
 Ya, this the luxury distribution
 Up so early got me arguing with the rooster
 Tru university is my institution
 Niggas couldnt graduate if you had a tutor
 One thing for sure, two things for certain
 My crib got blinds, my car got curtains [Hook 1]
