                        Bài hát: Try (Giọng Hát Việt 2015) - Nguyễn Đức Phúc, Lê Hoàng Phong

Phúc: Ever wonder about what he's doing
How it all turned to lies
Sometimes I think that it's better... to never ask why

Phong: There, Funny, how the heart, can be deceiving
More than just a couple times
Why do we fall in love so easy
Even when it's not right

Phúc: So, Where there is desire
There is gonna be a flame
Where there is a flame
Someone's bound to get burned
Phong: But just because it burns
Doesn't mean you're gonna die
You've gotta get up and try and try and try
Phúc: You gotta get up and try and try and try
Phong: You gotta get up try try try

Phúc: Ever worried that it might be ruined
And does it make you wanna cry?
Phong: When you're out there doing what you're doing
Are you just getting by?
Tell me are you just getting by
Phúc: by by by by (Phong: by by)
Phúc: by by by by byyyyyyyyy (hey)

Phúc: So, Where there is desire
There is gonna be a flame
Where there is a flame
Someone's bound to get burned
But just because it burns
Doesn't mean you're gonna die
You've gotta get up and try and try and try.

Phong: Where there is desire
There is gonna be a flame
Where there is a flame
Someone's bound to get burned
But just because it burns
Doesn't mean you're gonna die
You've gotta get up and try and try and try.

Phong ft Phúc: You gotta get up and try and try and try
You gotta get up and try and try and try
Phúc: You gotta get up, You gotta get up, You gotta get up upppppppp hoh (Phong: and try and try and try)
Phong: You gotta get up (Phúc: get up so baby..)
Phong: You gotta get up (Phúc ft Phong: and try and try and try......)
