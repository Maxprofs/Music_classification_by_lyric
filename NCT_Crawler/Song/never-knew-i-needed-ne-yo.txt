                        #V1
For the way you changed my plans
For being the perfect distraction

For the way you took the idea that i had
of everything that i wanted to have
and made me see there was something missing...

For the ending of my first begin
(And) For the rare and unexpected friend

For the way you're something that I'd never choose
but at the same time something i don't wanna lose
and never wanna be without ever again...

#Chorus
You're the best thing I never knew I needed
when you appear i had no idea...

You're the best thing i never knew i needed
so now it's so clear i need you here, always...

#V2
My accidental happily (ever after)
The way you smile and how you comfort me (with your laughter)

I must admit you were not a part of my book
but now if you open it up and take a look
you're the beginning and the end of every chapter...

#Chorus
You're the best thing i never knew i needed
when you appear i had no idea...

You're the best thing i never knew i needed (that i needed)
so now it's so clear i need you here, always...

#B
Who knew knew that I could be...
So unexpectedly...
Undeniably happy (yeah)
With you right here, right here next to me...

#Chorus
You're the best thing i never knew i needed
when you appear i had no idea...

You're the best thing i never knew i needed (that i needed)
so now it's so clear i need you here, always...

...Now it's so clear, I need you here always.
