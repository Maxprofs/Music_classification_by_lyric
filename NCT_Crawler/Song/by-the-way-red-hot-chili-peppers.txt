                        Standing in line to see the show tonight
And there's a light on, heavy glow
By the way, I tried to say, I'd be there
Waiting for

Dani, the girl is singing songs to me
Beneath the marquee, overload

Steak Knife, Card Shark
Con Job, Boot Cut

Skin that flick
She's such a little DJ
Get there quick
By street but not the freeway

Turn that trick
To make a little leeway
Beat that nic
But not the way that we play

Dog Town, Blood Bath
Rib Cage, Soft Tail

Standing in line to see the show tonight
And there's a light on, heavy glow
By the way, I tried to say, I'd be there
Waiting for

Black Jack, Dope Dick
Pawn Shop, Quick Pick

Kiss that Dyke
I know you want to hold one
Not on strike
But I'm about to bowl one

Bite that mic
I know you never stole one
Girls that like
A story, so I told one

Song Bird, Main Line
Cash Back, Hard Top

Standing in line to see the show tonight
And there's a light on, heavy glow
By the way, I tried to say, I'd be there
Waiting for

Dani, the girl is singing songs to me
Beneath the marquee of her soul
By the way, I tried to say, I'd be there
Waiting for

[Incomprehensible]

Standing in line to see the show tonight
And there's a light on, heavy glow
By the way, I tried to say, I'd be there
Waiting for

Dani, the girl is singing songs to me
Beneath the marquee of her soul
By the way, I tried to say, I know you
From before

Standing in line to see the show tonight
And there's a light on, heavy glow
By the way, I tried to say, I'd be there
Waiting for
