feels so good being bad
there’s no way i’m turning back
now the pain is my pleasure
cause nothing could measure

love is great, love is fine
outta box, outta line
the affliction of the feeling
leaves me wanting more

cause i may be bad
but i’m perfectly good at it
sex in the air
i don’t care
i love the smell of it
sticks and stones
may break my bones
but chains and whips
excite me

na na na na
come on

i like it

i like it

come on
i like it
like it
come on
come on
come on
i like it
like it

just one night full of sin
feel the pain on your skin
ten bottles, scream mercy
it’s your turn to hurt me
yeah
if i’m bad tell me that
shut me up, gag and bound me
cos the pain is my pleasure
nothing comes better
yeah

cause i may be bad
but i’m perfectly good at it
sex in the air
i don’t care
i love the smell of it
sticks and stones
may break my bones
but chains and whips
excite me

na na na na
come on

come on
come on
i like it
like it
come on
come on
come on
i like it

i like it

come on
i like it

s...s...s
and
M M M
s...s...s
and love the feeling
you bring to me
oh, you turn me on
it’s exactly what
i’ve been yearning for
give it to
                        
                    |
