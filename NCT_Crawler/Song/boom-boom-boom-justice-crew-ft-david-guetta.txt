Boom boom

Boom boom

Boom boom

Woo!

Okay, the gang's all here
And everything feels alright
Ladies, the drinks on me
Yeah, we can do shots all night
That's right, I'm on that ***
(I'm on it)
And it's about to go go down
All night, we ain't gon' quit
And all I need is a few more chicks
(Let's go)

Yeah, ladies we drop it
So no man is hot in it
And we got money
To blow oh oh
The party is rockin'
The whole crew is poppin'
We own this, we got this
Let's go oh oh

Callin' all sexy girls
All around the world
Look at that aeroplane fly
Up on cloud nine
Damn you so sexy ooh
And the things you do
Drive me out of my mi-mi-mind
And the party goes boom boom boom

New York to Cali

Them girls be slammin'
And the party goes boom boom boom

So sexy fly
'Cause the party goes boom boom boom

Damn girl you were ten, oh my
And you keep looking at me
No wings, but you still fly
If you got a man tell him bye bye bye

Yeah, ladies we drop it
So no man is hot in it
And we got money
To blow oh oh
The party is rockin'
The whole crew is poppin'
We own this, we got this
Let's go oh oh

Callin' all sexy girls
All around the world
Look at that aeroplane fly
Up on cloud nine
Damn you so sexy ooh
And the things you do
Drive me out of my mi-mi-mind
