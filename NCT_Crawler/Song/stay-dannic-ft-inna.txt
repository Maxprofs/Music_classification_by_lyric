                        Bài hát: Stay - Dannic, INNA

[Verse 1]
Wait
I heard you were leaving, won't you stay
Cause I gotta feeling, you can change
So you don't need anybody, no, anybody

[Pre-Chorus]
Cause you never thought that I'll be in there for the long, run
And if you wanna go, you know I'll let you go on
Whenever some people telling me that you and I are fun
Cause they never seen your side the way that I don't

[Chorus]
I want you to stay
Stay-ay, stay-ay-ay, Um
I want you to stay
Stay-ay, stay-ay-ay

[Verse 2]
Um, it may be your face
So drop me in your gab to the bay
Now I'll prove you're wrong, I'm wide awake
Cause I know you need somebody, anybody

[Pre-Chorus]
Cause you never thought that I'll be in there for the long, run
And if you wanna go, you know I'll let you go on
Whenever some people telling me that you and I are fun
Cause they never seen your side the way that I don't

[Chorus]
I want you to stay
Stay-ay, stay-ay-ay, Um
I want you to stay
Stay-ay, stay-ay-ay

[Bridge]
And maybe one day
The doubts in your mind will slowly fade
And you and me be in better place
Cause I know we'll be together, yeah, we're forever

[Pre-Chorus]
Cause you never thought that I'll be in there for the long, run
And if you wanna go, you know I'll let you go on
Whenever some people telling me that you and I are fun
Cause they never seen your side the way that I don't

[Chorus]
I want you to stay
Stay-ay, stay-ay-ay, mmm
I want you to stay
Stay-ay, stay-ay-ay
                        
                    |
