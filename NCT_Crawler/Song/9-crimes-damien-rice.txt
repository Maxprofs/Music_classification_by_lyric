                        Leave me out with the waste
This is not what I do
It's the wrong kind of place
To be thinking of you
It's the wrong time
For somebody new
It's a small crime
And I've got no exuse

Is that alright? Yeah
To give my gun away when it's loaded
Is that alright? Yeah
If you don't shoot it how am I supposed to hold it
Is that alright? Yeah
To give my gun away when it's loaded
Is that alright
Is that alright with you?

Leave me out with the waste
This is not what I do
It's the wrong kind of place
To be cheating on you
It's the wrong time
But she's pulling me through
It's a small crime
And I've got no exuse

Is that alright? Yeah
Give my gun away when it's loaded
Is that alright? Yeah
If u dont shoot it how am i supposed to hold it
Is that alright? Yeah
Give my gun away when it's loaded
Is that alright
Is that alright with you?

Is that alright?
Is that alright?
Is that alright with you?
Is that alright?
Is that alright?
Is that alright with you?

No...
