                        Bài hát: Lovesick Fool - The Cab

Who are you? You’re looking like a stranger
You were once my love and my savior
Now I’m left with nothing but your makeup
On my pillow

And I can’t sleep, the pills they never helped
Tried counting sheep, still hurts like hell
I can’t believe this rose has lost its red
And its petals

Who put that rock in your chest, won’t you tell me?
If I said I wished you the best, I was lying

[Chorus]
Waking up just brings me down (down)
Cause every morning you are nowhere to be found (nowhere to be found)
And my bed is half empty not half full
I’d rather live with broken bones
Then lay here all on my own like a lovesick fool

Like a lovesick fool [x3]

Where’d you go?
You said you’ll never leave me
All alone, my heart is barely beating
Like a ghost you haunt me every day that you’re gone

I’m not the same
Now something went missing
There’s a cage, it feels like a prison
Here, I’ll stay until you come back home (home)

Who put that rock in your chest, won’t you tell me?
If I said I wished you the best, I was lying

[Chorus]
Waking up just brings me down (down)
Cause every morning you are nowhere to be found (nowhere to be found)
And my bed is half empty not half full
I’d rather live with broken bones
Then lay here all on my own like a lovesick fool

Am I a lovesick fool?
Or am I giving up?
Am I a lovesick fool?

Waking up just brings me down (down)
Cause every morning you are nowhere to be found (nowhere to be found)

[Chorus]
Waking up just brings me down (down)
Cause every morning you are nowhere to be found (nowhere to be found)
And my bed is half empty not half full
I’d rather live with broken bones
Then lay here all on my own like a lovesick fool

Like a lovesick fool [x3]
                        
                    |
