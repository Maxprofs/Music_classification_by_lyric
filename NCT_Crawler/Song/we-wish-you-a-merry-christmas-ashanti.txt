                        Bài hát: We Wish You A Merry Christmas - Ashanti

We wish you a Merry Christmas 
We wish you a Merry Christmas 
We wish you a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year. 
(Repeat - lặp lại) 
Good tidings we bring to you and your kin 
We wish you a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year. 

We all want some figgy pudding 
We all want some figgy pudding 
We all want some figgy pudding, so bring some right here. 

We won't go until we get some 
We won't go until we get some 
We won't go until we get some, so bring some right here. 

Good tidings we bring to you and your kin 
We wish you a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year. 

We wish you a Merry Christmas 
We wish you a Merry Christmas 
We wish you a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year.
