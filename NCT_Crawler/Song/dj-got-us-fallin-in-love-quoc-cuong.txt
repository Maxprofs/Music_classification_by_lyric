                        Bài hát: DJ Got Us Fallin In Love - Quốc Cường

Yeah man
So we back in the club
Get that bodies rockin from side to side (si-side to side)
Thank God the week is done,I feel like a zombi gone back to life (ba-back to life)
Hands-up,and suddenly we all got our hands-up

No control of my body
Ain't i seen you before?
I think I remember those
Eyes,eyes,eye s,eyes,e-e

Cuz baby tonight
The DJ got us falling in love again
Yeah baby tonight
The DJ got us falling in love again

So dance dance
Like its the last last night
Of your life life
Im'ma get you right
Cuz baby tonight
The DJ got us falling in love again

Keep downing drinks like this
Not tomorrow not just right
Now now now now n-now now
Gonna set the roof on fire,gonna burn this mother****
Down down down down d-down down
Hands up when the music drops
We both put our hands up

Put your hands up on my body
Swear i've seen you before
I think I remember those
Eyes,eyes,eye s,eyes,e-e

Cuz baby tonight
The DJ got us falling in love again
Yeah baby tonight
The DJ got us falling in love again

So dance dance
Like its the last last night
Of your life life
Im'ma get you right
Cuz baby tonight
The DJ got us falling in love again

In the cover of the music
Get naked baby
I'm sorry chica
Better holla at Tyronne
Let him know how I jump through your foot loop scolla chica two can
We're from blocka blocka o polaca
Where the boys loose like a wacka flaca
Ooh no man,its global was'up Colale flaca
I wanna be your giant no not your dada

Yo soy el cubanito que esta tostaito
Yo freco,no Ok

Cuz baby tonight
The DJ got us falling in love again
Yeah baby tonight
The DJ got us falling in love again
So dance dance
Like its the last last night
Of your life life
Im'ma get you right
Cuz baby tonight
The DJ got us falling in love again
Yeah baby tonight
The DJ got us falling in love again
So dance dance
Like its the last last night
Of your life life
Im'ma get you right
Cuz baby tonight
The DJ got us falling in love again.
