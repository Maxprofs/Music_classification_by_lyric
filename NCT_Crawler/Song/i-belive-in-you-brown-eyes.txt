                        Bài hát: I belive in you - Brown Eyes

Since it's the first time
It gets better after a few days
Just by thinking of you, a year already has passed
Every anniversary with you, sadness comes to me
As I first confessed my love, fluttered shyness
And the day we first met passed
On your birthday, I light the tear's birthday candle
And congratulate you

I believe in you, I believe in your mind
Even though a year already has passed
Even after that one year, I'm waiting for you

I didn't tell you
That I missed you and wanted you to come back
Because of the warm eye expression of the guy
And your face that is lighten more

Than the ring on your left hand

I believe in you, I believe in your mind
Because I know you started over
Now that you can make memories without me

The memories I remember
Are always past smiles, stories, and hopes
I also made one other memory
In my waiting and tears is you

I believe in you, I believe in your mind
Because I know you started over
Now that you can make memories without me
I believe in you, I believe in your mind
Even though a year already has passed
Even after that one year, I'm waiting for you
                        
                    |
