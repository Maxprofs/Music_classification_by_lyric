                        Days go by my window
 World slows down as it goes
 Goodbye to last night
 Lost love out of sight
 Can’t you help me see? (They won’t get right)

 [Chorus:]
 Loving every minute cause you make me feel so alive
 Alive
 Loving every minute cause you make me feel so alive
 Alive, alive, alive

 Waking in the snow
 Tracing steps with you
 Swimming through the snow
 Wrapped in, proud we’ll go
 Can’t you help me see? (They won’t get right)

 [Chorus:]
 Loving every minute cause you make me feel so alive, alive
 Loving every minute cause you make me feel so alive, alive
 Alive, alive, alive

 Can you describe to me
 All the world that you see
 All you need is so much, I’m just waiting on

 Freedom is within you
 Giving makes us feel good
 Hello to our people
 Say hello to the future
 Freedom is within you
 And giving makes us feel good
 Hello to our people
 Say hello to the future

 [Chorus:]
 Loving every minute cause you make me feel so alive, alive
 Loving every minute cause you make me feel so alive, alive
 Alive, alive, alive
 Loving every minute cause you make me feel so alive
 Alive
 Loving every minute cause you make me feel so alive
 Alive, alive, alive
                        
                    |
