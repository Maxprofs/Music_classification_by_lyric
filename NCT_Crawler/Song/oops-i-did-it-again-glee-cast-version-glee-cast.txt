[Rachel:]
I think I did it again, 
I made you believe,
We're more than just friends
Oh baby,
It might seem like a crush,
But it doesn't mean,
That I'm serious

Cause to lose,
All my senses,
That is just so typically me
Oh baby,baby

Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah 
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah

You see,
My problem is this,
I'm dreamin' away,
Wishing that heroes,
They truly exist,
I cry watching the days,
Can't you see I'm a fool,
In so many ways

Oops, I did it again,
I played with your heart,
Got lost in the game,
Oh baby, baby
Oops, you think I'm in love,
That I'm sent from above,
I'm not that innocent

Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah 
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah

Oops I,
Did it again to your heart,
Got lost,
In this game 
Oh baby,
Oops you,
Think that I'm sent from above
I'm not that innocent!

Oops, I did it again,
I played with your heart,
Got lost in the game,
Oh baby, baby
Oops, you think I'm in love,
That I'm sent from above,
I'm not that innocent

Oops, I did it again,
I played with your heart,
Got lost in the game,
Oh baby, baby
Oops, you think I'm in love,
That I'm sent from above,
I'm not that innocent
