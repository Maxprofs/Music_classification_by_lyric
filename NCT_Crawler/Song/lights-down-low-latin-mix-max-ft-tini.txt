                        Bài hát: Lights Down Low - Max Schneider

Heaven only knows where you been. But I don't really need to know. I know where you're gonna go
On my heart where
You're resting your head
And you just look so beautiful
Just like you were an Angel

Can I stop the flow of time
Can I swim in your divine
Cos I don't I think I'd ever
Leave this place

Ooh oh
Turn the lights, turn the lights
Down low
Yeah
Now I'm feeling you, breathing slow
Cause baby we're just reckless kids
Trying to find an island in the flood
And Ooh oh
Just turn the lights, turn the lights
Down low oh.

Ooh oh
Turn the lights, turn the lights
Down low
Ooh oh
Turn the lights, turn the lights
Down low

Under heavy skies in the rain
You're dancing
In your bare feet
Just like we're in a movie
Grab my hand and we're chasing the train
I catch you looking back at me. Running through a cloud of steam.

Ooh oh
Turn the lights, turn the lights
Down low
Yeah
Now I'm feeling you, breathing slow
Cause baby
We're just reckless kids trying to find an island in the flood
Ooh oh
Turn the lights, turn the lights
Down low

And I would give you everything baby. Can you feel this energy take it. You can have the best me baby. And I would give you anything. Can you feel this energy take it. You can have the best of me baby.

Ooh oh
Turn the lights, turn the lights
Down low
Yeah
Now I'm feeling you, breathing slow
Cause baby we're just reckless kids
Trying to find an island in the flood
And Ooh oh
Just turn the lights, turn the lights
Down low oh.

Ooh oh
Turn the lights, turn the lights
Down low
Ooh oh
Turn the lights, turn the lights
Down low
