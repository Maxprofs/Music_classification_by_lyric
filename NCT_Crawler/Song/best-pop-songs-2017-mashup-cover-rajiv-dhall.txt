                        Bài hát: Best Pop Songs 2017 Mashup Cover - Rajiv Dhall

(I'm in love with the shape of you)
(I don't know if you could take it)
Havana, ooh na-na (ay)
Half of my heart is in Havana, ooh-na-na (ay, ay)
You just want attention, you don't want my heart
Maybe you just hate the thought of me with someone new
Despacito 
Quiero respirar tu cuello despacito 

Deja que te diga cosas al oído 
Para que te acuerdes si no estás conmigo
(I don't need nothin' else)
You know, I love it, when the music's loud
But c'mon, strip that down for me, baby
Now there's a lot of people in the crowd

But only you can dance with me
I like me better when I'm with you
(Promise me no promises)
I like me better when I'm with you
(I like me)
Body like a back road, drivin' with my eyes closed
I know every curve like the back of my hand
(I'm way too good at goodbyes)

I met you in the dark, you lit me up
You made me feel as though I was enough
I got issues
(I'm the one)
You got 'em too
(Yeah, I'm the one)
So give 'em all to me and I'll give mine to you
(Comes to you)

All you have to do is stay a minute
Just take your time
The clock is ticking, so stay
(I got new rules, I count)
Not tryna be indie
Not tryna be cool
Just tryna be in this
Tell me how you choose

Baby, I'm dancing in the dark with you between my arms
(We were staying in Paris)
I've been fuckin' hoes and poppin' pillies
Man, I feel just like a rockstar (star, ayy, ayy)
All my brothers got that gas
And they always be smokin' like a Rasta (-sta)
Oh, I’ve been shaking 
I love you when you go crazy 

You take all my inhibitions 
Baby, there’s nothing holding me back 
Daylight
I wake up feeling like you won't play right
I used to know
I don't wanna know, know, know, know 
Who's taking you home, home, home, home 
I'm loving you so, so, so, so 
The way I used to love you, no 
I don't wanna know

Slow hands
Like sweat dripping down our dirty laundry
No, no chance
That I'm leaving here without you
Baby, I'm sorry 
I'm not sorry
                        
                    |
