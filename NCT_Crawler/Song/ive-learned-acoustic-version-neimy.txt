                        Bài hát: I've Learned (Acoustic Version) - NEIMY

Even though the hardest 
Wind blows in my way
I am steady as a tree 
Cause I have found something 
I can rely on
I guess I found myself some peace 

It's like a blind man learning to see
Or a bird flying when it's free 
I've learned to love somebody
And even finer than my fantasy 
No clouds hanging over me 
I've learned to love somebody 
Somebody who’s holding me 

I've learned to love 
I've learned to love
Love 

And now I bring my joy wherever I go 
I want everyone to see 
I wanna paint the world in all of my colors
I guess I'm finally free yeah

It's like a blind man learning to see
Or a bird flying when it's free 
I've learned to love somebody
And even finer than my fantasy 
No clouds hanging over me 
I've learned to love somebody 
Somebody who’s holding me 

I've learned to love 
I've learned to love 
Love 

Somebody
I’ve learned to love 
Somebody 
I’ve learned to love 
Love 

Love Somebody 
I’ve learned to love 
I’ve learned to love 
Somebody 
I’ve learned to love
Love 
Somebody
Somebody who’s holding me
                        
                    |
