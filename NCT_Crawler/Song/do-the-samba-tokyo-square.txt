                        Bài hát: Do The Samba - Tokyo Square

I can feel your heart beat.
I can feel your body's heat
But in all inside me,
the flame of jealousy.
I saw you standing there,
with the medo(?) round the street,
moving alone with the light dancing
what are you doing all this morning
Oh it's just a sorry
let do the samba
do it right now
losing our control tonight
let do the samba
get some fun now
why there's a thing to care about
Oh Oh woo
no one are gonna help you
take you away from me
miss you much oh darling
I missing you much indeed
fire a light ...
I can lost control with me
maybe we don't meet for each other
how can I let you stay away like this
to me it's just a sorry
let do the samba
do it right now
losing our control tonight
let do the samba
get some fun now
what do you think about?
let do the samba
do it right now
losing our control tonight
let do the samba
get some fun now
what do you think about?
Oh Oh woo

One two three

let do the samba
do it right now
losing our control tonight
let do the samba
get some fun now
what do you think about?
....
