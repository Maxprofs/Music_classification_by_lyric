                        CHRISTINE:
In sleep he sang to me
In dreams he came
That voice which calls to me
And speaks my name

And do I dream again?
For now I find
The Phantom of the Opera is there
Inside my mind

PHANTOM:
Sing once again with me
Our strange duet
My power over you
Grows stronger yet

And though you turn from me
To glance behind
The Phantom of the Opera is there
Inside your mind

CHRISTINE:
All those who've seen your face
Draw back in fear
I am the mask you wear

PHANTOM:
It's me they hear

BOTH:
Your/my spirit and my/your voice
In one combined
The Phantom of the Opera is there
Inside my/your mind

VOICES:
He's there, the Phantom of the Opera
Beware, the Phantom of the Opera...

PHANTOM:
In all your fantasies
You always knew
That man and mystery

CHRISTINE:
Were both in you

BOTH:
And in this labyrinth
Where night is blind
The Phantom of the Opera is there
Inside my/your mind

PHANTOM:
Sing, my angel of music!

CHRISTINE:
He's there, the Phantom of the Opera
Ah!

PHANTOM:
Sing, my angel, sing!

CHRISTINE:
Ah!

PHANTOM:
Sing for me!

CHRISTINE:
Ah!

PHANTOM:
Sing, my angel of music!

CHRISTINE:
Ah!
                        
                    |
