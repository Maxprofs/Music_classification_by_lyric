                        Bài hát: Rockabye (Praia Del Sol & Renco Remix) - Clean Bandit

[Verse 1: Anne-Marie + (Sean Paul)] 
She works the nights, by the water 
She's gonna stress, so far away 
From her father's daughter 
She just wants a life for her baby 
All on her own, no one will come 
She's got to save him (Daily struggle) 
[Pre-Chorus 1: Anne-Marie + (Sean Paul)] 
She tells him, "Oh, love, no one's ever gonna hurt you, love 
I'm gonna give you all of my love 
Nobody matters like you" 
(Stay out there, stay out there) 
She tells him, "Your life ain't gonna be nothing like my life 
You're gonna grow and have a good life 
I'm gonna do what I've got to do" 
(Stay out there, stay out there) 

[Chorus: Anne-Marie + (Sean Paul)] 
So, Rockabye baby, Rockabye 
I'm gonna rock you 
Rockabye baby, don't you cry 
Somebody's got you 
Rockabye baby, Rockabye 
I'm gonna rock you 
Rockabye baby, don't you cry 
Rockabye, no 

[Drop: Sean Paul + (Anne-Marie)] 
Rockabye-rocka-rocka-rocka-bye 
(Rockabye, yeah oh oh) 
Rockabye-rocka-rocka-rocka-bye 

[Verse 2: Sean Paul + (Anne-Marie)] 
Single mama you doing out there 
Facing the hard life, without no fear (Yeah) 
Just so you know that you really care 
Cause any obstacle come you’re well prepared (Oh no) 
And no mama, you never shed tear 
Cause you have to shed things year after year 
And you give the youth love beyond compare (Yeah) 
You find his school fee and the bus fare (Yeah) 
Mmm Marie, the paps' disappear 
In the round back can’t find him nowhere 
Steadily you work flow, everything you know 
You know say you nuh stop the time fi a jear 

[Bridge: Anne-Marie] 
Now she got a six-year-old 
Trying to keep him warm 
Trying to keep out the cold 
When he looks in her eyes 
He don't know he is safe 

[Pre-Chorus 2: Anne-Marie] 
When she says "oh, love, no one's ever gonna hurt you, love 
I'm gonna give you all of my love 
Nobody matters like you" 

[Chorus: Anne-Marie + (Sean Paul)] 
So, Rockabye baby, Rockabye 
I'm gonna rock you 
Rockabye baby, don't you cry 
Somebody's got you 
Rockabye baby, Rockabye 
I'm gonna rock you 
Rockabye baby, don't you cry 
(Oh-badda-bang-bang-bang, alright then) 
Rockabye, no 

[Drop: Sean Paul + (Anne-Marie)] 
Rockabye-rocka-rocka-rocka-bye 
(Rockabye, yeah oh oh) 
Rockabye-rocka-rocka-rocka-bye 

[Drop 2: Sean Paul] 
Rockabye, don't bother cry 
Lift up your head, lift it up to the sky 
Rockabye, don't bother cry 
Angels surround you, just dry your eye 

[Bridge: Anne-Marie] 
Now she got a six-year-old 
Trying to keep him warm 
Trying to keep out the cold 
When he looks in her eyes 
He don't know he is safe when she says 

[Pre-Chorus 1: Anne-Marie + (Sean Paul)] 
She tells him, "Oh, love, no one's ever gonna hurt you, love 
I'm gonna give you all of my love 
Nobody matters like you" 
(Stay out there, stay out there) 
She tells him, "Your life ain't gonna be nothing like my life (stay) 
You're gonna grow and have a good life 
I'm gonna do what I've got to do" 
(Stay out there, stay out there) 

[Chorus: Anne-Marie + (Sean Paul)] 
So, Rockabye baby, Rockabye 
(Rockabye-rocka-rocka-rocka-bye) 
I'm gonna rock you 
Rockabye baby, don't you cry 
(Rockabye-rocka-rocka-rocka-bye) 
Somebody's got you 
Rockabye baby, Rockabye 
(Rockabye-rocka-rocka-rocka-bye) 
I'm gonna rock you 
Rockabye baby, don't you cry 
(Oh-badda-bang-bang-bang, alright then)

[Drop 2: Sean Paul + (Anne-Marie)]

Lift up your head, lift it up to the sky (Rockabye) 
Rockabye, don't bother cry (Yeah) 
Angels surround you, just dry your eye (Yeah) 

[Drop 2: Sean Paul + (Anne-Marie)] 
Rockabye, don't bother cry (No) 
Lift up your head, lift it up to the sky (Oh) 
Rockabye, don't bother cry 
Angels surround you, just dry your eye
