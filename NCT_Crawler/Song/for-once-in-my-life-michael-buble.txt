Michael Buble - For Once In My Life
Narcissus

For once in my life
I got someone who needs me
Someone I've needed so long
For once, unafraid,
I can go where life leads me
somehow I know I'll be strong

For once I can touch
what my heart used to dream of
Long before I knew
Someone warm like you
Would make my dreams come true

For once in my life
I won't let sorrow hurt me
Not like it hurt me before
For once, I have someone
I know won't desert me
I'm not alone anymore

For once, I can say,
this is mine, you can't take it
As long as I know I have love,
I can make it
For once in my life,
I got someone who needs me

For once, I can say,
this is mine, you can't take it
As long as I know I have love,
I can make it
For once in my life,
I got someone who needs me
                        
                    |
