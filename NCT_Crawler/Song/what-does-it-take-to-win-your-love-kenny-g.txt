Dave Days - What Does It Take

I woke up
In the middle of the night
Out of luck
With this girl on my mind
She got away now
Im trying to explain how
I fell inlove
Thats what I like to call it
But not enough
It's like I never saw it
Drifting away I am
Finding words to say
But it all goes
Whoa Whoa
But it all goes
Whoa Whoa
What does it take to get you
If I never met you
I wouldnt have ran
Across the country like
Im out of my mind
What does it take to hold you
(Ah Ohh aah Ohhhhh)
When im here without you
(Ah Ohh aah Ohhhhh)
I dont know where to start
I gotta find you and your heart

Before it falls apart

I stayed up
In the dead of the night
I made plans
If they turn out right
You'll close your eyes and
Think about the times when
Think about it
We fell in love
But didnt try to say it
Knew what it was
The moment that we played it
We all lose sometimes
I cant get her off my mind
What does it take
Im Finding words to say
But it all goes
What does it take
What does it take
What does it take to get you
If I never met you
I wouldnt have ran
Across the country like
Im out of my mind
What does it take to hold you
(Ah Ohh aah Ohhhhh)
When im here without you
(Ah Ohh aah Ohhhhh)
I dont know where to start
I gotta find you and your heart

Before it falls apart
What does it take to make it real
The world still spinds and
Im still feeling
Your hand right next to mine
I play it back thousand times
I wish I took a photograph
For every moment that we laughed
I'm hung up and cant relax
Because shes so far way
What does it take to get you

What does it take to get you

What does it take to get you

If I never met you
I wouldnt have ran
Across the country like
Im out of my mind
What does it take to hold you
(Ah Ohh aah Ohhhhh)
When im here without you
(Ah Ohh aah Ohhhhh)
I dont know where to start
I gotta find you and your heart
Before it falls apart
What does it take
Im finding words to say
Before it falls apart
What does it take
Before it falls apart..
