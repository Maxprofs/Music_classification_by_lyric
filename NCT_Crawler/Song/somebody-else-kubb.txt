                        I don't want somebody else
 And I don't need anybody else
 You're gonna see that for yourself
 And you're gonna feel it in your head

 Chorus
 Coz I don't want somebody else
 Everytime you leave me alone girl
 You know you put me out in the cold
 But this time I'm not gonna break down and cry
 I'd rather die

 No more pride taking us down
 And no more time working it out
 I turned all the lights off in this house
 And I told all you're ghosts to get out

 Chorus
                        
                    |
