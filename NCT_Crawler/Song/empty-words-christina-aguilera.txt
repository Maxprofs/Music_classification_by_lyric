Ohh uuh
ohoh yeah

The funny thing about hurt people
Is they tend to hurt people
The funny thing about lies is
They're only lies
The funny thing about hearts is
They tend to break easy
The funny thing about healing is
Im alright

Your voice is like a knife
It used to make me cry
You tried to cut my pride
Not this time

So go ahead and say the things you got to say
You know you're only throwing empty words my way
Cause you won't break me you won't break me
You can't take me down
No

The funny thing about listening is
I don't have to hear you and the
Funny thing about talking is your words are tired
Now I've come to realise that
Life can be cruel but
The only approval that i need is mine

Your voice is like a knife
It used to make me cry
You tried to cut my pride
Not this time

So go ahead and say the things you got to say
You know you're only throwing empty words my way
Cause you won't break me you won't break me
You can't take me down
No 

So go ahead and say the things you got to say
It's only empty words a million miles away
Cause you won't break me you won't break me
You can't take me down
No 

The hardest part of this
Cannot be heard or seen
This journey starts when I begin loving me

So go ahead and say the things you got to say
You know you're only throwing empty words my way
Cause you won't break me you won't break me
You can't take me down
No 

So go ahead and say the things you got to say
It's only empty words a million miles away
Cause you won't break me you won't break me
You can't take me down
No 

So go ahead and say the things you got to say
You know you're only throwing empty words my way
