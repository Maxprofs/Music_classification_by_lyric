[00:-4.00]Drake - Find Your Love
[00:-1.00]
I'm more than just an option (Hey hey hey)
Refuse to be forgotten (Hey hey hey)
I took a chance with my heart (Hey hey hey)
And I feel it takin' over
I better find your lovin'
I better find your heart
I bet if I give all my love
Then nothin's gonna tear us apart
I'm more than just a number (Hey hey hey)
I doubt you'll find another (Hey hey hey)
So every single summer (Hey hey hey)
I'll be the one that you remember
And I better find your lovin'
It's more than just a mission (Hey hey hey)
You hear but you don't listen (Hey hey hey)
You better pay attention (Hey hey hey)
And get what you been missin'
Too many times, I've been wrong
I guess being right takes too long
I'm done waitin', there's nothin' left to do
But give all I have to you
