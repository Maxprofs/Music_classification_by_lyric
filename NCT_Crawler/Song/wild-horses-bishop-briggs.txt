                        Bài hát: Wild Horses - Bishop

You hold me down in the best way
No quarter from these chains that I've
Slept on my heart for a feeling
Why can't I live my demons out?

Keep screaming into the pillow
'Cause your touch still gets me stupid hot
Oh glory, I'm a believer
Oh glory, I'm a troubler

Wild horses, wild horses
Wild horses run faster, run faster
Run faster
Wild horses run faster, run faster
Run faster

You call my truth in the worst way,
Through the dirty lands of a broken smile
I swear I'm not a pretender,
Sometimes it's love who's the baby's cry

So, I keep on landing the devil
And you keep on saying it's alright
Oh glory, I'm a believer
Oh Lord, I'm holding tight, but

Wild horses, wild horses
Wild horses run faster, run faster
Run faster
Wild horses run faster, run faster
Run faster

So, I keep on landing the devil
And you'll keep on saying it's alright
Oh glory, I'm a believer
Oh Lord, I'm holding tight, but

Wild horses, wild horses
Wild horses run faster, run faster
Run faster
Wild horses run faster, run faster
Run faster
Wild horses run faster, run faster
Run faster
