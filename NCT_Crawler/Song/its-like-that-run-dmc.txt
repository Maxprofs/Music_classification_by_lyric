                        Unemployment at a record high
 People coming, people going, people born to die
 Don't ask me because I don't know why
 But it's like that and that's the way it is People in the world try to make ends meet
 You try to ride car, train, bus or feet
 I said, "You got to work hard to want to compete
 It's like that and that's the way it is, huh" Money is the key to end all your woes
 Your ups, your downs, your highs and your lows
 Won't you tell me last time that love bought you clothes?
 It's like that and that's the way it is Bills flies higher every day
 We receive much lower pay
 I'd rather stay young, go out and play
 It's like that and that's the way it is, huh War's going on across the sea
 Street soldiers killing the elderly
 What ever happened to unity?
 It's like that and that's the way it is Disillusion is the word
 That's used by me when I'm not heard
 I just go through life with my glasses blurred
 It's like that and that's the way it is, huh You can see a lot in this life span
 Like a bum eating out of a garbage can
 You notice one time he was your man
 It's like that and that's the way it is You should've gone to school, you could've learned a trade
 But you laid in the bed where the bums have laid
 Now all the time you're crying that you're underpaid
 It's like that and that's the way it is, huh One thing I know is that life is short
 So listen up homeboy, give this a thought
 The next time someone's teaching why don't you get taught?
 It's like that and that's the way it is If you really think about it times aren't that bad
 The one that stretches for success will make you glad
 Stop playing, start praying, you won't be sad
 It's like that and that's the way it is, huh When you feel you fail, sometimes it hurts
 For a meaning in life is why you search
 Take the boys on the train, drive to school on the church
 It's like that and that's the way it is Here's another point in life, you should not miss
 Do not be a fool who's prejudice
 Because we're all written down on the same list
 It's like that and that's the way it is, huh You know it's like that and that's the way it is
 Because it's like that and that's the way it is
 You know it's like that and that's the way it is
 Because it's like that and that's the way it is You know it's like that and that's the way it is
 Because it's like that and that's the way it is
 You know it's like that and that's the way it is
 Because it's like that and that's the way it is
