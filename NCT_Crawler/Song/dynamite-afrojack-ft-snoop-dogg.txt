Party people, your dreams have now been fulfilled

It’s time to get real!
It’s a party I’ve been hearing that you don’t know
And if you didn’t come to party, then you gotta go
Hands up in the sky, wave ‘em round from side to side
Got you feeling? how you feeling?
How you feeling?
DYNAMITE!
H ands up in the sky, wave ‘em round from side to side
Got you feeling? how you feeling?
How you feeling?
DYNAMITE!

[Snoop Dogg:]
Ladies, what them ladies say? Hey!
Ladies, what them ladies say? Hey!

What my homies say, homie say?

Gangsta bored, gangsta say
Yeah Dogg, we got your back
We want it like we own it, yeah
We beat it till we beat it, yeah
And only you can give it to us cause you know
We need it, yeah
Let the music play, I’m gon’ say what I’m gon’ say
Stack that stack, blue back
Afrojack that’s my DJ!
So, we gon’ continue to do what we’ve done
All around the world, for real my name
***ed it up!

It’s a party I’ve been hearing that you don’t know
And if you didn’t come to party, then you gotta go
Hands up in the sky, wave ‘em round from side to side
Got you feeling? how you feeling?
How you feeling?
DYNAMITE!
H ands up in the sky, wave ‘em round from side to side
Got you feeling? how you feeling?
How you feeling?
DYNAMITE!

Pour some other ***, all them bitches lovin’ it, lovin’ it
We covered it
I never give up my double name
But I’m shove it, I’m poppin’ it
With my Locky approach, you wanna be on my team
Bitch I’m the coach
Let’s go straight to the locker room
Get dressed and hit the grass,
Takin’ naked that cash
Break it, shakin’ that ass
For them players, say your prayer

Yeah, man!! ha haa
Yeah man!
Drinks in the air,
Smokin’ on a flat blunt
Turnt down for what?!
***, we turnt up
Drinks in the air,
Smokin’ on a flat blunt
Turnt down for what?!
***, we turnt up
Drinks in the air,
Smokin’ on a flat blunt
Turnt down for what?
***, we turnt up
Up! Up! Up! Up!
Drinks in the air,
Smokin’ on a flat blunt
Turnt down for what?
***, we turnt up
Drinks in the air,
Smokin’ on a flat blunt
Turnt down for what?

Drinks in the air,
Smokin’ on a flat blunt
Turnt down for what?

Drinks in the air,
Smokin’ on a flat blunt
Turnt down for what?
