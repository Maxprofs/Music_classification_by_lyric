                        Bài hát: Six Degrees Of Separation - The Script

You've read the books,
You've watched the shows,
What's the best way no one knows, yeah,
Meditate, get hypnotized.
Anything to take from your mind.
But it won't go, ohhhh ohhh
You're doing all these things out of desperation,
Ohhh ohhh,
You're going through six degrees of separation.

You hit the drink, you take a toke
Watch the past go up in smoke, yeah
Fake a smile, yeah, lie and say that,
You're better now than ever, and your life's okay
When it's not. No.
You're doing all these things out of desperation,
Ohhh ohhh,
You're going through six degrees of separation.

First, you think the worst is a broken heart
What's gonna kill you is the second part
And the third, Is when your world splits down the middle
And fourth, you're gonna think that you fixed yourself
Fifth, you see them out with someone else
And the sixth, is when you admit that you may have *** up a little

(Oh no there ain't no help, it's every man for himself)
(No no there ain't no help, it's every man for himself)

You tell your friends, yeah, strangers too,
Anyone who'll throw an arm around you, yeah
Tarot cards
Gems and stones,
Believing all that *** is gonna heal your soul.
Well it's not, no, wohhhh

You're only doing things out of desperation,
Ohhh no,
You're goin' through six degrees of separation.

First, you think the worst is a broken heart
What's gonna kill you is the second part
And the third, Is when your world splits down the middle
And fourth, you're gonna think that you fixed yourself
Fifth, you see them out with someone else
And the sixth, is when you admit that you may have *** up a little

No there's no starting over,
Without finding closure, you'd take them back,
No hesitation,
That's when you know you've reached the sixth degree of separation

Oh, no there's no starting over,
Without finding closure, you'd take them back,
No hesitation,
That's when you know you've reached the sixth degree of separation

First, you think the worst is a broken heart
What's gonna kill you is the second part
And the third, Is when your world splits down the middle
And fourth, you're gonna think that you fixed yourself
Fifth, you see them out with someone else
And the sixth, is when you admit that you may have *** up a little

No, no, there ain't no help
It's every man for himself
You're goin' through six degrees of separation

No, no, there ain't no help
It's every man for himself
You're goin' through six degrees of separation

No, no, there ain't no help
It's every man for himself
