                        Bài hát: Want To Want Me - J.Fla

It's so hard to sleep 
I got the sheets on the floor 
Listen to me 
And I can't take it no more 
It's a hundred degrees 
I got one foot out the door 
Where are my keys? 
'Cause I gotta leave, yeah 

In the back of the cab 
I tip the driver, head to town 
Give me the best 
I got your body on my mind 
I want it back 
Ooh, just the thought of you gets me so high, so high 

Boy, you don't want 
I want you to want me 
And if you want, hey boy, you got me 
There's nothing I know I wouldn't do, I wouldn't do 
Just to get up next you 

Boy, you don't want 
I want you to want me 
And if you want, hey boy, you got me 
There's nothing I know I wouldn't do, I wouldn't do 
Just to get up next you 
Just to get up next you 

You open the door 
There ain't nothing but a smile drawn to the floor 
And you whisper in my ear, baby I'm yours 
Ooh, just the thought of you gets me so high, so high 

Boy, you don't want 
I want you to want me 
And if you want, hey boy, you got me 
There's nothing I know I wouldn't do, I wouldn't do 
Just to get up next you 

Boy, you don't want 
I want you to want me 
And if you want, hey boy, you got me 
There's nothing I know I wouldn't do, I wouldn't do 
Just to get up next you 
Just to get up next you 

Just the thought of you gets me so high, so high 
Ooh, just the thought of you gets me so high, so high 

Boy, you don't want 
I want you to want me 
And if you want, hey boy, you got me 
There's nothing I know I wouldn't do, I wouldn't do 
Just to get up next you 

Boy, you don't want 
I want you to want me 
And if you want, hey boy, you got me 
There's nothing I know I wouldn't do, I wouldn't do 
Just to get up next you 
Just to get up next you
