                        I want your body 
Won’t live without it 
So turn up the party 
I’m feeling naughty 
Stay close to me, I’ll be all that you need 
Don’t deny what you want baby 
I want your body 
All I desire, you relight the fire 
Just come with me, come with me 

Just gonna let it go tonight, 
All I want is you, thousand shades of blue 
Dancing in your eyes 
I’m just gonna let it go tonight, 
I just wanna be, hold you close to me 
Dancing in your eyes 
I want your body 

It’s getting hotter, the beat is louder 
I know you want me, and I want your body 
Stay close to me, I’ll be all that you need 
Don’t deny what you want baby 
I want your body 
All I desire, you relight the fire 
Just come with me, come with me 

Just gonna let ig go tonight, 
All I want is you, thousand shades of blue 
Dancing in your eyes 
I’m just gonna let it go tonight, 
I just wanna be, hold you close to me 
Dancing in your eyes 
I want your body
