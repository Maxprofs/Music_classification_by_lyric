                        City lights shine on the harbour,
 night has fallen down,
 through the darkness and the shadow
 I will still go on.

Long, long journey through the darkness,
 long, long way to go;
 but what are miles across the ocean
 to the heart that's coming home?

Where the road runs through the valley,
 where the river flows,
 I will follow every highway to the place I know.

Long, long journey through the darkness,
 long, long way to go;
 but what are miles across the ocean
 to the heart that's coming home?

Long, long journey out of nowhere,
 long, long way to go;
 but what are sighs and what is sadness
 to the heart that's coming home?
                        
                    |
