                        (verse 1) 
I'm in a cube land 
I dig with cold hands 
I use these tools to try and climb out of this mess I've made 

My door is open 
Skeletons and zombies 
I am broken, as they walk all over me 
But if I keep on building walls, maybe they'll stay away 

(pre-chorus) 
Think fast, it's got to last if you're gonna make it through the rest of the day 
I'm trapped, I can't go back, I've made the choice to stay 

(chorus) 
And we'll fight... keep defending through the night 
(we'll fight the good fight) 
Live... we're all driven to survive 
(we'll fight the good fight) 
I'll keep going, just stay by my side. 

(verse 2) 
I'm in a cube land 
My castle's so grand 
And once I lay these tracks I'll finally make my escape 

I am no one 
I have no place, no one relates 
And there is no sun 
As the night covers this space 
But I beg you, please please don't let this life go to waste 

(repeat pre-chorus and chorus)
                        
                    |
