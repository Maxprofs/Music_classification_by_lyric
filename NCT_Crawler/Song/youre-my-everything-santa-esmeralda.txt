                        Bài hát: You'Re My Everything - Santa Esmeralda

You're my everything
The sun that shines above you
Makes the bluebirds sing
The stars that twinkle way up in the sky
Tell me I'm in love

When I kiss your lips
I feel the rolling thunder to my finger tips
And all the while my head is in a spin
Deep within, I'm in love

You're my everything
And nothing really matters but the love you bring
You're my everything
To see you in the morning with those big brown eyes
You're my everything
Forever and a day I'm need you close to me
You're my everything
You never have to worry, never fear, for I am near

For my everything
I live up on the land and see the sky above
I swim within her ocean sweet and warm
There's no storm, my love

You're my everything no nothing really matters
But the love you bring
You're my everything
To see you in the morning with those big brown eyes,
You're my everything
Forever and a day I'm need you close to near
You're my everything
You never have to worry, never fear, for I am near

When I hold you tight
There's nothing that can harm you in the lonely night
I'll come to you and keep you save and warm
Yet so strong, my love

When I kiss you lips
I feel the rolling thunder to my fingertips
And all the while my head is in a spin
Deep within
I'm in love
                        
                    |
