                        Bài hát: The Last Of The Real Ones - Fall Out Boy

I was just an only child of the universe
And then I found you
And then I found you
You are the sun and I am just the planets
Spinning around you
Spinning around you
You were too good to be true
Gold plated
But what's inside you
But what's inside you
I know this whole damn city thinks it needs you
But not as much as I do
Not as much as I do

Cause you're the last of a dying breed
Write our names in the wet concrete
I wonder if your therapist knows
Everything about me
I'm here in search of your glory
There's been a million before me
That ultra kind of love 
You never walk away from
You're just the last of the real ones

I am a collapsing star with tunnel Vision
But only for you
But only for you
My head is stripped just a screw that's been tightened too many times
When I think of you
When I think of you
I will shield you from the waves
If they find you
I will protect you
I will protect you
Just tell me tell me tell me I am the only one
Even if it's not true
Even if it's not true

I'm here at the beginning of the end
The end of infinity with you
I'm done with having dreams
The thing that I believe
You drain all the fear from me
                        
                    |
