So close, no matter how far
Couldn't be much more from the heart
Forever trusting who we are
'cuz nothing else matters

Never opened myself this way
Life is ours, we live it our way
All these words I just don't say
'cuz nothing else matters

Never cared for what they do
Never cared for what they know
But I know

So close, no matter how far
Couldn't be much more from the heart
Forever trusting who we are
'cuz nothing else matters

Never cared for what they do
Never cared for what they know
Never cared for what they do
But I know

Trust I seek and I find in you
Every day for us, something new
Open mind for a different view
'cuz nothing else matters

So close, no matter how far
Couldn't be much more from the heart
Forever trusting who we are
'cuz nothing else matters
'cuz nothing else matters
