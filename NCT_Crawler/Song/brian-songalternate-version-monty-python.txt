                        Brian. The babe they called 'Brian',
 He grew,... Grew, grew, and grew--
 Grew up to be-- grew up to be
 A boy called 'Brian'--
 A boy called 'Brian'.
 He had arms... And legs... And hands... And feet,
 This boy... Whose name was 'Brian',
 And he grew,... Grew, grew, and grew--
 Grew up to be--
 Yes, he grew up to be
 A teenager called 'Brian'--
 A teenager called 'Brian',
 And his face became spotty.
 Yes, his face became spotty,
 And his voice dropped down low
 And things started to grow
 On young Brian and show
 He was certainly no--
 No girl named 'Brian',
 Not a girl named 'Brian'.

 And he started to shave
 And have one off the wrist
 And want to see girls
 And go out and get pissed,
 A man called 'Brian'--
 This man called 'Brian'--
 The man they called 'Brian'--
 This man called 'Brian'!
