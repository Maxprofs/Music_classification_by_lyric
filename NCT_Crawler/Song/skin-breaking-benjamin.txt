                        Well, I know, you don't know the reason
 An' it's cold, a sign of the season
 'Cause you're old an' battered an' beaten
 And we'll grow, 'til we hit the ceiling, oh Yeah, we know we better
 Get away, send a letter
 Bombs away, covered in my skin
 I couldn't imagine anyone else
 Come up with a weekend
 I couldn't imagine, why you would save yourself? Well, it's gone and it's not returning
 And your clothes and pictures are burning
 'Cause you're old an' battered an' beaten
 And we'll grow, 'til we hit the ceiling, oh Yeah, we know we better
 Get away, send a letter
 Bombs away, covered in my skin
 I couldn't imagine anyone else
 Come up with a weekend
 I couldn't imagine, why you would save yourself?
 Eyaa Yeah, we know we better
 Get away, send a letter
 Bombs away, covered in my skin
 I couldn't imagine anyone else
 Come up with a weekend
 I couldn't imagine anyone else
 You're covered in my skin
 I couldn't imagine anyone else
 Come up with a weekend
 I couldn't imagine
 Why you would save yourself?
