                        Bài hát: Bad Husband - Eminem, X Ambassadors

[Verse 1: Eminem]
We never saw from each other's sides, or eye to eye
Just eye for eye, lie for lie, fight or flight
So much baggage, need a luggage rack
But we carry on with our public spats and our feuds
Oh, back in the news, love taps when I dissed you
Like it was fun, actually used to run
Back to the booth, jump back in the studio
Give you a tongue lashing then you
Laughed at a stomach tat with the tomb stone
It was funny, back in our youth
But then it wasn’t after we knew
That we were done and actually through (and actually through)
But if there's one fraction of truth
If it could be spun back I would do so many things different
'Cause it was such a dumbass excuse
You hit me once, and that I would use
To continue the pattern of abuse
Why did I punch back?
Girls, your dad is a scumbag
I’m confused because

[Chorus: X Ambassadors]
How come you can be a lord and a loser?
How come, how come, you can be a liar and a good father?
A good dad, but a bad husband
Why are you a good father
A great dad, but a bad husband?

[Verse 2: Eminem]
You were the beat I love, with a writer's block
Just a line that's hot, that I forgot
We laughed a little, cried a lot
I'll never forget when you came home and you held Hailie
Day before you went to jail and daily
How we would wait for that mail lady
Or by the phone, for mom to call
And I watch you pull yourself up
And we decided on giving it one more try despite it all
You're my lightning rod when my sky gets dark
I'm your shiny rocks in that tiny box
When we tied the knot, when we broke the knot
Every line we crossed, we were supposed to not
Every time we fought, the insults they got
Thrown too far
Words that we said that we didn't mean
The words that we meant that we didn't say
The ones that we thought that should’ve said
Letters written that we coulda read
Which maybe woulda lead to some good instead
And had this put to bed
But I’d be lying still if I wasn't sitting here asking myself

[Chorus: X Ambassadors, Hailie Jade, Eminem]
How come you can be a lord and a loser?
How come, how come, you can be a liar and a good father?
A good dad, but a bad husband
Why are you a good father?
A great dad, but a bad husband
(dad) (you said)
Forever be a hero in my eyes (I reply)
But there’s always another side to a good father
A great dad, but a bad husband

[Verse 3: Eminem]
We brought out the worst in each other
Someone had to make the sparring end
'Cause I loved you but I hated that me
And I don't wanna see that side again
But I'm sorry Kim
More than you could ever comprehend
Leaving you was *** harder than
Sawing off a *** body limb
Once upon a time where all we had
Maybe that was what drew us to each other
It was true love *** that we never knew was possible
We might have loved each other too much
And maybe that’s what made us do what we did to each other
All the screw-ups
'Cause you always thought that you was more in love with me
And I was thinking I was more in love than you was
For all the times that we thought it worked
'Til we saw how wrong we were
When the dust settles now and all the dirt
And if I touch the rawest nerve all I want is for us not to hurt
And it's been an exhaustive search to find the words
But I just heard "Mockingbird"
And got the urge to jot some verses and thoughts
The purpose was not to stir up open wounds
I've caused got a few, and so have you
Or argue whose fault it was, partly yours, partly mine
But really no one's, this is so tough
I'm getting choked up
Oh *** it, we both suck
We broke up, got back together
We both thought we had forever
Not bad people, just bad together
We were so nuts, backstabbed each other
Another blow struck, but there's no ducking this blow
'Cause it's over, and it's closure
But, I'm not so sure how to close this, I just don't know
How some people can be so good
At one thing and so ***ed at a whole 'nother
***, it's no wonder

[Chorus: X Ambassadors, Hailie Jade, Eminem]
How come you can be a lord and a loser?
How come, how come, you can be a liar and a good father?
A good dad, but a bad husband
Why are you a good father?
A great dad, but a bad husband
(dad) (you said)
Forever be a hero in my eyes (I reply)
But there's always another side to a good father
A great dad, but a bad husband
