                        We sailed out in the morning
 As the winter turns to spring
 Undestined and unknowing
 Of what tomorrow brings
 Towards the blue horizon
 Leaving all we have behind
 Our yearning hearts will guide us to find A dream we carry with us
 And the hopes that we hold
 As we rise from the ash into gold
 We reach for the impossible
 As unreal it may seem
 Still we sail 'cross the ocean
 And follow the dream The moon and stars above us
 Will lead us to the shore
 My heart will be my compass
 And you will be my north
 We forecast stormy weather
 And pro-and-con our moves
 But what have we achieved ... A dream we carry with us
 And the hopes that we hold
 As we rise from the ash into gold
 We reach for the impossible
 As unreal it may seem
 We will sail 'cross the ocean
 And capture the dream One day arriving
 Behind the far blue
 Where you'll find me waiting
 And I will find you too A dream we carry with us
 And the hopes that we hold
 As we rise from the ash into gold
 We reach for the impossible
 As unreal it may seem
 We will sail 'cross the ocean
 And become the dream
                        
                    |
