                        I'm over your lies
and I'm over your games
I'm over you asking me
when you know I'm not okay
You call me at night
and I pick up the phone
And though you've been telling me
I know you're not alone
Oh...

That's why
(your eyes)
I'm over it
(your smile)
I'm over it
(realize)
I'm over it
I'm over it
I'm over...

Wanting you,
to be wanting me
No that ain't no way to be
How I feel, read my lips
because I'm so over...
Moving on, it's my time
you never were a friend of mine
Hurt at first, a little bit
but now I'm so over
I'm so over it...

I'm over your hands
and I'm over your mouth
Trying to drag me down
and fill me with self-doubt
Oh...

That's why,
(your words)
I'm over it
(so sure)
I'm over it
(I'm not your girl)
I'm over it
I'm over it
I'm over...

Wanting you,
to be wanting me
No that ain't no way to be
How I feel, read my lips
because I'm so over...
Moving on, it's my time
you never were a friend of mine
Hurt at first, a little bit
but now I'm so over
I'm so over it...
I'm so over it...

Don't call
Don't come by
Ain't no use
Don't ask me why
You'll never change
There'll be no more crying in the rain

Wanting you
to be wanting me
No that ain't no way to be
How I feel, read my lips
because I'm so over...
Moving on, it's my time
you never were a friend of mine
Hurt at first, a little bit
but now I'm so over
I'm so over it...

I'm so over it....
I'm over it....

Wanting you
to be wanting me
No that ain't no way to be
How I feel, read my lips
because I'm so over...
Moving on, it's my time,
you never were a friend of mine
Hurt at first, a little bit
but now I'm so over
I'm so over it...
