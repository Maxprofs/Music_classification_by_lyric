                        Today I don't feel like doing anything
I just wanna lay in my bed
Don't feel like picking up my phone
So leave a message at the tone
'Cause today I swear I'm not doing anyhing

I'm gonna kick my feet up
Then stare at the fan
Turn the TV on, throw my hand down my pants
Nobody's gonna tell me I can't

I'll be lying on the couch,
just chillin' in my snuggie
Click to MTV, so they can teach me how to dougie
'Cause in my castle I'm the freaking man
Oh Oh

Yes I said it
I said it
I said it 'cause I can

Today I don’t feel like doing anything
I just wanna lay in my bed
Don’t feel like picking up my phone
So leave a message at the tone
'Cause today I swear I'm not doing anything
Nothing at all

Tomorrow I'll wake up do some P90X
Meet a really nice girl, have some really nice sex
She's gonna scream out: 'This is Great'
[Hear me out: this is great]
Yeah

I might mess around, get my college degree
I bet my old man will be so proud of me
But sorry paps, you'll just have to wait
Oh Oh

Yes I said it
I said it
I said it 'cause I can

Today I don’t feel like doing anything
I just wanna lay in my bed
Don’t feel like picking up my phone
So leave a message at the tone
'Cause today I swear I'm not doing anything

No I ain't gonna comb my hair
'Cause I ain't going anywhere
No no no no no no no no no-oh

I'll just strike in my birthday suite
And let everything hang loose
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah-eah

Oh
Today I don’t feel like doing anything
I just wanna lay in my bed
Don’t feel like picking up my phone
So leave a message at the tone
'Cause today I swear I'm not doing anything

Nothing at all
Nothing at all
Nothing at all
