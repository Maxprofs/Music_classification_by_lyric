                        Bài hát: Do You Wanna Come Over? - Britney Spears

(Uh-huh)
What?
Say you feel alone
That your day was the baddest
Tellin' me you can't sleep because of your mattress
Do you wanna come over? (Yeah)
Do you wanna come over? (Yeah)

Let me rub your back
You can set limitations
Honey if you want we can get out frustrations
Do you wanna come over? (Just let me know)
Do you wanna come over? (Yeah)

Cause nobody should be alone if they don't have to be
Nobody should be alone if they don't have to be
Nobody should be alone if they don't have to be
Should be alone if they don't have to be
So...

Whatever you want (Whatever you want)
Whatever you need (Whatever you need)
I'll do it (uh-huh)
I'll do it (uh-huh)
Whatever you want (Whatever you want)
Whatever you need (Whatever you need)
I'll do it (uh-huh)
I'll do it (uh-huh)
Do you wanna come over?

I could get into that kissin' and touchin'
Or we could be good and do next to nothin'
Do you wanna come over? (Yeah)
Do you wanna come over? (Yeah let me know)

Cause all I want is what you want
And all you want is me
Yeah, all you want is what I want
And all I want is you (yeah)

Cause nobody should be alone if they don't have to be
Nobody should be alone if they don't have to be
Nobody should be alone if they don't have to be
Should be alone if they don't have to be
So...

Whatever you want (Whatever you want)
Whatever you need (Whatever you need)
I'll do it (uh-huh)
I'll do it (uh-huh)
Whatever you want (Whatever you want)
Whatever you need (Whatever you need)
I'll do it (uh-huh)
I'll do it (uh-huh)
Do you wanna come over?

Cause all I want, Is what you I want
And all you want Is me
Yeah, all you want, Is what I want
And all I want Is you
Just come over

Whatever you want (Whatever you want)
Whatever you need (Whatever you need)
I'll do it (uh-huh)
I'll do it (uh-huh)
Whatever you want (Whatever you want)
Whatever you need (Whatever you need)
I'll do it (uh-huh)
I'll do it (uh-huh)
Do you wanna come over?

Whatever you want
Whatever you need
Do you wanna come over?
