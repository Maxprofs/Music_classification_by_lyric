                        Bài hát: The Last Goodbye - Atomic Kitten

Ain't no headlights on the road tonight
Everybody here is sleeping tight
Ain't nobody gonna find us here
We'll disappear
There's a dancer in the arms of love
And he's dancing on the sky above
And the truth is that we'll never know where love will flow

Aim high
Shoot low
(Gotta aim high, shoot low baby)

Ain't no headlights on the road tonight
Ain't nobody here to make it right
Cos we couldn't seem to find a way, for love to stay
If you had another night to give
I would have another night to live
But you're never gonna see me cry the last goodbye

(The last goodbye)

Is it cloudy where you are tonight?
Are the neon lights shining bright?
Are you looking for a place to stay to get away? (can't get away)
And the days are horses down the hill,
Running fast and there's no time to kill
And the truth is that we'll never know where love will flow

Aim high
Shoot low
(Gotta aim high, shoot low baby)

Ain't no headlights on the road tonight
Ain't nobody here to make it right
Cos we couldn't seem to find a way, for love to stay
If you had another night to give
I would have another night to live
But you're never gonna see me cry the last goodbye

(The last goodbye)

If I could do it over
I'd do it all again (again)
And if I got one more chance I wouldn't change a thing

Aim high
Shoot low
(Aim high, shoot low baby)

Ain't no headlights on the road tonight (tonight)
Ain't nobody here to make it right (make it right)
Cos we couldn't seem to find a way, for love to stay
If you had another night to give
I would have another night to live (night to live)
But you're never gonna see me cry the last goodbye

Ain't no headlights on the road tonight
Ain't nobody here to make it right (make it right)
Cos we couldn't seem to find a way, for love to stay (...stay)
If you had another night to give (night to give)
I would have another night to live (night to live)
But you're never gonna see me cry the last goodbye
                        
                    |
