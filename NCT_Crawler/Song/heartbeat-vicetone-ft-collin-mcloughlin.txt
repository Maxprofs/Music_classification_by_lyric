                        Bài hát: Heartbeat (Short Version) - Vicetone, Collin Mcloughlin

The sunlight begins to fade now
And I feel like I'm loosing time
But I don't know how I'm here
The sunlight is turned to gray
And I feel like I'm losing love again
And I don't know how I'm here

I could feel your heartbeat
I could feel the sun when you're looking down
I could feel your heartbeat
I could feel the sun when you're looking down
'Cause it's you who I'm loving
And it's you that I wanna breath
And it's you who I'm loving
And it's you that I want and need

And it's you that I want and need

And I know now we're getting older
The world we built
Is slipping through our fingers
We're running out of time
But you are the one I've chosen
And I won't lay still
Living left behind
Imprisoned by this love

I could feel your heartbeat
I could feel the sun when you're looking down
I could feel your heartbeat
I could feel the sun when you're looking down
'Cause it's you who I'm loving
And it's you that I wanna breath
And it's you who I'm loving
And it's you that I want and need

And it's you that I want and need
                        
                    |
