                        I've been really uninspired
 I think I need a miracle To believe in love
 I never really gave it all
 To believe in love
 I needed something more [Chorus]
 You're my lovely intermission
 You're the one that I've been waiting
 Waiting for you
 Waiting for you... You're my lovely intermission
 I can feel that something's missing
 Before I found you
 Before I found you Always being on my own
 (Want to be alone)
 (I just want to be alone)
 Never needed anyone
 (Needed anyone) To believe in love
 I used to think I had it all
 To believe in love
 I needed someone to adore [Chorus]
 You're my lovely intermission
 You're the one that I've been waiting
 Waiting for you
 Waiting for you... You're my lovely intermission
 I can feel that something's missing
 Before I found you
 Before I found you You're my lovely intermission (x8)
