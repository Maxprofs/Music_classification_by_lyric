                        Bài hát: Don’t Be A Fool - Shawn Mendes

You got my heart
But I can't let you keep it, babe
Coz I want be sure that I can stay
Don't waste your time
Trying to pull me in
Coz I'm just a mess
Don't wanna fix?

Promise me one thing that you won't forget?
But for now kiss me softly before I say
And don't be a fool
To wait on me darlin
I know that you don't wanna hear this
But I'm always on the move

And don't be a fool
And say that you love me
Coz you'll find a man
Who will stand by your side
And will be there for you
And just know that I do

Oh I really like you babe
I wanna be there for you
For the rest of your days
But I know your heart
If we keep on doing this
So I'm sorry to end this now
But I know it's for the best

And don't be a fool
To wait on me darlin
I know that you don't wanna hear this
But I'm always on the move

And don't be a fool
And say that you love me
Coz you'll find a man
Who will stand by your side

And will be there for you
I don't think you'll ever understand
I don't think you'll ever understand
I know that you don't wanna hear this but darling don't be a fool

And don't be a fool
And wait on me darling
I know that you don't wanna hear this
But I'm always on the move

Yeah
Just don't be a fool
And say that you love me
Coz you'll find a man
Who'll stand by your side
And be there for you

And don't be a fool
To wait on me darling
I know that you don't wanna hear this
But don't be a fool
