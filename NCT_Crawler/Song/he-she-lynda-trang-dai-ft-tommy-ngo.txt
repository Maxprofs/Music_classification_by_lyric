No problem, no problem
She can tease
She can please
She can play to my needs
She can soothe with her hands
And sugar, she can mm
Like my old girlfiiend and my new girlfriend
Like she, like her, so fine can they be
If the get their prada, so fine can they be
If they get their prada, and their jpg’s,
With their fendi and their gucci’s and their diamond rings, too much to their needs
Do you know what’s enough, when it’s enough?
That, that’s enough.

Fancy cars and disco bars he’ll buy them all he’ll spend it all
So why not all on me!
Stocks and bonds won’t do for long
He’ll lose it all on basketball
So spend it all on me.

Na na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na na.

It is mad, all these fads
And she has to have so she tells me honey
Baby buy fore me
She can shop but won’t drop
She can go far a while
Gotta quit, need to stop
Cause she ain’t gonna stop
It’s a crime, all this time to fulfill her needs
I ain’t dumb, just in deep
Cause my baby sure can please
Put a lock on the rocks and she will blow her top
Keep in mind ghe is fine, and she’ll rob you blind.

Custom suits, designer boots, he’ll charge it all, expense it all
So why not all on me
Dining fine with all that wine
He’ll lose his health with all his wealth
So spend it all on me.

Na na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na na.
