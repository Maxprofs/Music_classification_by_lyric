LYRICS:

The rain falls on my windows
And the coldness runs through my soul
And the rain falls, oh the rain falls
I don’t want to be alone

I wish that I could photoshop on
Our bad memories
Because the flashbacks, oh the flashbacks
Won’t leave me alone

If you come back to me
I’ll be all that you need
Baby, come back to me
Let me make up for what happened in the past

Chorus
(Come back)
Baby come back to me (Come back)
I’ll be everything you need (Come back)
Baby come back to me (Come back)
Boy you’re one in a million (Come back)
Baby come back to me (Come back)
I’ll be everything you need (Come back)
Baby come back to me (Come back)
You’re one in a million
(You’re one in a million)

Memories I have of Manhattan
She goes shopping for new clothes
And she buys this, and she buys that
Just leave her alone
I wish that he would listen to her
Side of the story
It isn’t that bad, it isn’t that bad
And she’s wiser for it now

I admit I cheated (admit I cheated )
Don’t know why I did it (why I did it)
But I do regret it (do regret it)
Nothing I can do or say can change the past

Chorus
(Come back)
Baby come back to me (Come back)
I’ll be everything you need (Come back)
Baby come back to me (Come back)
Boy you’re one in a million (Come back)
Baby come back to me (Come back)
I’ll be everything you need (Come back)
Baby come back to me (Come back)
You’re one in a million
(You’re one in a million)

Everything I ever did
Heaven knows I’m sorry but
I was too young to see
You were always there for me
And my curiosity
Got the better half of me
Baby take it easy on me
Anything from A to Z
Tell me what you want to be
I open my heart to be
You are more priority
Can’t you see you punished me
More than enough already
Baby take it easy on me

Baby take it easy on me
Baby come back to me
Baby come back to me

Chorus
(Come back)
Baby come back to me (Come back)
I’ll be everything you need (Come back)
Baby come back to me (Come back)
Boy you’re one in a million (Come back)
Baby come back to me (Come back)
I’ll be everything you need (Come back)
Baby come back to me (Come back)
You’re one in a million
(You’re one in a million)

(Come back)
Baby come back to me (Come back)
I’ll be everything you need (Come back)
Baby come back to me (Come back)
Boy you’re one in a million (Come back)
Baby come back to me (Come back)
I’ll be everything you need (Come back)
Baby come back to me (Come back)
You’re one in a million
(One in a million)
