First I'll acknowledge
Our trust has been broken
A successful recovery
I pray for us at night
Bless me with a second chance
Never thought I'd see your face again
Learned a lot through trial and error
I try to make it right, make it right

Make it right, make it right
It's time to do you right

I'm missing your good intentions
I'm missing you by my distance
Hope you did the same
I know that I caused a problem
I know that I left you livid, pushed you far away

Learned it, don't pay to lie
'Cause I don't wanna see you cry
Sayin' nothin' gets you nowhere fast
I'mma hold it back inside

Well now that I'm back around you
Nothing else really matters
Hope you feel the same

First I'll acknowledge
Our trust has been broken
A successful recovery
I pray for us at night
Bless me with a second chance
Never thought I'd see your face again
Learned a lot through trial and error
I try to make it right, make it right

Make it right, make it right
It's time to do you right

I'm going thorugh all the emotions
Tryin' to find a reason
Why we ended that way
Nothing in life is perfect
When you're changing like the seasons
That's what they used to say

If it's gonna sleep alone at night
I don't wanna close my eyes
Wanna give you all I have to give
I'm not holding back this time
Now that I'm back around you
Nothing around me matters
Hope you feel the same

First I'll acknowledge
Our trust has been broken
A successful recovery
I pray for us at night
Bless me with a second chance
Never thought I'd see your face again
Learned a lot through trial and error
I try to make it right, make it right

Make it right, make it right
It's time to do you right

Ooh know I'mma do you right
Ooh know I'mma do you right
I'mm do you right
Ooh know I'mma do you right
