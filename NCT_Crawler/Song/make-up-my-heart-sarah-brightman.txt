                        It's time I choose between the two of them
 I'd better make a start
 Someone help me make up my heart
 Tell me how to make up my heart You'd think two lovers would be twice the fun
 It's tearing me apart
 Someone help me make up my heart
 Tell me how to make up my heart One of them is strong, one of them is good
 Both could turn out wrong, so who gets the part?
 Make up my mind, make up my heart I don't want one to win and one to lose
 I'll tell them yes or no
 Choosing one means letting one go
 Can't face letting one of them go You'd think two lovers would be twice the fun
 It's tearing me apart
 Someone help me make up my heart One can make me laugh, one can make me sigh
 Why tear myself in half, so who gets the part?
 Make up my mind, make up my heart I don't want one to win and one to lose
 I'll tell them yes or no
 Choosing one means letting one go
 Can't face letting one of them go It's time I choose between the two of them
 I'd better make a start
 Someone help me make up my heart One can make me laugh, one can make me sigh
 Why tear myself in half, so who gets the part?
 Make up my mind, please make up my heart One can make me laugh, one can make me sigh
 Why tear myself in half, so who gets the part?
 Someone help me make up my heart
