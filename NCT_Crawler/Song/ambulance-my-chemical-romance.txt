                        You don't know a thing about this life
And we are up for everything it takes
to prove we're not the same as them
And we will wear our masks again out after dark
Cause we are up for everything it takes
and we are not the same

Cause we are not afraid
And we are not ashamed

And if you save my life
I'll be the one who drives you home tonight
And if I ever let you down
I'll be the one who drives you home tonight

Remember once, you walked this kind of life?
Quietly I'll sleep behind the wheel
And passing every face you see the first time
Singing every piece as you walk by
Proving that with all of my mistakes that we are not the same

Cause we are not the same
And we are all to blame....

And if you save my life
I'll be the one who drives you home tonight
And if they ever let you down
I'll be the one who drives you home tonight

You home tonight....

(They're tryin' to bring you down...) x8

You don't know a thing about this life

And you don't know a thing about this life

And you don't know a thing about this life

'Cause you don't know a thing about me,
you don't know a thing!

And if you save my life
I'll be the one who drives you home tonight
If they ever let you down
I'll be the one who drives you home tonight

You home tonight

Well you home to night....

('Cause they're tryin' to bring you down...) x3

'Cause they're tryin' to bring you down, bring you down, bring you down!
