                        You say, its not what you do
 It's what you're thinking of
 Well, I think it's just an excuse
 Its what you put across Cos I don't wanna be the one
 Only overjoyed
 Yeah, I don't wanna be the one
 Making all the noise
 Yeah, I don't wanna be the one So make sure you're thinking it through
 You've let me down again
 Offer me something
 I know you really meant Cos I don't wanna be the one
 Only overjoyed
 Yeah, I don't wanna be the one
 Making all the noise
 Yeah, I don't wanna be the one, hey What you gonna offer now? I don't wanna be the one
 Only overjoyed
 Yeah, I don't wanna be the one
 Making all the noise
 Yeah, I don't wanna be the one, hey What you gonna offer now?
 What you gonna offer now? This was not my idea
 Don't you keep
 What you gonna offer now?
 This was not my idea
 Don't you keep me waiting This was not my idea
 Don't you keep
 What you gonna offer now?
