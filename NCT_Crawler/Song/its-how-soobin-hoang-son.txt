                        Verse 1:
It's another song for you baby...
Though I'm tryin' to live it through the day
I've been missing you like crazy
Since the day you went away
I wish I could rewind it
To the very first time
Cuz I knew fo sho' you were tha finest
And I gotta make you mine...
Everynight in my dream I saw my wish came true
That you came back to me so I could say these words to you...

Hook:
It's how I feel about you girl
It's how I can be sure it's love 
It's how we touch,it's how we hug ...
It's how my time with you was not enough
It's how I kissed you for so long
It's how I missed you when you're gone
It's how I need you,wanna be with you
Cuz without you baby,everything seems wrong...

Verse 2:
I gave it to you,my heart and soul
So tell me why you still wanna go away
You came to my life when I was alone...
You left me here with all the pain
Tell me baby what I gotta do
How to love you again? 
I feel like I can't live without you
And do you feel the same?
Cuz everynight in my dream I saw my wish came true 
Why don't you come back to me so I could say these words to you

Bridge:
It's how I feel so guilty when I let you walk out that door
My heart is screaming loudly becuz I can't stand no more...
                        
                    |
