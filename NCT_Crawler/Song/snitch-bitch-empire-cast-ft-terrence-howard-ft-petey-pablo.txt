                        Bài hát: Snitch Bitch - Empire Cast, Terrence Howard, Petey Pablo

Streets are watching, eyes are on me
Closest to me done switched up on me
Days are longin', nights are lonely
It's betta than knowin' cause
Now I have know it bet'

Whooo, sittin' back, reminiscin'
Of how I used to get down and dirty with ya
I pull up on a hot block and come and get ya
With a pistol cocked to handle all issues
But never would I thought in a million wishes
After all we stood for you would start snitchin' 
I disregarded lessons that were shared with me
Cuz I was taught I'm not supposed to trust any
It's hard to see the frame when you're in the picture
But now the picture's faded, bitch - I'm done witcha
So gon' head, handle yo business
And here I am cause I come into business

Streets are watching, eyes are on me
Closest to me done switched up on me
Days are longin', nights are lonely
It's betta than knowin' cause
Now I have know it bet'
You ain't nothin' but a snitch, bitch
Snitchin' ass bitch
Snitch Bitch
Snitchin' ass bitch
And you know it
You know it
I know it
And you know I know it

Blood is thicker than water, the people say
I say people say whatever you pay 'em to say
And some will say whatever just to have something to say
You done said it wi'cha please get the hell on yo way
I'll never trust another single one of yo'
coz trust is just something you just don't get involved
Back stabbing bitch's get you knocked off
Classified information being passed off
They doin' deals, they at the round table
Pen and a pad, they making wild statements
Forget your allegations and yo investigations
I knew this day was coming, I've be patiently waitin'

Streets are watching, eyes on me
Closest to me done switched up on me
Days are longin', nights are lonely
It's betta than knowin' cause
Now I have know it bet'
You ain't nothin' but a snitch, bitch
Snitchin' ass bitch
Snitch Bitch
Snitchin' ass bitch
And you know it
You know it
I know it
And you know I know it

Temperatures in the 100's, hot as hell at this moment
Everything looks suspicious, coming around these corners
A Man want it, you can play around if you wanna
Ain't no safety, ain't no holster, and my hands is on it
now I ain't goin' as easy as you think Im'a go
Now Im'a lay low fo' a minute, then I'm coming for those
that decided to cross a road and roll with the wrong folks
like playing the grand piano but tapping the wrong notes
Clyde told me "Keep your eyes open for them jealous hittas"
Clyde told me " keep your head low coz they taking pictures"
My Partner Clyde told me "when they try to convince you they chillin wi'ch you pay very close attention
My Hitta, My Hitta, My Hitta

Snitch Bitch
Snitchin' ass bitch
Snitch Bitch
Snitchin' ass bitch
And you know it
You know it
I know it
And you know I know it.

You ain't nothing but a snitch bitch
Snitch Bitch
When they try to convince you they chillin wi'cha pay very close attention
My Hitta, My Hitta, My Hitta
