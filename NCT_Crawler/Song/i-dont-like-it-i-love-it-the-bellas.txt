                        Bài hát: I Don't Like It, I Love It - The Bellas

I don't like it, I love it, love it, love it, uh oh
So good it hurts
'Cause I don't want it, I gotta, gotta have it, uh oh
When I can't find the words I just go

I don't like it, no, I love it
I don't like it, no, I love it

[Verse 2]
All night, let me groove ya
Dance with me, turn down for who, girl?
Another runner help us step the moves up
Yeah, bet that round need a measure or ruler
Celebrate life and I'll pay for it
That Cavalli nice next to my Tom Ford
Yeah party all night, let's all aboard
Let's all aboard, all aboard

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I don't like it, I love it
And them other girls they can't touch it
Competition, that's a whole 'nother subject
I wanna walk it out in public
You a star baby, just know, let's go
To the mansion or the condo, let's go
Perfect time gotta let it flow, you know
I'm watching, I'm watching

[Chorus]
I don't like it, I love it, love it, love it, uh oh
So good it hurts
'Cause I don't want it, I gotta, gotta have it, uh oh
When I can't find the words I just go

I don't like it, no, I love it
I don't like it, no, I love it

[Bridge]
Meet me at the studio
Bangarang, just like Ruffio
Feel the base, let ya booty go
I wanna get inside it
Run away for a few days
Thinkin' 'bout love, baby touché
Tied up like a shoe lace
I don't like it, oh

[Outro]
Ooh, yeah yeah
What's up, yeah
Everybody go, come on, oh
Oh, I love it, yeah

Oh yeah
I don't like it, no, I love it
I don't like it but I love it

Yeah
I don't like it but I love it (I don't like it but I love it)
I don't like it but I love it, no
                        
                    |
