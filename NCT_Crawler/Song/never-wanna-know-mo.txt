                        Bài hát: Never Wanna Know - MO

All my dreams sold tonight
They’ll be safe as they fight
In the journey of the best

And I know I’ve caused you a lot of blues
Now the last one’s pain for you
But I can’t go without letting you know this

I begged your love somehow
Was too crazy to work out
I’m crazy about you
But I can’t, it just can’t do no bad

You’re only way into the moment
Then our lives are moving on
With no words, you only follow

(Pre-Chorus)
But I never wanna know hey hey
All your new girlfriends
Never wanna hear about it
Please dance away

(Chorus)
I never wanna know
Never wanna know
Never wanna know
Never wanna know

Withdrawn, my eyes will hide away
Think I found why I happened to stay
When why how should I do?
‘Cause I love you

Burn the moon, it blows again
And my life goes on my friend
Wisdom words, we work out

(Pre-Chorus)
But I never wanna know hey hey
All your new girlfriends
Never wanna hear about it
Please dance away

(Chorus)
I never wanna know
Never wanna know
Never wanna know
Never wanna know

(Bridge)
I have a soul, I just pray that you rob it
But that’s when you walked off, boy I want it to be fine
If your nights are so cold, how I need your human soul
I would never let you go
‘Cause I’ve been a little on you

Never wanna know
I never have to know know know
Please just dance away

(Chorus)
I never wanna know
Never wanna know
Never wanna know
Never wanna know

(Pre-Chorus)
But I never wanna know hey hey
All your new girlfriends
Never wanna hear about it
Please dance away
                        
                    |
