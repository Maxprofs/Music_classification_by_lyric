                        Yeah
 Like I dedicated this record
 To my mayne man Johny Cash
 A real american gangster
 I got my nephew whitey four on the guitar
 Young Trail on the drums
 Grand on lufrey
 Here we come
 Oh

 Jack me nimble, jack me quick
 Jack of the spoon on the candlestick
 Don't step tippin on the one trick only
 Yeah she kinda skinny but she gets my money

 [Ref:]
 Get my money
 Buy my medicine
 Buy my medicine
 Buy my medicine [x2]

 Yeah
 You know I've got a head at medicine
 That prescription medicine baby
 You know purple orange green

 Jack starts hanging round with the fiends
 Got strong out sold and count of beans
 Told young wife he got love your honey
 But you gotta hit the streets
 Go and get my money

 [Ref x2]

 Yeah

 The more dedicated the more medicated
 You feel me?

 Girl my love gonna last
 Just as long as my high

 And I'm high
 All day, everyday

 You can trust every word
 I'm gonna say will be a lie

 Haha
 Yeah, I lie sometimes

 What's the use of the truth
 If you can't get a lie sometimes baby
 Now, dig this

 Jack starts a track up and down a hill,
 Gotta walk and think "?an ace what he told to Jill?"
 Come rain, come shine, come snow of a sunny
 Get the *** out girl and get my money

 [Ref x2]

 Yeah
 They say you can't buy me love
 But you you damn show can buy me bud

 Girl my love gonna last
 Just as long as my high

 Oh, I'm so high right now
 How about you?

 You can trust every word
 I'm gonna tell you is a lie

 Liar, liar pants on fire

 Girl, I love you
 I love you though
