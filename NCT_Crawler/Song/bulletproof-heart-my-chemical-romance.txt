My Chemical Romance - Bulletproof Heart

Gravity
Don't mean too much to me
I'm who I've got to be
These pigs are after me, after you
Run away, like it was yesterday
And we could run away,
If we could run away,
Run away from here!

I got a bulletproof heart
You got a hollow point smile
Me and your runaway scarves,
Got a photograph dream on the getaway mile.

Let's blow a hole in this town
And too much talking with the laser blade,
Coming out of this place
In a bullet's embrace, then we'll do it again.

How can they say,
Jenny could you come back home?
'Cause everybody knows you don't
Ever wanna come back, let me be the one to save you.

Gravity
Don't mean too much to me
I'm who I've got to be.
These pigs are after me, after you
Run away, like it was yesterday
When we would run away,
When we could run away, run away from here.

I'm shooting out of this room
Because I sure don't like the company
Stop your preaching right there
'Cause I really don't care and I'll do it again.

So get me out of my head.
'Cause it's getting kinda cramped, you know.
Coming ready or not
When the motor gets hot, we can do it again.

The papers say,
Johnny won't you come back home?
'Cause everyone knows you don't
- Wanna give yourself up
Tell the truth and God will save you

Gravity
Don't mean too much to me
I'm who I've got to be
These pigs are after me, after you
Run away, like it was yesterday
And we could run away,
If we could run away, run away from here.

And though I know how much you hate this
Are you gonna be the one to save us
From the black and hopeless feeling
Will you mean it when the end comes reeling?

Hold your heart into this darkness
Will it ever be the light to shine you out
Or fall and leave you stranded
I ain't gonna be the one left standing.
You ain't gonna be the one left standing.
We ain't gonna be the one left standing.

Gravity
Don't mean too much to me
Is this our destiny
This world is after me, after you
Run away, like it was yesterday
And we could run away, run away, run away,
Run away from here!

Yeah!

Away from here,
Away from here.

My Chemical Romance RULES!
