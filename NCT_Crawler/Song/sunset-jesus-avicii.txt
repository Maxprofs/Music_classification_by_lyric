                        Bài hát: Sunset Jesus - Avicii 

Tried to set myself up for the win
So people gotta be not so much bigger than the town they're in
So give me love, give me love, give me peace, give me peace of mind
I know that this is enough to a start and I need a little help with mine

California, don't let me down
Seems so golden, but there's trouble all around
Sunset Jesus, came to me
He once was with her, now he's a [?] getting money on the street

My dreams are made of gold
My heart's been broken and I'm down along the road
But I don't, my [?] keep saying til I get home
Wait for me, wait for me, I'll be okay

Staring at the [?] boards on the bus
Looking at the faces, thinking that could be anyone of us
So give me hope, give me hope, give me hope on this lonely ride
Cause I know one day, I will be the one in the sky

California, don't let me down
Seems so golden, but there's trouble all around
Sunset Jesus, came to me
He once was with her, now he's a [?] getting money on the street

My dreams are made of gold
My heart's been broken and I'm down along the road
But I don't, my [?] keep saying til I get home
Wait for me, wait for me
Sunset Jesus

My dreams are made of gold
My heart's been broken and I'm down along the road
But I don't, my [?] keep saying til I get home
Wait for me, wait for me, I'll be okay
My dreams are made of gold
My heart's been broken and I'm down along the road
But I don't, my [?] keep saying til I get home
Wait for me, wait for me, I'll be okay
