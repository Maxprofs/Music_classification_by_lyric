                        I know you can feel the magic baby
 Turn the mother**** lights down
 Esco whuttup?
 I mean, it's what you expected ain't it?
 Let's go Turn the music up and the headphones
 Yeah, that's perfect
 You got to take your time make a **** wait on this mother****
 You make **** mad and **** like **** usually start rappin' after 4-bars
 **** go in
 Let's start dancin' in this mother****
 Yeah, we just come outta nowhere I feel like a Black Republican, money I got comin' in
 Can't turn my back on the hood, I got love for them
 Can't clean my act up for good, too much thug in 'em
 Probably end up back of the hood, I'm like '**** it then' Huddlin' over the oven, we was like brothers then
 Though you was nothin' other than a son of my mother's friend
 We had governin', who would of thought the love would end
 Like ice cold album, all good things Neva thought we sing the same song that all hood sang
 Thought it was all wood-grain, all good brain
 You wouldn't bicker like the other fools talk good game
 Neva imagine all the disasters that one could reign Could bring, should blame the game, and I could
 It's kill or be killed, how could I refrain?
 And foreva be in debt, that's neva a good thing
 To the pressure for success can put a good strain On a friend you call best and yes it could bring
 Out the worst in every person, even the good an' sane
 Though we rehearsed, it just ain't the same
 When you put in the game at age sixteen Then you mix things like cars, jewelry and miss things
 Jealousy, ego and pride, and this brings
 It all to a head like a coin, cha-ching
 The route evil strikes again, this could sting Now the team got beef between the Post and the Point
 This puts the ring in jeopardy indefinitely I feel like a Black Republican, money I got comin' in
 Can't turn my back on the hood, I got love for them
 Can't clean my act up for good, too much thug in 'em
 Probably end up back of the hood, I'm like '**** it then' I feel like a black militant takin' over the government
 Can't turn my back on the hood, too much love for them
 Can't clean my act up for good, too much thug in 'em
 Probably end up back in the hood, I'm like, '**** it then' I'm back in the hood, they like, 'Hey Nas'
 Blowin' on purp', reflectin' on they lives
 Couple of fat cats, couple of A.I.'s
 Dreamin' of fly **** instead of them gray skies Gray 5's, hatah's wishin' our reign dies
 Pitch, sling pies, and **** they sing, "Why"?
 Guess they ain't strong enough to handle their jail time
 Weak minds, keep tryin', follow the street signs I'm standin' on the roof of my building
 I'm feelin' the whirlwind of beef, I inhale it
 Just like an acrobat ready to hurl myself through the hoops of fire
 Sippin' 80 proof, bulletproof under my attire Could it be the forces of darkness
 Against hood angels of good that forms street politics
 Makes a sweet honest kid turn illegal for commerce
 To get his feet out of them Converse, that's my word I feel like a Black Republican, money keep comin' in
 Can't turn my back on the hood, I got love for them
 Can't clean my act up for good, too much thug in 'em
 Probably end up back of the hood, I **** it then I feel like a black militant takin' over the government
 Can't turn my back on the hood, too much love for them
 Can't clean my act up for good, too much thug in 'em
 Probably end up back in the hood, I'm like, '**** it then'
