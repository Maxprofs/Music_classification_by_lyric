                        Bài hát: Price Tag (Jessie J Cover) - J.Fla

Seems like every body's got a price 
I wonder how they sleep at night 
When the sale comes first 
And the truth comes second 
Just stop, for a minute and smile. 

Why is everybody so serious 
Acting so damn mysterious 
You got your shades on your eyes 
And your heels so high 
That you can't even have a good time. 

Everybody look to their left (yeah) 
Everybody look to their right 
Can you feel that (yeah) 
Well playing with love tonight

It's not about the money, money, money 
We don't need your money, money, money 
We just wanna make the world change 
Forget about the price tag. 

Ain't about the (uh) cha-ching cha-ching 
Aint about the (yeah) ba-bling ba-bling 
Wanna make the world dance 
Forget about the price tag. 

We need to take it back in time 
When music made us all unite 
And it wasn't low blows and video hoes 
Am i the only one gettin tired? 

Why is everybody so obsessed 
Money can't buy us happiness 
If we all slow down and enjoy right now 
Gurantee we'll be feelin 
All right. 

Everybody look to their left (yeah) 
Everybody look to their right 
Can you feel that (yeah) 
Well playing with love tonight. 

It's not about the money, money, money 
We don't need your money, money, money 
We just wanna make the world dance 
Forget about the price tag. 

Ain't about the (uh) cha-ching cha-ching 
Aint about the (yeah) ba-bling ba-bling 
Wanna make the world dance 
Forget about the price tag. 

Lala-lala- lalala ay 
Lala-lala-lalal a ay 
Lala-lala-lalal a ay 
Price tag!
