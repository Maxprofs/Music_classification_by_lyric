                        I can almost see it 
That dream I'm dreaming but 
There's a voice inside my head sayin, 
You'll never reach it, 
Every step I'm taking, 
Every move I make feels 
Lost with no direction 
My faith is shaking but I 
Got to keep trying 
Got to keep my head held high 

There's always gonna be another mountain 
I'm always gonna wanna make it move 
Always gonna be an uphill battle, 
Sometimes you're gonna have to lose, 
Ain't about how fast I get there, 
Ain't about what's waiting on the other side 
It's the climb 

The struggles I'm facing, 
The chances I'm taking 
Sometimes they knock me down but 
No I'm not breaking 
I might not know it 
But these are the moments that 
I'm gonna remember most yeah 
Just got to keep going 
And I, 
I got to be strong 
Just keep pushing on, cause 

There's always gonna be another mountain 
I'm always gonna wanna make it move 
Always gonnna be an uphill battle, 
Sometimes I'm gonna have to lose, 
Ain't about how fast I get there, 
Ain't about what's waiting on the other side 
It's the climb 

There's always gonna be another mountain 
I'm always gonna want to make it move 
Always gonna be an uphill battle, 
Sometimes you're gonna have to lose, 
Ain't about how fast I get there, 
Ain't about what's waiting on the other side 
It's the climb 

Keep on moving 
Keep climbing 
Keep the faith baby 
It's all about 
It's all about 
The climb 
Keep the faith 
Keep your faith
