                        Bài hát: Morning Light - Justin Timberlake, Alicia Keys

[Verse 1: Justin Timberlake]
Look, every time there's a new sunrise
I open up my eyes
And I say to myself, "In the whole wide world of guys
I must be the luckiest alive"

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake]
Because I'm in love with you
Laying here, in the morning light
And all I want to do is hold you tight, just one more night

[Verse 2: Alicia Keys]
Look, I can't even get out of bed
With the thoughts you putting in my head
So I say to myself, "I don't even want to try"
Here, every part of me is paralyzed

[Chorus: Alicia Keys & Justin Timberlake]
'Cause I'm in love with you
Laying here in the morning light
And all I want to do is hold you tight just one more night
Yes I'm in love with you
Laying here in the morning light
And all I want to do is hold you tight, just one more night

[Verse 3: Justin Timberlake]
I know I got somewhere to go
But I'm thinking we should lay here in love (lay here in love)
Ooh, 'cause baby, it's no lie
Ooh, I could watch you 'til the day I die

[Chorus: Justin Timberlake & Alicia Keys]
'Cause I'm in love with you
Laying here in the morning light
And all I want to do is hold you tight just one more night
Yes, I'm in love with you
Laying here in the morning light
And all I want to do
Is hold you tight, just one more, one more night
                        
                    |
