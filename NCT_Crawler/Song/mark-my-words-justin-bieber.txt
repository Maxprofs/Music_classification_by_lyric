                        Bài hát: Mark My Words - Justin Bieber

Mark my words
That's all that i have
Mark my words
Give you all i got
And every way i will
You're the only reason why
Oh I don't wanna live a lie
Mark my words
Mark my words
So you heard it all before
Falling in and out of truth
Trying to rekindle us
Only to lose yourself
But I won't let me lose you
And I won't let us just fade away
After all that we've been through
I'ma show you more than I ever could say
Yeah.............
