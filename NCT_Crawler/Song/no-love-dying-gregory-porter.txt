                        Bài hát: No Love Dying - Gregory Porter

There will be no love that's dying here 
The bird that flew in through my window 
Simply lost his way. 
He broke his wing I helped him heal and then he flew away 
Well the death of love is everywhere 
But I wont let it be, 
There will be no love dying here for me. 
There will be no love that's dying here 
The mirror that fell from the wall was tragedy that's all, 
It rests upon a rusty nail 
Before it made it's fall 
Well the bones of love are every where but I wont let it be, 
There will be no love dying here for me. 
There will be no that's dying here 
Four flowers is my aging faces, not a sign within 
I payed for three a sweet old lady gave me four instead 
There's some doubt that's out about this love but I wont let it be, 
There will be no love that's dying here for me. 
There will be no love that's dying here 
The bird that flew in through my window 
Simply lost his way 
He broke his wing I helped him heal and then he flew away 
Well the death of love is everywhere 
But I wont let it be, 
There will be no love dying here for me 
No-o-o-o oh 
There will be no love that's dying for me 
There will be no love that's dying for you and me 
Oh there will be no love dying here 
No-o not for me 
There will be no love that's dying here 
No-o-o 
There will be no love that's dying here 
No no no no no no no no no no no 
There will be no lo-o-o-ve dying for me.
