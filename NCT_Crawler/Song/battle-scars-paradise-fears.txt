                        Bài hát: Battle Scars - Paradise Fears

Oh-ohhhh-oh-ohhhh
Oh-ohhhh-oh-ohhhh
Oh-ohhhh-oh-ohhhh-ohhhhh

Oh-ohhhh-oh-ohhhh
Oh-ohhhh-oh-ohhhh
Oh-ohhhh-oh-ohhhh-ohhhhh

This is an anthem for the homesick, for the beaten,
the lost, the broke, the defeated.
A song for the heartsick, for the standbys,
Living life in the shadow of goodbye.

Do you remember when we learned how to fly?
We'd play make-believe; we were young and had time on our side.
You're stuck on the ground, 
Got lost, can't be found.
Just remember that you're still alive.

I'll carry you home.
No, you're not alone.
Keep marching on,
This is worth fighting for,
You know we've all got battle scars.
You've had enough,
But just don't give up.
Stick to your guns, 
You are worth fighting for.
You know we've all got battle scars.
Keep marching on.

This is a call to the soldiers, the fighters,
the young, the innocent, and righteous.
We've got a little room to grow.
Better days are near,
Hope is so much stronger than fear.

So if you jump, kid, don't be scared to fall.
We'll be kings and queens in this dream, all for one, one for all.
You can light up the dark,
There's a fire in your heart,
Burner brighter than ever before.

I'll carry you home.
No, you're not alone.
Keep marching on,
This is worth fighting for,
You know we've all got battle scars.
You've had enough,
But just don't give up.
Stick to your guns, 
You are worth fighting for.
You know we've all got battle scars.
Keep marching on.

On and on, like we're living on a broken record.
Hope is strong, but misery's a little quicker.
Sit, and we wait, and we drown there,
Thinking, "Why bother play when it's unfair?"
They say life's a waste, I say they lack belief.
They tell me luck will travel, I tell 'em that's why I've got feet.
Left, right, left, right,
Moving along to the pulse of a heartbeat.
This could be the last chance you have to fly.
Do you like the ground? Want it to pass you by?
Man, you had it all when you were just kid.
Do you even remember who you were back then?
What do you want in life? Will you be twice as strong?
What would you sacrifice? What are you waiting on?
Don't stop, march on.

I'll carry you home.
No, you're not alone.
Keep marching on,
This is worth fighting for,
You know we've all got battle scars.
You've had enough,
But just don't give up.
Stick to your guns, 
You are worth fighting for.
You know we've all got battle scars.
Keep marching on.

Oh-ohhhh-oh-ohhhh
Oh-ohhhh-oh-ohhhh
Oh-ohhhh-oh-ohhhh-ohhhhh

Oh-ohhhh-oh-ohhhh
Oh-ohhhh-oh-ohhhh
Oh-ohhhh-oh-ohhhh-ohhhhh

Keep marching on.
