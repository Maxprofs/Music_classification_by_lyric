                        Bài hát: Don't Stop Believin' (Glee Cast Version) (Rachel Solo Audition Version) - Glee Cast, Lea Michele

Rachel:
Oooh
Just a small town girl
Livin' in a lonely world
She took the midnight train goin' anywhere

Just a city boy
Born and raised in South Detroit
He took the midnight train goin' anywhere

Rachel with the Group vocalizing (with the Group):
A singer in a smokey room
A smell of wine and cheap perfume
For a smile they can share the night
It goes on and on and on and on

(Strangers waiting)
Up and down the boulevard
Their (shadows searching) in the night
(Streetlights, people)
Livin' just to find emotion
(Hiding somewhere) in the night!

Oooh!
Workin' hard to get my fill
Everybody wants a thrill
Payin' anything to roll the dice 
Just one more time

Some will win
Some will lose
Some were born to sing the blues
Oh, the movie never ends
It goes on and on and on and on

(Strangers waiting)
Up and down the boulevard
Their (shadows searching) in the night
Ooh (Streetlights, people)
Livin' just to find emotion
(Hiding somewhere) in the night!

Rachel with the Group (Rachel):
(Woah, ooh!)
Don't stop believin'
(Hold on to that feelin')
Streetlights, people, ooh! (The Group: Whoa, oh)
Don't stop believin'
(Hold on!)
Street lights people, ooh! (The Group: Whoa, oh)
Don't stop!
