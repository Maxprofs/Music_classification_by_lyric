                        Hey, did you hear about the one that got away?
 They say he looked left, she turned right
 Meant to be together but not that night
 It's when fate's running late, we tend to make mistakes We go 'round and 'round from love to love
 It's either way too much or not enough
 Gimme lazy days with nothing better to do than singing Old black water keep on rolling while I wait for you
 I don't care if it rains, I'll be just fine
 I'm leaving the ghosts behind until I got you, I got you
 You're the sun through my window warming my skin
 Oh you, I got you, hey Then when one of them was taken
 The other one was waiting for the next big thing
 To bring them to the gates of heaven
 Or maybe just a late night in Vegas It's true that's what we do when we're going down swinging
 Then coming up singing the blues, wearing out my shoes
 Chasing new faces to get to you
 Driving home on a summer night singing Old black water keep on rolling till the time is right
 I don't care if it rains, I'll be just fine
 Sit back, enjoy the ride until I got you, I got you
 You're the sun through my window warming my skin
 Oh you, I got you like Sonny and Cher except I'll be there for you
 I got you, let old black water bring us together Old black water keep on rolling
 Mississippi moon, won't you keep on shining on me?
 Old black water keep on rolling
 Mississippi moon, won't you keep on shining on me? Wanna hear some funky Dixieland
 Pretty mama, come and take me by the hand
 Wanna hear some funky Dixieland
 Pretty mama, here she comes I got you, I got you
 You're the sun through my window warming my skin
 Oh you, I got you like Sonny and Cher you know I'll be there for you
 I got you, let old black water bring us together
 You, I got you, I got you, I got you, baby By the hand, hand, take me by the hand, pretty mama
 Dance with your daddy all night long
 Wanna hear some funky Dixieland
 Pretty mama, come and take me by the hand By the hand, hand, take me by the hand, pretty mama
 Dance with your daddy all night long
 Wanna hear some funky Dixieland
 Pretty mama, come and take me by the hand By the hand, hand, take me by the hand, pretty mama
 Dance with your daddy all night long
 Wanna hear some funky Dixieland
 Pretty mama, come and take me by the hand
