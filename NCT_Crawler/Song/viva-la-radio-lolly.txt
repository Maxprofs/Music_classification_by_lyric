                        Viva, viva, viva la radio
How I love my radio
I take it with me wherever i go
How I love to hear the sound
I like to play it nice and loud
Radio, that's it, I love it
Radio, turn it up, turn it up
Radio, louder, louder
Radio, I love it, I love it
Viva, viva, viva la radio (4 times)
How I wish I was a DJ
I'd play my favorite music everyday
Radio Lolly is what it would be
And you can come and dance and party with me.
