                        Bài hát: What Is Love? - Ayo

I love you is so easy to say 
But so many times it doesn't mean a thing 
I love you could be everything 
As long as we don't know what love means I think love is not in what we say 
Love is in what we do 
And when we say we love 
We got something to prove What is love? 
What is love? 
What is love? 
What is love? I think love is nothing but the truth 
Something inside of me and something inside of you 
Love is faith and loyalty 
Love is sharing, love is to believe I think that is what love could be 
And so much more 'cause love is deep 
Love is deep What is love? 
What is love? 
What is love? 
What is love? I think love can be good, love can be bad 
Love can make you happy and love can make you sad 
Love can break your heart and love can heal your soul I think love can be good, love can be bad 
Love can make you happy and love can make you sad 
Love can break your heart and love can heal your soul 
Love can die, love can grow
                        
                    |
