                        I was sure I heard you singin'
 While my head was broken up
 While my world in flames was rearranged
 Oh, I, I'm still here In a blazin' forest fire
 In a web of my own desires
 In a place that we are destined to return On an ocean I can't fathom
 In a truth I can't unravel
 Oh, I'm still here
 Oh, I'm still here
 I'm still here
                        
                    |
