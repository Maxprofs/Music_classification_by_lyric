I'm in the mood for love
()
i'm in the mood for love,
simply because you're near me
funny,but when you're near me
i'm in the mood for love,
heaven is in your eyes,
bright as the stars we're under.
oh! is it any wonder,
i'm in the mood for love?
why stop to think of whether
this little dream might fade?
we've put our hearts together,
now we are one,
i'm not afaid!
if there's a cloud above,
if it should rain we'll let it!
but for tonight,
forget it!
i'm in the mood for love.love
