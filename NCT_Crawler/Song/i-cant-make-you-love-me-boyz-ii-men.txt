                        I cant make you love me Turn down the lights, turn down the bed
 Turn down these voices inside my head
 Lay down with me and tell me no lies
 Just hold me close and dont patronize
 Dont patronize me Cause I cant make you love me if you dont
 You cant make your heart feel something that it wont
 Here in the dark, in these finals hours
 I will lay down my heart til I feel the power
 But you wont, no you wont
 Cause I cant make you love me if you dont Ill close my eyes then I wont see
 The love you dont feel when youre holding me
 Morning will come and ill do whats right
 Just give me til then to give up this fight
 And I will give up this fight Cause I cant make you love me if you dont
 You cant make your heart feel something that it wont
 Here in the dark, in these finals hours
 I will lay down my heart til I feel the power
 But you wont, no you wont
 Cause I cant make you love me if you dont Just let me hold you baby one more time
 And maybe tonight I can change your mind
 And make you love me like you did before
 Leave a feeling in your heart you cant ignore
 I feel that baby we can make this right
 If you just give me one more night
 I feel that were worth it and I think we deserve it
 If you feel that we dont have a chance Then I cant make you love me if you dont
 You cant make your heart feel something that it wont
 Here in the dark, in these finals hours
 I will lay down my heart til I feel the power
 But you wont, no you wont
 Cause I cant make you love me if you dont
