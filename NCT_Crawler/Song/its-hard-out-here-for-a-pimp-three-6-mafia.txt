                        Song: It's Hard Out Here For A Pimp - Three 6 Mafia

You know it's hard out here for a pimp
When he tryin' to get this money for the rent
For the Cadillacs and gas money spent
Because a whole lot of bitches talkin' ***.

You know it's hard out here for a pimp
When he tryin' to get this money for the rent
For the Cadillacs and gas money spent
Will have a whole lot of bitches jumpin' ship.

1. In my eyes I done seen some crazy thangs in the streets
Gotta couple girl workin' on the changes for me
But I gotta keep my game tight like Kobe on game night
Like takin' from a girl don't know no better, I know that ain't right.

Done seen people killed, done seen people deal
Done seen people live in poverty with no meals
It's messed up where I live but that's just how it is
It might be new to you but it's been like this for years.

It's blood sweat and tears when it come down to a lick
I'm tryin' to get rich 'fore I leave up out it
I'm tryin' to have thangs but it's hard for a pimp
So I'm prayin' and I'm hopin' to God I don't slip, yeah.
