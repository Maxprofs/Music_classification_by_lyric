                        Saw you 'round the other day,
 Shorty she was all the way
 Looked like you were feeling me
 So I had to come and see
 Girl he wasn't tryin' to hate
 But she had to demonstrate
 That she was the queen to be
 But she couldn't fight the chemistry
 and I say...
 I, I, I,
 I can't lose you, no
 I, I, I,
 Nooooo [chorus]
 She was disco lights on a Friday night
 She moves across the floor
 Suga!
 She was o so tight like dynamite
 Blowin' me up with her love
 She was on the phone with me
 All night long
 I just can't get enough
 She was ah ah oh, ah ah oh
 Blowin' me up with her love
 Uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh uh Girl its just the sexy way
 You back yourself into me
 You're more then just a pretty face
 You're better then a fantasy
 Come on baby
 Don't ignore me
 I know what you're feeling for me
 You can't fight it
 Cause you want me
 Don't you miss this or you'll be sorry
 So tell me what it's gonna take
 You've got me all bent out of shape
 Thinking bout you all day
 And how you gonna make me wait
 and I say..
 I I I
 I can't lose you no
 I I I
 Whoaaaa [chorus]
 She was disco lights on a Friday night
 She moves across the floor

 She was o so tight like dynamite
 Blowin' me up with her love
 She was on the phone with me
 All night long
