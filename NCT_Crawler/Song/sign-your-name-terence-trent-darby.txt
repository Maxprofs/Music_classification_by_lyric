                        Bài hát: Sign Your Name - Terence Trent D'Arby

Fortunately you have got someone who relies on you

We started out as friends
but the thought of you just caves me in.
The symptoms are so deep
it is much too late to turn away.
We started out as friends -

Sign your name across my heart
I want you to be my baby

Sign your name across my heart
I want you to be my lady.

Time
I'm sure
will bring disappointments in so many things

It seems to be the way when you're gambling cards on love you play.
I'd rather be in hell with you
baby
than in cool heaven.
It seems to be the way -

Sign your name across my heart
I want you to be my baby
. . .

Birds never look into the sun before the day is done

Oh
the light shines brighter on a peaceful day.
Stranger blue
leave us alone
we don't want to deal with you

We'll shed our stains showering in the room that makes the rain.

AII alone with you makes the butterflies in me arise

Slowly we make love and the earth rotates to our dictates.
Slowly we make love -
Sign your name across my heart
I want you to be my baby
. . .
Sign your name across my heart
I want you to be my baby
. . .
Sign your name across my heart
I want you to be my baby
                        
                    |
