                        Now there's something coming through the air
 That softly reminds me
 Tonight, I'll park out on the hill
 And wait until they find me You're slipping through the ether
 A voice is coming through
 So keep me in your heart tonight
 And I'll save my love for you So turn up your radio
 And, darling dial me in close
 We're riding on the airwaves
 And we're traveling coast to coast Over river and highway
 Your voice comes clear and true
 Though we're far apart tonight
 I'll save my love for you Hold me in your arms
 And our doubts won't break us
 If we open up our hearts
 Love won't forsake us
 Just let the music take us
 And carry us home There's a prayer coming through the air
 And it shot straight through my heart
 Tearing open the evening sky
 And tearing me apart Now I'll ride that signal down the line
 Till I'm home again with you
 So turn up your radio
 And I'll save my love for you
 So turn up your radio
 And I'll save my love for you
                        
                    |
