                        if you need me, call me 
No matter Where you are
No matter how far
just call my name
I'll be there in a harry
on that you can depand
(and never worry)
( No wind) ( No wind)
( No rain) ( No rain)
(Nor winter's cold )
( Can stop me, babe ) ( oh babe)
( baby) ( baby )
( If you are my goal )
( No wind) ( No wind)
( No rain) ( No rain)
( Can stop me, babe ) 
if you wanna go
.......
I know
I know you must follow the sun
Wherever it leads
( But remember)
( If you should fall short)
( of your desires )
( Remember life holds for you )
(one guarantee )
