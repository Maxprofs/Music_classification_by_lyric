                        Bài hát: Doorway - Elliott Yamin

Don't it make you feel like running?
Baby, don't you feel it coming?
Standing in a building burning
A million pictures of the years you loved him.
Baby,
They're shaking all the walls.
Baby,
They're trying to make you fall.
Baby, (ohh)
They wanted you to break.
Baby,
You're standing in the doorway.

You're safe,
You're standing in the middle of a doorway.
I know it's off the richter girl,
But you're safe.
You're safe, earthquaking away,
But you're safe today.
Because you're standing in the middle of a doorway.

(Oeh-oeh-oeh)
It's up to you.
What you gon' do?
It's up to you.

Don't it make you feel like hiding?
Burned ya, now you're scared to fight it.
If you're in the doorway now,
Don't that mean you made it out?
Baby,
Baby,
Ah Baby.
They're shaking up the walls,
(Shaking up the walls.)
Baby.
Baby,
They're trying to make you fall.

Oeh...

Baby oh baby
They wanted you to break,
(They wanted you to break.)
Baby, (yeah)
You're standing in the doorway.

You're safe,
You're standing in the middle of a doorway
I know it's off the richter girl,
But you're safe.
You're safe, earthquaking away,
But you're safe today.
Because you're standing in the middle of a doorway.

You're not there by yourself...
You don't any help!

You're not there by yourself...
You don't any help!

Heeeee-eaaaa

You're safe,
You're standing in the middle of a doorway.
I know it's off the richter girl, (Oeh)
But you're safe.
You're safe, earthquaking away,
But you're safe today. (Uh-ohh)
Because you're standing in the middle of a doorway
Standing in the middle of a doorway
Standing in the middle of a doorway
Standing in the middle of a doorway
Standing in the middle of a doorway
