                        Bài hát: Summer Is Like A Dream - Khai Dreams

Man I swear last summer was like a dream
Feels like last summer was like a dream
And I’m tryna figure out-I’m just tryna figure out what it means
Yeah I’m tryna figure out what it means

It’s such a tragedy to stay inside on peaceful summer days
But I got nobody calling me, I stay behind the shades
I was thinking bout the days, how they weren’t even a thing
Wasting hours watching ceilings, clouds passing through shades
As I wonder why I never said the words I had to say
As I watch the summer slowly fade away with Autumn’s day
Pink and white and blue and green and warmth that makes me tired
Bright eyes from quite stares, moments to admire
Now they’re hazes in my memories just places that I used to be
I wish I could return but know that I could never stay
No I can’t call it a home it’s just a stop along the way
And I don’t know where I’m going but it seems I’ll be okay if

Last summer was like a dream
Feels like last summer was like a dream
And I’m tryna figure out-I’m just tryna figure out what it means
Yeah I’m tryna figure out what it means

Rain don’t fall like it used to
The sun gets hotter every year
The people that I know slowly moving away
They’re moving towards everything that I have feared
Autumn fades back into the winter
The winter fades back into the spring
When the summer comes around it will go around again
It will all be just like a dream
Summer is like a dream
Like a dream, like a dream, like a dream
Summer is like a dream
