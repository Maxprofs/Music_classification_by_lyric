                        Come away with me now to the sky
Up all the hills and the sea
Far beyond where memories lie
To a place where Im free to be me

Oh Gather it now one and all
No matter what folly may do
Let the stars fill your soul, when the moon cradles all
So, to yourself be true!

The blanket of snow is all gone
Each flower waits for the sun
And the breeze bring tears of the rain
Oh Its promise for everyone

Then come away with me, friends!
No matter where you call your home
With the light in your hearts
We will never part
No matter how far we roam

Deep in the forest we go
Creatures are all fast asleep
With a kiss and a wink we will waken our souls
And long is the safety we'll keep

And then, then well dance with the night
Till the sun peeking sparkle at dawn
And away we will go
Like last winters snow
Soon our work will be done.

Oh gather it now one and all
No matter what folly may do
Let the stars fill your soul, when the moon cradles all
So, to yourself be true
So, to yourself be true
                        
                    |
