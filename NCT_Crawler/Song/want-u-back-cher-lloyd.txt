                        SONG: Want U Back (Radio Edit) - Cher Lloyd

Ugh!
 Mm, yeah
 La la la la la, ha ha
 Ugh!

 Hey, boy you never had much game
 Thought I needed to upgrade
 So I went and walked away way way
 Ugh!
 Now, I see you've been hanging out
 With that other girl in town
 Looking like a pair of clowns clowns clowns
 Ugh!

 Remember all the things that you and I did first?
 And now you're doing them with her
 Remember all the things that you and I did first?
 You got me, got me like this: Ugh!
 And now you're taking her to every restaurant
 And everywhere we went, come on!
 And now you're taking her to every restaurant
 You got me, got me like this: Ugh!

 Boy you can say anything you wanna
 I don't give a shh, no one else can have ya
 I want you back, I want you back
 Wa-want you, want you back
 Ugh!
 I broke it off thinking you'd be cryin'
 Now I feel like shh looking at you flyin'
 I want you back, I want you back
 Wa-want you, want you back
 Ugh!

 Please, this ain't even jealousy
 She ain't got a thing on me
 Tryin' to rock them ug-a-ly jeans jeans jeans
 Ugh!
 You clearly didn't think this through
 If what I've been told is true
 You'll be crawling back like boo hoo hoo
 Ugh!

 Remember all the things that you and I did first?
 And now you're doing them with her
 Remember all the things that you and I did first?
 You got me, got me like this: Ugh!
 And now you're taking her to every restaurant
 And everywhere we went, come on!
 And now you're taking her to every restaurant
 You got me, got me like this: Ugh!

 Boy you can say anything you wanna
 I don't give a shh, no one else can have ya
 I want you back, I want you back
 Wa-want you, want you back
 Ugh!
 I broke it off thinking you'd be cryin'
 Now I feel like shh looking at you flyin'
 I want you back, I want you back
 Wa-want you, want you back
 Ugh!

 Ohhh, I thought you'd still be mine
 When I kissed you goodbye uh oh, uh oh
 Ohhh, and you might be with her
 But I still had you first uh oh, uh oh

 Remember all the things that you and I did first?
 And now you're doing them with her
 Remember all the things that you and I did first?
 Yo!
 Remember all the things that you and I did first?
 And now you're doing them with her
 Remember all the things that you and I did first?
 You got me, got me like this: Oh!

 Boy you can say anything you want
 I don't give a shh, no one else can have ya
 I want you back, I want you back
 Wa-want you, want you back
 Ugh!
 I broke it off thinking you'd be cryin'
 Now I feel like shh looking at you flyin'
 I want you back, I want you back
 Wa-want you, want you back (Ugh!)

 Ohhh, I want you back
 I want you back
 Wa-want you, want you back

 Ohhh, I want you back
 I want you back
 Wa-want you, want you back
                        
                    |
