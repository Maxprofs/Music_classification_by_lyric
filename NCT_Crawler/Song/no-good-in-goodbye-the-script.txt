                        Bài hát: No Good In Goodbye - The Script

All the things that we have lost
Breaking up comes at a cost
I know I miss this mistake
Every word I try to choose
Either way I'm gonna lose
Can't take the ache from heartbreak
Ohh but as you walk away, you don't hear me say

Chorus:
Where's the good in goodbye?
Where's the nice in nice try?
Where's the us in trust gone?
Where's the soul in soldier on?
No w I'm the low in lonely
'Cause I don't own you only
I can take this mistake but
I can't take the ache from heartbreak
No, I can't take the ache from heartbreak

No matter how it falls apart
There's an art in breaking hearts
But there's no fair in farewell, no
And when I see you in the street
I pray to God you don't see
The silent hell in I wish you well
Ohh but as you walk away, you don't hear me say

Chorus:
Where's the good in goodbye?
Where's the nice in nice try?
Where's the us in trust gone?
Where's the soul in soldier on?
No w I'm the low in lonely
'Cause I don't own you only
I can take this mistake but
I can't take the ache from heartbreak

[x4:]
(Take the ache, take the ache) I can't take the ache from heartbreak

[x2:]
If I could, turn back time
Then I would, rewrite those lines

[x2:]
If I could, turn back time
I would, rewrite those lines

Chorus:
Where's the good in goodbye?
Where's the nice in nice try?
Where's the us in trust gone?
Where's the soul in soldier on?
No w I'm the low in lonely
'Cause I don't own you only
I can take this mistake but
I can't take the ache from heartbreak

[x4:]
(Take the ache, take the ache) I can't take the ache from heartbreak

If I could, turn back time
Then I would, rewrite those lines
                        
                    |
