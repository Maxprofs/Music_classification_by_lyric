                        I'm hot
You're cold
You go around
Like you know
Who I am
But you don't
You've got me on my toes

[Chorus:]
I'm slipping into the lava
And I'm tryin' to keep from going under
Baby, who turned the temperature hotter?
'Cause I'm burning up, burning up
For you baby

I fell (I fell)
So fast (so fast)
Can't hold myself
Back
High heels (high heels)
Red dress (red dress)
All by yourself, gotta catch my breath

[Chorus]
Walk in the room
All I can see is you
You're staring me down
I know you feel it too

[Chorus x2]

[Big Rob rap:]
Burning up in this place tonight
Gonna sing it loud
And we're feeling right
Get up and dance
Don't try to fight it
Big Rob's for real
And that's no lie
Stop drop and roll
And touch the floor
Keep on burning up more and more
I got JB with me
Layin' it down
Come on boys lets bring the chorus around

[Chorus]
Burning up, burning up
For you baby
                        
                    |
