Stealing all my love back 
Giving it to him

I thought your love was all that 
Until I let him in 

Oh whoa

That's moping 

Oh whoa 

You're gonna be the one (x2) 
When I'm not having fun 
You're gonna be the one that's broken 

Oh whoa 

My new boy knows the way I want it 
He's got more swagger than you

My new boy really likes to flaunt this

Stealing all my love back 
Giving it to him

And just lay there alone yeah you got what you wanted 
On your hands and knees
