R&B/Hip Hop/Rap|

                        Whatever
Dre just let it run, aye yo, turn the beat up a lil' bit
Aye yo this song if for anyone, * it
Shut up and listen aye yo

I sit back with the pack of zig zags and this bag
Of this weed it gives me the * needed to be
The most meanest MC on this earth
And since birth I've been cursed with this curse to just curse

And just blirk, it's bazerk and bizare * that works
And it sells and it helps in itself to relieve all this tension
Dispensin' me sentence is gettin' the stress that's been eatin' me
Recently off of this chest and I rest again peacefully

But at least have the decency in you to leave me alone
When you freaks see me out in the streets
When I'm eatin' or feedin' my daughter to not come and speak to me
I don't know you and no I don't owe you a mutha' fuckin' thing

I'm not Mr. N SYNC I'm not what your friends think
I'm not Mr. Friendly I can be a * if you tempt me
My tank is on empty, no patients is in me and if you offend me
I'm lifting you ten feet in the air

I don't care who was there and who saw me destroy you
I'll call you a lawyer file you a law suite
I'll smile in the court room and buy you a wardsrobe I'm tired of arguin'
I don't mean to be mean but that's all I can be it's just me

And I am whatever you say I am
If I wasn't then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news, everyday I am
Radio won't even play my jam

'Cause I am whatever you say I am
If I wasn't then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news, everyday I am
I don't know that's just the way I am

Sometimes I just feel like my father I hate to be bothered
With all of this nonsense, it's constant
And oh it's his lyrical content the song 'Guilty Conscience'
Has gotten such rotten responses

And all of this controversy circles me and it
Seems the the media immediately
Points a finger at me so I point one back at 'em
But not the index or pinky

Or the ring or the thumb, it's the one you put up
When you don't give a * when you won't just put up
Wit the bullshit they pull 'cause they full of * too
When a dudes gettin bullied and shoos up the school

And they blame it on Marylin and the heroine
Where were the parents at? And look where its at?
Middle America now it's a tragedy
Now it's so sad to see, an upper class city

Havin' this happenin' then attack Eminem
'Cause I rap this way? But I'm glad 'cause they feed me the fuel
That I need for the fire to burn
And it's burnin, and I have returned

And I am whatever you say I am
If I wasn't then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news, everyday I am
Radio won't even play my jam

'Cause I am whatever you say I am
If I wasn't then why would I say I am?
In the paper, the news, everyday I am
I don't know that's just the way I am

I'm so sick and tired of bein' admired
That I wished that I would just die or get fired
And drop from my label and stop wit the fables
I'm not gonna be able to top a 'My Name is'

And pigeon hold in to some poppy sensation
That caught me rotating in rock 'n' roll stations
And I just do not got the patience to deal
With these cocky Cau Casions

Who think I'm some wigger who tries to be black
'Cause I talk wit an accent and grab on my ball
So they always keep askin' the same fuckin' questions
'What school did I go to, what hood I grew up in'

The why, the who, what and the where and the how
Till I'm grabbin' my hair and I'm tearing it out
'Cause they drivin' me crazy
I can't take it, I'm racin', I'm pacing, I stand then I sit
And I'm thankful for every fan that I get

But I can't take a * in the bathro
