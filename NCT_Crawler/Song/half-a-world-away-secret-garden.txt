                        Bài hát: Half A World Away - Secret Garden

You're half a world away
Standing next to me
It seems that everyday
I'm losing you almost invisibly
Though you are near
I can't reach that far
Across to where you are
And so you stay....
Just half a world away

And I would cross
The universe for you
What good would it do
If you weren't even there?

Tall you return
Until your way is clear
I will be here.....
Not half a world away

You're half a world away
And no one is there to blame
If love outlives its day
And turns into an ember from a flame
I love you as before
Till worlds will be no more
Till I can find a way
To where you stay
Just half a world away
                        
                    |
