                        CAN'T ESCAPE MY LOVE 

( ENRIQUE IGLESIAS ) 

Here's how it goes, you and me, 
up and down, but maybe this time 
We'll get right, worth the fight 
Cause love is something you can't shake 
When it breaks 
All it takes is some trying 

If you feel like leaving 
I'm not gonna make you stay 
Soon you'll be finding 
You can run, you can hide 
But you can't escape my love 
You can run, you can hide 
But you can't escape my love 

So if you go 
You should know 
It's hard to just forget the past so fast 
It was good, it was bad but it was real 
And that's all you have 
in the end, our love mattered 

If you feel like leaving 
I'm not gonna make you stay 
Soon you'll be finding 

You can run, you can hide 
But you can't escape my love 
You can run, you can hide 
But you can't escape my love 

(You can run, you can hide 
But you can't escape my love) 
(You can run, you can hide 
But you can't escape my love) 

Here's how it goes 
All it takes is some trying 
You can run 

If you feel like leaving 
I'm not gonna make you stay 
Soon you'll be finding 
You can run, you can hide 
But you can't escape my love 
You can run, you can hide 
But you can't escape my love 

You can run, you can run
                        
                    |
