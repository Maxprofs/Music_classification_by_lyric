                        Bài hát: Come With Me (Deadmeat) - Steve Aoki, Nayer

I dare you to come along with me,
Lets take a walk along the stars,
Leaving this world behind and were drifting,
Go to a place we can feel alive,

So if you're down come with me
Ill bring you up, you'll be happy you're here tonight,
If your down come with, come with, come with me,
So if you're down come with me
Ill bring you up, you'll be happy you're here tonight,
If your down come with, come with, come with me

Away from the city and lights, we'll float across the sky
Come with me, come with me, come with me
Staring in your eyes, constellations start a line
Come with me, come with me, come with me
I dare you to come along with me
Lets take a walk along the stars
Feel the time slow down are you ready
Go to a place where we feel alive

So if you're down come with me
Ill bring you up, you'll be happy you're here tonight,
If your down come with, come with, come with me,
So if you're down come with me
Ill bring you up, you'll be happy you're here tonight,
If your down come with, come with, come with me

Away from the city and lights, we'll float across the sky
Come with me, come with me, come with me,
Staring in your eyes, constellations start a line
Come with me come with me come with me

Away from the city and lights, we'll float across the sky
Come with me, come with me, come with me, come with me
