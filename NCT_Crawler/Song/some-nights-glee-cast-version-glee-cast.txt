                        Bài hát: Some Nights (Glee Cast Version) - Glee Cast

[Blaine with New Directions:]
Some nights, I stay up cashing in my bad luck
Some nights, I call it a draw
Some nights, I wish that my lips could build a castle
Some nights, I wish they'd just fall off

[Jake with New Directions:]
But I still wake up, I still see your ghost
Oh lord, I'm still not sure what I stand for
Oh

[Sam with New Directions:]
What do I stand for? ([New Directions:] Oh whoa!)
What do I stand for? ([New Directions:] Oh whoa!)

[Ryder:]
Most nights, I don't know
Anymore

[New Directions:]
Oh whoa!
Oh whoa!
Oh whoa!
Oh
Oh
Oh whoa!
Oh whoa!
Oh

[Blaine and Sam:]
This is it, boys, this is war ([New Directions:] Oooh!)
What are we waiting for? ([New Directions:] Oh whoa!)
Why don't we break the rules already? ([New Directions:] Oh)

[Ryder and Jake:]
I was never one to believe the hype ([New Directions:] Oh whoa!)
Save that for the black and white ([New Directions:] Oh whoa!)
I try twice as hard and I'm half as liked ([New Directions:] Oh)
But here they come again to jack my style

[Kitty:]
That's alright

[Marley:]
That's alright

[Kitty:]
I found a

[Kitty with Marley:]
Martyr in my bed tonight
Stops my bones from wondering just who I, who I
Who I am
Oh, who am I?
Humm, humm

[Marley:]
Who am I? ([Kitty:] Ooo)
Who am I?

[Blaine with New Directions:]
Well, some nights, I wish that this all would end
Cause I could use some friends for a change

[Ryder with New Directions:]
And some nights, I'm scared you'll forget me again
Some nights, I always win ([Joe:] I always win)

[Jake with New Directions:]
But I still wake up, I still see your ghost
Oh lord, I'm still not sure what I stand for
Oh

[Sam with New Directions:]
What do I stand for? ([New Directions:] Oh!)
What do I stand for? ([New Directions:] Oh whoa!)

[Sam:]
Most nights,
I don't know

[Marley:]
Oh come on!

[Joe:]
So this is it?
I sold my soul for this?
Washed my hands of that for this? ([Marley:] Oh my)
I missed my mom and dad for this? ([Marley:] Oh my my)

[Tina:]
When I see stars ([Marley:] Oh, come on)
When I see, When I see stars, ([Marley:] Oh, come on)
That's all they are, when I hear songs ([Marley:] Oh my my)
They sound like a swan

[Ryder:]
So come on

[Jake:]
Oh, come on

[Kitty:]
Come on

[Marley:]
Oh, come on!

[Blaine and Sam:]
Well, this is it, guys, that is all ([New Directions:] Oh)
Five minutes in and I'm bored again ([New Directions:] Oh whoa!)
Ten years of this, I'm not sure if anybody understands ([New Directions:] Oh)

[Jake and Ryder:]
This one is not for the folks at home ([New Directions:] Oh)
Sorry to leave, mom, I had to go ([New Directions:] Oh whoa!)
Who the heck wants to die alone all dried up in the desert sun? ([New Directions:] Oh)

[Kitty:]
My heart is breaking for my sister
And the con that she called "love"
But when I look into my nephews eyes

[Marley:]
Man, you wouldn't believe
The most amazing things
That can come from
Some terrible lies, yeah, ah woah!

[Kitty:]
Oh! ([Marley:] Ah, yeah, ah)

[Marley:]
Oh whoa whoa!

[New Directions:]
Oh whoa! (Tina: Oh whoa, whoa, whoa!)

[Kitty:]
Oh whoa! ([Tina:] Oh whoa, whoa, whoa!) ([New Directions:] Oh whoa!)
Haaaah ([Tina:] Oh whoa, whoa, whoa!)

[Tina:]
Oh whoa, whoa, whoa! ([New Directions:] Oh whoa!)
Oh whoa, whoa, whoa!
Yeah,

[Kitty with Tina:]
The other night, you wouldn't believe the dream ([New Directions:] Oh!)
I just had about you and me ([New Directions:] Oh whoa!)
I called you up, but we'd both agree ([Marley:] Oh come on!)

[Joe with New Directions:]
It's for the best you didn't listen ([Marley:] Yeah!)
It's for the best we get our distance ([Marley:] Oh!)
For the best you didn't listen ([Marley:] Oh whoa!)
It's for the best we get our distance

[Marley and New Directions:]
Oh,
Oh whoa!
Oh whoa!
Oh
                        
                    |
