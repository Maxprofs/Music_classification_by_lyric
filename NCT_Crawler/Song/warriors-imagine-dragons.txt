                        Bài hát: Warriors - Imagine Dragons

As a child, you would
wait and watch from far away.
But you always knew that you'd be
the one that work while they all play.

And youth, you'd lay, awake at night and
scheme, of all the things you that would change,
but it was just a dream.

Here we are, don't turn away now,
we are the warriors that built this town.
Here we are, don't turn away now,
we are the warriors that built this town from dust.

This time will come when you will have to rise,
Above the best and prove yourself your spirit
never dies.

Farewell, I've gone to take my throne above
But don't weep for me, cause this will be the
labor of my love.

Here we are, don't turn away now,
we are the warriors that built this town.
Here we are, don't turn away now,
we are the warriors that built this town from dust.

Here we are, don't turn away now,
we are the warriors that built this town.
Here we are, don't turn away now,
we are the warriors that built this town from dust.
                        
                    |
