                        Bài hát:Poker Face (Acoustic Version) - Lady Gaga

I wanna hold em' like they do in Texas plays
Fold em' let em' hit me raise it baby stay with me
LoveGame, intuition.
Play the cards with spades to start,
And after he's been hooked,
I'll play the one that's on his heart

Oh, oh, oh, oh, ohhhh, ohh-oh-e-ohh-oh-oh
I'll get him hot, show him what I've got
Oh, oh, oh, oh, ohhhh, ohh-oh-e-ohh-oh-oh
I'll get him hot, show him what I've got

Can't read my,
Can't read my
No he can't read my poker face
He's got me like nobody
Can't read my
Can't read my
No he can't read my poker face
She's got me like nobody

P-P-P-Poker face, P-P-Poker face
P-P-P-Poker face, P-P-Poker face

I wanna roll with him a hard pair we will be
A little gamblin' is fun when you're with me
Russian roulette is not the same without a gun
And baby when it's love,
if it's not rough it isn't fun

Oh, oh, oh, oh, ohhhh, ohh-oh-e-ohh-oh-oh
I'll get him hot, show him what I've got
(and I) Want you to know
Oh, oh, oh, oh, ohhhh, ohh-oh-e-ohh-oh-oh
I'll get him hot, show him what I've got

Can't read my,
Can't read my
No he can't read my poker face
He's got me like nobody
Can't read my
Can't read my
No he can't read my poker face
She's got me like nobody

P-P-P-Poker face, P-P-Poker face
P-P-P-Poker Face, P-P-Poker face

I won't tell you that I love you
Kiss or hug you
'cause I'm bluffin' with my muffin
I'm not lyin' I'm just stunnin' with my love-glue-gunnin'
Just like a chick in the casino
Take your bank before I pay you out
I promise this, promise this
Check this hand 'cause I'm marvelous

I'm marvelous
I'm marvelous
I'm marvelous
So marvelous

Can't read my,
Can't read my
No he can't read my poker face
