                        Uh yo yo
 It was back in '07 did a couple of tapes
 Did a couple dvds made a couple mistakes
 Didn't know what I was doing but I put on a cape
 Now it's which worlds tour should I go on and take
 See you told me I would lose but I won
 I might cop a million Jimmychoos just for fun
 Cause bitches couldn't take what was in me
 Australia Sydney, Might run up in Disney
 Out in la wit Lindsey,
 Got the eye of the tiger the lion of Judah
 Now it's me and my time it's just me and my prime
 Everything I try to teach them they gonna see it in time
 Tell them bitches get a stick I'm done leading the blind
 Got two shows tonight that's Brooklyn and Dallas
 Then the private party at the Buckingham palace
 Which means I gotta fly like a movie no commercial
 As young money cash money yea I'm universal

 Chorus:
 I hope they coming for me because the top is lonely
 What the *** they gon say oh (2x)
 I'm the best bitch doing it doing it (2x)
 I'm the good good good good
 I'm the best.

 Yo yo yo
 I remember when I couldn't buy my mother a couch
 Now I'm sitting at the closing bought my mother a house
 You can never understand why I grind like I do
 Makiya and Jelani why I grind like I do
 Cause even when my daddy was on crack
 I was crack now the whole album crack
 You ain't even gotta skip a track
 I ain't gotta get a plaque I ain't gotta get awards
 I just walk up out the door
 All the girls will applaud All the girls will commend
 As long as they understand
 That I'm fighting for the girls never thought they can win
 Cause before they could begin you told them it was the end
 But I am here to reverse the curse that they live in
 Got two bones to pick ima only choose one
 You might get addressed on the second album
 Which means you can breathe till I motha***en say so
 To all my bad bitches I could see your halo.

 Chorus:
 I hope they coming for me because the top is lonely
 What the *** they gon say oh (2x)
 I'm the best bitch doing it doing it (2x)
 I'm the good good good good
 I'm the best eh
 It's ok (2x)
 Long as you know (2x)
 Long as you motha***a know
 I'm the b b b b b b b best

 I hope they coming for me cause the top is lonely
 What the gon say (2x)
 I'm the best bitch doing it (2x)
 I'm the best
 I'm the best
                        
                    |
