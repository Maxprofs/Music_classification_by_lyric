                        You shake my nerves and you rattle my brain
Too much love drives a man insane
You broke my will
But what a thrill
Goodness gracious great balls of fire!

I laughed at love cause I thought it was funny
but you came along and moooooved me honey
I've changed my mind 
This love is fine
Goodness gracious great balls of fire! 

Kiss me baby
Mmmm feels good
Hold me baby
Welll I want to love you like a lover should
You're fine, so kind
Got to tell this world that you're mine mine mine mine

I change my knickers and I twiddle my thumbs
I'm real nervous but it sure is fun
C'mon baby, you drive me crazy
Goodness gracious great balls of fire!

(piano solo)

Welll kiss me baby
Mmmm feels good
Hold me baby
Welll I want to love you like a lover should
You're fine, so kind
Got to tell this world that you're mine mine mine mine

I have my nickles and I twiddle my thumbs
I'm real nervous but it sure is fun
C'mon baby, drive me crazy
Goodness gracious great balls of fire!
