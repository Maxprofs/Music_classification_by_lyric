                        Remember the day, our lips touched in the rain
 Fire works through my veins, into my heart
 Remember the nights, dancing under the sky
 I got lost in the moonlight, found in your dark eyes Oh I wanna fall in love again
 but this time, but this time
 with no regrets,
 I wanna give it all again
 but this time, but this time
 with no secrets,
 I don't want just anyone, not anyone new
 I wanna fall in love again with you, with you, with you
 I wanna fall in love again with you, with you. Can we forget all the lies that we've led
 take us so far away from the truth
 can we erase all the tears and regrets
 fear hiding in the pain, the shadows of yesterday. Oh I wanna fall in love again
 but this time, but this time
 with no regrets,
 I wanna give it all again
 but this time, but this time
 with no secrets,
 I don't want just anyone, not anyone new
 I wanna fall in love again, with you, with you, with you We can take a blank white page
 and fill it with the dreams we made
 and let these scars slowly fade away I wanna fall in love again
 but this time with no regrets,
 I wanna give it all again
 but this time, but this time
 with no secrets,
 I don't want just anyone, not anyone new
 Oh I don't want just anyone, not anyone new
 I wanna fall in love again, with you, with you, with you
 I wanna be in love again with you, with you.
 I wanna be in love again.
