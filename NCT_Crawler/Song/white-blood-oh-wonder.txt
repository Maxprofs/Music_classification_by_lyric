                        Bài hát : White Blood - Oh Wonder

[Verse 1]
I'm ready to go, I'm ready to go
Can't do it alone, can't do it alone
I'm ready to run through the heat of the sun
Can't do it alone, can't do it alone
I'm ready to fall, so tired of it all
Down deep in a hole, can't do it alone
I'm ready to climb this mountain inside
Impossible heights

[Chorus]
Said you'd always be my white blood
Circulate the right love
Giving me your white blood
I need you right here with me
Said you'd always be my white blood
Elevate my soul above
Giving me your white blood
I need you right here with me
Here with me
[Verse 2]
I'm ready to go, I’m ready to go
Can't do it alone, can’t do it alone
I’m ready to run through the heat of the sun
Can’t do it alone, can't do it alone
I’m ready to hope, swing me out of the low
Wide awake in the glow, can't do it alone
I’m ready to fly, uncover the light
Impossible heights

[Chorus]
Said you'd always be my white blood
Circulate the right love
Giving me your white blood
I need you right here with me
Said you'd always be my white blood
Elevate my soul above
Giving me your white blood
I need you right here with me
I need you right here with me
Here with me

Said you'd always be my white blood
Circulate the right love
Giving me your white blood
I need you right here with me

Said you'd always be my white blood
Elevate my soul above
Giving me your white blood
I need you right here with me
I need you right here with me
                        
                    |
