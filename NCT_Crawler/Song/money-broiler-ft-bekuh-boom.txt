                        Bài hát: Money - Broiler, Bekuh Boom

I must be the reincarnation
of Mr. Benjadmin Franklin
I got the dumbest brain

But I don't go got a name
Put my outfit on like an ATM
Lookin' like cashflow and it never ends

When it get down imma do it again
I'm the weatherman I make it rain on 'em
Lookin' like I robbed a bank
I look too good for goodness sake
No applies no need a thing

Man I do this everyday
I'm (on black on) Forbes list
They want to endorse this
I'm like well of course bitch

I'm lookin' like money
Lookin' like money
I'm lookin' like money
Lookin like money

(Needs correction): So let's split this money
I'm lookin' like money
Sittin' on cachillions ...
Lookin' this good, bet you don't
I'm lookin' like money
I'm lookin' like money
I make it rain on 'em
I make it rain

Lincoln I'm Lincoln but honey this ain't for free
I'm in Washington talking 'bout paper like want and see
I think I'm a money tree
If you don't dare you can leave
I mean leave, best believe you should invest mo' in me

Racks on racks from my head to my toes
I'm talking stacks on stacks when I walk out the door
Tax on tax if you 'ready want mo'
... you know what

I'm lookin' like money
Lookin' like money
I'm lookin' like money
Lookin' like money
(Needs correction): So let's split this money
I'm lookin' like money
Sittin' on cachillions ...
Lookin' this good, bet you don't
I'm lookin' like money
I'm lookin' like money
Imma Imma Imma Imma do it again
I make it rain
