                        Bài hát: Slowly - Matt Cardle

Saw your face, turned away
Never gave a second thought, never looked at you that way
Searching for, someone else
I didn’t hear the fireworks, we were dancing with ourselves
And then you come close and knock me out, oh

Slowly, slowly, changing me slowly
Driving with your heart, kissing in the dark
The way you hold me, hold me, turn with me slowly
This is where it starts, kissing in the dark

You’re a thorn, in my soul
That cuts at first but now I’m feeling something wonderful
More fool me, to let you drive
You can push me all you want but I’ll fall when I decide
But then you come close and knock me out, oh

Slowly, slowly, changing me slowly
Driving with your heart, kissing in the dark
The way you hold me, hold me, turn with me slowly
This is where it starts, kissing in the dark

It makes me shiver, that I could have missed you
It makes me shiver, that I could have missed you

Slowly, slowly, changing me slowly
Driving with your heart, kissing in the dark
The way you hold me, hold me, turn with me slowly
This is where it starts, kissing in the dark
