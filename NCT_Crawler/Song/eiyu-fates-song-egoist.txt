                        Bài hát: Eiyu Fate's Song - EGOIST

Can you hear them calling out her name
When the light was gone she came
Refused to lose
Stood for the truth
Her story never fades away
Lead us lord of light
All alone I sing for you

Is this love sounding loud enough
And it won’t reach you
Maybe we need to dance with our destiny
Tell me how to make it through
And how I can ever be with you
When the bridges fall
And I still stand small burning with my love
People cry for what is right

Without a fright or fear
Holding their flags much higher
To show it is time to move forward
I’m turning darkness into light
Even if I end my life
Let all the fear surrender here
I’ll be the mistress of the fight
Reaching out to god above
The victory’s in front of us

One for the road before we go
We’re leaving at the crack of dawn
This is our fate
Nothing gold stays forever
We live and die together
Flowers grow and they all fall
Our days are numbered
Wish upon the tragic world

Write lyrics to the singing bird
I love you
And I’ll leave you with this serenade
People cry with madness
Rightness to prove
Holding their flags much higher
To show it is time to set fire
I’m turning darkness into light
Even if I lose my sight
Let all the freedom be with us
I’ll be the mistress of the times

For the sake of happiness
There’s no way stopping us
Burn down the sky before it cries
You’re never coming home again
This is our fate
I can hear a whistle cheering up us to fight
Through it all
I can see a forgot-me-not blooming
So beautiful
To give up who you are

And live without your faith
Is more regrettable than dying
Than dying so young
People have a story
Growing belief
Holding their flags much higher
Try to stay as a true fighter
I’m turning darkness into light
Even if I end my life
I’ll never let you bring me down

I’ll keep myself standing tall now
Reaching out to god above
The victory’s in front of us
One for the road before we go
We’re leaving at the crack of dawn
Can you hear the hero’s song
When it seems our hopes are gone

Let all the freedom be with us
I’ll be the mistress of the times
All the flowers left are dead
The rest of story lies ahead

One for the road before we go
We’ll leave together on our own
This is our fate
