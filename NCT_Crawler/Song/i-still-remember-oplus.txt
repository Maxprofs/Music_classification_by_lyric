                        Bài hát: I Still Remember You - OPlus

Sometimes I remember the time 
When we were together 
So far away from here

We walked along the beach to see 
The sun going down
And the kids playing around

You just called my name
Whispered the sweetest things
And I closed my eyes to feel the love between us
Burning so strong, raising up to the sky

I still remember you 
The day we were apart
The day I made a mistake
A terrible mistake
That made me lose you forever

You, can you hear my heart
It says we still need each other
To live 'till the end of time
Together once again

There are many times I wonder if you ever think of me 
All these memories of us will stay with me until I die
                        
                    |
