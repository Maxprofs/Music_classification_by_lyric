                        Remember me [4x]



Where will we stand?

When all the lights go out

Across this city's streets

Where were you when

All of the ambers fell

I still remember there

Covered in ash

Covered in glass

Covered in all my friends

I still

Think of the bombs they built



If that's the best that I could be?

Than I'd be another memory

Can I be the only hope for you?

Because you're the only hope for me

And if we can find where we belong,

We'll have to make it on our own.

Face all the burn and take it out

Because the only hope for me is you

Alone



How would you be

Many as after the disaster that we've seen

What we have learnt

Of all the people burning

In purifying flame



I say it's okay

I know you can tell

And though you can see me smile

I still

Think of the guns they sell



If that's the best that I could be?

Than I'd be another memory

Can I be the only hope for you?

Because you're the only hope for me

And if we can find where we belong,

We'll have to make it on our own.

Face all the burn and take it out

Because the only hope for me is you

Alone



The only hope for me

The only hope for me is you

The only hope

For me is you

The only hope

For me is you

The only hope

For me is you

The only hope



If that's the best that I could be?

Than I'd be another memory
