                        [Chorus:]
 Yes yes y'all and you don't stop
 1, 2 y'all and you don't stop
 Yes yes y'all and you don't stop
 1, 2 Com-Sense is gonna' drop

 Verse One:

 I met this girl, when I was 10 years old
 And what I loved most, she had so much soul
 She was old school, when I was just a shorty
 Never knew throughout my life she would be there for me
 On the regular, not a church girl, she was secular
 Not about the money, no studs was mic checkin her
 But I respected her, she hit me in the heart
 A few New York niggaz, had did her in the park
 But she was there for me, and I was there for her
 Pull out a chair for her, turn on the air for her
 And just cool out, cool out and listen to her
 Sittin on bone, wishin that I could do her
 Eventually if it was meant to be, then it would be
 Cuz' we related, physically and mentally
 And she was fun then, I'd be geeked when she'd come around
 Slim was fresh jo, when she was underground
 Original, pure untampered and down sister
 Boy I tell ya, I miss her

 [Chorus:]
 Yes yes y'all and you don't stop
 1, 2 y'all and you don't stop
 Yes yes y'all and you don't stop
 1, 2 Com-Sense is gonna' drop

 Verse Two:

 Now periodically I would see
 Ol' girl at the clubs, and at the house parties
 She didn't have a body but she started gettin' thick quick
 Did a couple of videos and became afrocentric
 Out goes the weave, in goes the braids beads medallions
 She was on that tip about, stoppin the violence
 About my people she was teachin me
 But not preachin to me but speakin to me
 In a method that was leisurely, so easily I approached
 She dug my rap, that's how we got close
 But then she broke to the West coast, and that was cool
 Cause around the same time, I went away to school
 And I'm a man of expandin', so why should I stand in her way?
 She probably get her money in L. A.
 And she did stud, she got big pub but what was foul
 She said that the pro-black, was goin out of style
 She said, "Afrocentricity, was of the past."
 So she got into R&B hip-house bass and jazz
 Now black music is black music and it's all good
 I wasn't salty, she was with the boys in the hood
 Cause that was good for her, she was becomin well rounded
 I thought it was dope how she was on that freestyle ***
 Just havin' fun, not worried about anyone
 And you could tell, by how her titties hung

 [Chorus:]
 Yes yes y'all and you don't stop
 1, 2 y'all and you don't stop
 Yes yes y'all and you don't stop
 1, 2 Com-Sense is gonna' drop

 Verse Three:

 I might've failed to mention that the chick was creative
 But once the man got to her, he altered the native
 Told her if she got an image and a gimmick
 That she could make money, and she did it like a dummy
 Now I see her in commercials, she's universal
 She used to only swing it with the inner-city circle
 Now she be in the burbs lookin' rock and dressin' hip
 And on some dumb ***, when she comes to the city
 Talkin about poppin glocks, servin rocks, and hittin switches
 Now she's a gangsta rollin with gangsta bitches
 Always smokin blunts and gettin drunk
 Tellin me sad stories, now she only fucks with the funk
 Stressin how hardcore and real she is
 She was really the realest, before she got into show-biz
 I did her, not just to say that I did it
 But I'm committed, but so many niggaz hit it
 That she's just not the same lettin all these groupies do her
 I see niggaz slammin her, and takin her to the sewer
 But I'ma take her back hopin that the *** stop
 Cause who I'm talkin bout y'all is hip-hop
