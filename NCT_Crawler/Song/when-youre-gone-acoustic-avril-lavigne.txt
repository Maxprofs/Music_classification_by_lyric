                        Bài hát: When You're Gone (Acoustic) - Avril Lavigne

Vers1:
I always needed time on my own.
I never thought I'd..need you there-when I cry.
And the days feel like years,when I'm alone.
And the bed where you lie..is made up on your side.
When you walk away,I count the steps that you take.
Do you see how much..I need you-right now?

Refrain:
When you're gone,the pieces of my heart are missing you.
When you're gone,the face I came to know is missing too.
When you're gone,the words I need to hear-to always get me through the day...
And make it okay...I miss you.

Vers2:
I've never felt this way before.
Everything that I do,reminds me of you.
And the clothes you left,they lie on the floor.
And they smell just like you,I love the things that you do.
When you walk away,I count the steps that you take.
Do you see how much..I need you-right now?

1x Refrain:

We were made for each other,out here forever.
I know we were..!(yeah,yeah).
All I ever wanted was for you to know,everything I do-I give my heart and soul.
I can hardly breathe..I need to feel you here with me..yeah.

1x Refrain:
                        
                    |
