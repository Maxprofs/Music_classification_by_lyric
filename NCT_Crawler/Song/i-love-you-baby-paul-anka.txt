                        Song: I Love You, Baby - Paul Anka

As I walk by the seaside 
As I walk through the grass 
I see little bluebirds 
Making love while I pass 
Bees are hummin' and they're singin' everywhere 
Everyone's in love 

I love you baby, I love you so 
I need you honey, I'll never let you go 
'Cause you're the girl in my heart 
You're the one I adore 
And I-I I love you 
As I walk by the schoolyard 
As I walk by the gate 
I see the weeping willow 
Where we kissed on every date 
And carved in the bark you'll find an arrow and a heart 
And underneath it says 

I love you baby, I love you so 
I need you honey, I'll never let you go 
'Cause you're the girl in my heart 
You're the one I adore 
And I-I I love you 
Instrumental break 
As I walk to the corner 
And I pass the candy store 
I hear the very music 
That I once heard before 
Oh how you held me as the music softly played 
I was so in love 

I love you baby, I love you so 
I need you honey, I'll never let you go 
'Cause you're the girl in my heart 
You're the one I adore 
And I-I I love you 
I I I love you 
I I I love you
                        
                    |
