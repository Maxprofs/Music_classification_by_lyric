                        Bài hát: Bad Reputation - Shawn Mendes

[Verse 1]
She's got a bad reputation
She takes the long way home
All of my friends seen her naked
Or so the story goes
Mistakes we all make them
But they won't let It go
She's got a bad reputation
But I know what they don't know

[Chorus]
And I don't care what they say about you baby
They don't know what you've been through
And trust me, I could be the one to treat you like a lady
Let me see what's underneath, all I need Is you
[Verse 2]
She got a bad reputation
Nobody gets too close
A sight of a soul when it's breakin'
Makin' my heart grow cold
And into the deeper she's sinkin'
I'm beggin' her please don't let go
She's got a bad reputation
But she's all that... all that I want, though

[Chorus]
And I don't care what they say about you baby
They don't know what you've been through
And trust me, I could be the one to treat you like a lady
Let me see what's underneath, all I need Is you

[Bridge]
Nobody knows the way that I know her, said
Nobody knows the way that time has shown us It
Nobody knows the way that I know her, said
She got it bad, she got it bad
Nobody knows the way that I know her, said
Nobody knows the way that time has shown us it
Nobody knows the way that I know her, said
She got it bad, she got it bad

[Chorus]
And I don't care what they say about you baby
They don't know what you've been through
And trust me, I could be the one to treat you like a lady
Let me see what's underneath, all I need Is you
                        
                    |
