                        Bài hát: Cross Your Mind - Sabrina Claudio

[Verse 1]
I'm a mess, I admit it
I'm addicted to anything that's not good for me, mmm
And I'm spending my time thinking, "Who the hell is she in your arms smilin'?"
I know you're afraid of what you want but I've been curious

[Chorus]
Do I ever, do I ever cross your mind?
When you're kissing her
Touching her, staring in her eyes
Tell me, do I ever, do I ever cross your mind?
When you run your hands through her hair like you did to mine
Tell me, do I ever, do I ever cross your mind?

[Post-Chorus]
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Mind, oh, oh, oh

[Verse 2]
Hypocrite, I'll admit it
'Cause it's not like I've been spending my nights alone
But I can't stop wondering if you're there at home
Wakin' up beside her
And does she feel the way I felt under you?

[Chorus]
Do I ever, do I ever cross your mind?
When you're kissing her
Touching her, staring in her eyes
Tell me, do I ever, do I ever cross your mind?
When you run your hands through her hair like you did to mine
Tell me, do I ever, do I ever cross your mind?

[Post-Chorus]
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Mind, oh, oh, oh

[Bridge]
Oh, it's just jealousy that keeps me up at night
When you're runnin' through my mind
I know you feel the same, tell me that I'm right
Do I ever, oh
Do I ever, ever, ever, ever

[Chorus]
Do I ever, do I ever cross your mind?
When you're kissing her
Touching her, staring in her eyes
Tell me, do I ever, do I ever cross your mind?
When you run your hands through her hair like you did to mine
Tell me, do I ever, do I ever cross your mind?

[Post-Chorus]
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Mind, oh, oh, oh
                        
                    |
