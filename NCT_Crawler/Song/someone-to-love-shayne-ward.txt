                        Finally 
She came along 
Broke the spell 
And set me free 
Push aside 
What use to be 
All the broken hearted man that once was me 
I never gave it up 
I always believe 
When shes in my arms i no what i achieve 

So hear my lonelyness 
Im giving up on you 
I dont need you anymore 
Ive found what i been lookin for 
So hear my emptyness 
Ive got no room for you 
Ive finally found what ive been dreamin of 
Someone to love 

Heyyy 
Cos i was lost 
I was down and out 
Untill that day 
I knew what my life was all about 
Still wonder how 
She came my way 
Shes the reason im smiling here today 

So hear my lonelyness 
Im giving up on you 
I dont need you anymore 
Ive found what i been lookin for 
So hear my emptyness 
Ive got no room for you 
Ive finally found what ive been dreamin of 

Someone to love 
To hold 
To be my inspiration 
Someone to touch, to cherise for life 

So hear my lonelyness 
Im giving up on you 
I dont need you anymore 
Ive found what i been lookin for 
So hear my emptyness 
Ive got no room for you 
Ive finally found what ive been dreamin of 
Someone to love 

Someone to love 

Oh baby 

So hear my emptyness 
Ive got no room for you 
Ive finally found what ive been dreamin of 
Ive finally found what ive been dreamin of 
Someone to love 
Someone to love
