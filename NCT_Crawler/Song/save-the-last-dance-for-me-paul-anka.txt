                        You can dance
 Every dance with the guy
 Who gives you the eye
 Let him hold you tight

 You can smile
 Every smile for the man
 Who held your hand
 Beneath the pale moonlight

 But don't forget who's taking you home
 And in whose arms you're gonna be
 So darlin', save the last dance for me

 Ohh, I know that the musics fine like sparkling wine
 Go and have your fun, laugh and sing
 But while we're apart
 Don't give your heart to anyone

 And don't forget who's taking you home
 And in whose arms you're gonna be
 So darlin', save the last dance for me

 Baby, don't you know I love you so
 Can't you feel it when we touch
 I will never never let you go
 I love you, ohh, so much

 You can dance, go and carry on
 Till the night is gone and it's time to go
 If he asks, if you're all alone
 Can he take you home, you must tell him no

 'Cause don't forget who's taking you home
 And in whose arm's you're gonna be
 So darlin', save the last dance for me
                        
                    |
