                        Bài hát : Islands In The Stream - Dolly Parton, Kenny Rogers

Baby when I met you
there was peace unknown
I set out to get you
with a fine tooth comb
I was soft inside
there was somethin' going on

You do something to me
that I can't explain
Hold me closer and I feel no pain
Every beat of my heart
We got somethin' goin on

Tender love is blind
It requires a dedication
All this love we feel
Needs no conversation
We ride it together, ah-ah
Makin' love with each other, ah-ah

(chorus)
Islands in the stream
That is what we are
No one in between
How can we be wrong?
Sail away with me to another world
And we rely on each other, ah-ah
From one lover to another, ah-ah

I can't live without you
if the love was gone
Everything is nothin'
if you got no one
And you did walk in tonight
slowly losing sight of the real thing

But that wont happen to us
and we got no doubt
Too deep in love and
we got no way out
and the message is clear
This could be the year
for the real thing

No more will you cry
Baby I will hurt you never
We start and end as one
in love forever
We can ride it together, ah-ah
Makin' love with each other, ah-ah

(chorus)

Sail away
Oh come sail away with me, with me
                        
                    |
