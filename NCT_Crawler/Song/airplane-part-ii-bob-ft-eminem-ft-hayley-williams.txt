                        Chorus - Hayley Williams]
Can we pretend that airplanes
In the night sky
Are like shooting stars
I could really use a wish right now (wish right now, wish right now)
Can we pretend that airplanes
In the night sky
Are like shooting stars
I could really use a wish right now (wish right now, wish right now)

(Dreamin, Im fallin, Dreamin, Im fallin)

[B.o.B - Verse 1]
Lets pretend like its 98, like Im eating lunch off of Styrofoam treys
Trying to be the next rapper coming out the A
Hoping for a record deal, to re-know my pain
Now lets pretend like Im on the stage
And when my beat drops everybody goes insane (Ok)
And everybody know my name (B.o.B)
And everywhere I go people wanna hear me sang
Oh yea and I just dropped my new album
On the first week I did 500 thousand
Gold in the spring and diamond in the fall
And then a world tour just to top it all off
And lets pretend like they call me the greatest
Selling out arenas with big ass stages
And everybody loved me and no one ever hated
Lets try to use imagination

[Chorus - Hailey Williams]

[B.o.B - Verse 2]
Ok, lets pretend like this never happened
Like I never had dreams of being a rapper
Like I didnt write raps in all of my classes
Like I never used to runaway into the blackness
Now lets pretend like it was all-good
Like I didnt live starring in a notebook
Like I did the things I probably knew I should
But I didnt have neighbours thats why they call it hood
Now lets pretend like I aint got a name
Before they ever called me B.o.B or a.k.a Bobby Ray
Im talking back before the mixtapes
Before the videos and the deals and the fame
Airplanes (Part 2) lyrics on 
http://music.***/song/English/64980-Airplanes~B-o-B-ft-Eminem-Hayley.html
Before they ever once compared me to Andre
Before I ever got Myspace
Before they ever noticed my face
So lets just pretend and make wishes out of airplanes

[Chorus - Hailey Williams]

(And it seems like yesterday it was just a dream, just memories)

[Eminem - Verse 3]
Lets Pretend Marshall Mathers never picked up a pen
Lets pretend things wouldve been no different
Pretend people procrastinated had no motivation
Pretend he just made excuses that was so paper thin they could blow away wit the wind
Marshall you never gone make it, makes no sense to play the game it aint no way thatll you win
Pretend he just stand out side all day and play with his friends
Pretend he even had a friend to say was his friend
And it wasnt time to move in school no changing again
He wasnt socially awakard and just strange as a kid
He had a father and his mother wasnt crazy as sh-t
And he never dreamed he can ripped stadiums he just lazy as *
F-ck a talent show in the gymnasium bitch
You wont amount to sh-t quit day dreaming kid
You need to get ya cranium check you thinking like an alien
It just aint realistic
Now pretend they aint just make him angry with this sh-t
And there was no one he could even aim when hes pissed with
And his alarm went off to wake him but he didnt make it to the rap Olympics
Left to his plane and he missed it
Hes gonna have a hard time explaining to Haley and Laney these food stamps and WIC *
Cause he never risked sh-t he hoped and he wished it
But it didnt fall in his lap so he aint even hear it he pretends that
                        
                    |
