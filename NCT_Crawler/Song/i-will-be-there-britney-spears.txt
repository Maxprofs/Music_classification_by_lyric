                        I will be there _britney spears

Oh yeah 

You don't have to say what's on your mind 
'cause I know where you've been 
give it up and leave it all behind 
and then let me begin 

(Bridge) 
Come on hold my hand 
let me show how friends should be 
I will make it alright... 
let me make it clear 
you can put your trust in me 
yes I will be there... 

(Chorus) 
When you need someone 
you just turn around 
and I will be there 
when you're feeling low 
baby let me know 
and I will be there 

Won't you let me make it up to you... 
now you know where I am 
there ain't nothing that I wouldn't do 
just to love once again 

( Bridge and Chorus) 

Just take a stand 
I'll be here for you 
now and forever 
give one more chance 
just to show you how much I care 
ooohhh I'll be there 

When you need someone 
just turn around 
and I will be there 
when you're in sorrow 
just let me know and I will be there 

(Chorus) 

I'll be there..... 
(I will be there) 

(I will be there) 
I will be there.... 

I will be there
                        
                    |
