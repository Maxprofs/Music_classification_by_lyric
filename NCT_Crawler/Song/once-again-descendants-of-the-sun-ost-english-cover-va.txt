                        Bài hát : Once Again (Descendants Of The Sun OST) (English Cover) - V.A

Chorus:
Let me know if we will ever meet again?
Now I’m standing here alone
And our destiny has passed me by(y)

Isn’t it the dream that we can’t wake up from
You have gone so far away, baby I can’t just say, even once

That I love you
From deep inside my heart
Don’t let me cry

Verse 1:
You came to me like a dream
That disappears if I touch
Like snow that melts
When I miss you
I see myself become you

Didn't hold on to us
Thought you'd return
If I kept longing, I'd be standing with my feverish feelings

The only light in the dark
Just for me, it is you 
No matter how much I ask, I know for sure that it is you
I tried to push you out but
You tried holding on to us
I wrote it wrong in my heart then
Now only you are in my dreams

I don’t wanna lose you
Be without you anymore
(I thought I could move on but I don’t know how to live without you)

I don’t wanna lose you
Be without you anymore


Chorus:
Let me know if we will ever meet again?
Now I’m standing here alone
And our destiny has passed me by(y)

Isn’t it the dream that we can’t wake up from
You have gone so far away, baby I can’t just say, even once

That I love you
From deep inside my heart
Don’t let me cry


Verse 2:
If only I could go back for one day, if I could relive that day
If only I could turn back, retracting all I did that way
If only I hugged you tight, make you less lonely in the night
If only I could go back, turn back the hands of time 

I’d never let you go, I’d keep your hands inside of mine
And I would let you know, I just need you to smile and bloom
So why did I fail you back then, and could I do it again?
Even when it’s me who left you, it will always be you

I don’t wanna lose you
Be without you anymore
(I thought I could move on but I don’t know how to live without you)

I don’t wanna lose you
Be without you anymore

Chorus:
Let me know if we will ever meet again?
Now I’m standing here alone
And our destiny has passed me by(y)

Isn’t it the dream that we can’t wake up from
You have gone so far away, baby I can’t just say, words inside my heart

And all this time I’m still crying
Right here for you I’m still waiting
Till my heart can take no more
Don’t say goodbye
Please come back to me
We'll be together once again...
                        
                    |
