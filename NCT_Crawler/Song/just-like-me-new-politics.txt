                        You say you want to save the world
 (Just Like Me)
 You want to find the perfect girl
 (Just Like Me)
 You want to drive a fancy car
 (Just Like Me)
 You want to be a rock star

 Just like me me me me! You say you're just like me You say you want a lot of money
 (Just Like Me)
 You pretend that life is funny

 You're nothing like me
