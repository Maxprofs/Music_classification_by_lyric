                        Is it really necessary
 Every single day
 Making me more ordinary
 In every possible way

 This ordinary mind is broken
 You did it and you don't even know
 Leaving me with words unspoken
 You better get back cuz I'm ready for...

 More than this
 Whatever it is
 Baby, I hate days like this
 Caught in a trap
 I can't look back
 Baby I hate days like this

 When it rain rain rain rains
 It rain rain rain rains
 When it rain rain rain rains
 It rain rain rain rains...
 More than this
 Baby I hate days like

 Trying to be ordinary
 Was it me who was the fool?
 Thought you found the man you wanted
 Until you turn him into something new

 Well even if our minds are broken
 There's something that I need you to know
 It's nothing like the life we wanted
 You better move on
 Cuz I'm ready for

 More than this
 Whatever it is
 Baby, I hate days like this
 Caught in a trap
 I can't look back
 Baby I hate days like this

 When it rain rain rain rains
 It rain rain rain rains

 More than this
 Baby I hate days like

 (Spoken)
 I'm not angry
 Don't know what to do
 After all the years that I spent with you
 I can't blame you for the things you say
 I was using you just to hide away

 More than this
 Whatever it is
 Baby, I hate days like this
 Caught in a trap
 I can't look back
 Baby I hate days like this

 When it rain rain rain rains
 It rain rain rain rains...
 When it rain rain rain rains
 It rain rain rain rains

 When it rain rain rain rains
 It rain rain rain rains...
 When it rain rain rain rains
 It rain rain rain rains
 More than this
 Baby I hate days like
