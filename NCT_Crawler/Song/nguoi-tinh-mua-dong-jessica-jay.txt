                        Bài hát: Người Tình Mùa Đông - Jessica Jay

In the morning when I wake
I had no more tear the whisper
Oh one little number nine
Were night what to young
How I found to mean the tree
When the face so warm and tender

That's thing never in the dark
Cause deep in my hearted
Now or never still me with forever
Tell me that to never have apart
Body side that's thing the life
That speak like a dry
Like together into never never
Lock to side my guilty
How it's so bad to know
Rose like to find him gone
In the morning when I wake
How I wonder is find to me
That's thing never in the dark
Cause deep in my hearted

In the night to hear his side
In the morning always seeing
That moon silver and the screen
And saw guilty green
Why it's you I'm just the win
When I try I almost kissing

That's thing never in the dark
Cause deep in my hearted
Now or never still me with forever
Tell me that to never have apart
Body side that's thing the life
That speak like a dry
Like together into never never
Lock to side my guilty
How it's so bad to know
Rose like to find him gone
In the morning when I wake
How I wonder is find meeting
That's thing never in the dark
Cause deep in my hearted
Now or never still me with forever
Tell me that to never have apart
Body side that's thing the life
That speak like a dry
Like together into never never
Lock to side my guilty
How it's so bad to know
Rose like to find him gone
In the morning when I wake
How I wonder is find to me
That's thing never in the dark
Cause deep in my hearted

In the morning when I wake
I had no more tear the whisper
Oh one little number nine
Were night what to young
How I found to mean the tree
When the face so warm and tender

That's thing never in the dark
Cause deep in my hearted
Now or never still me with forever
Tell me that to never have apart
Body side that's thing the life
That speak like a dry
Like together into never never
Lock to side my guilty
How it's so bad to know
Rose like to find him gone
In the morning when I wake
How I wonder is find to me
That's thing never in the dark
Cause deep in my hearted

In the night to hear his side
In the morning always seeing
That moon silver and the screen
And saw guilty green
Why it's you I'm just the win
When I try I almost kissing

That's thing never in the dark
Cause deep in my hearted
