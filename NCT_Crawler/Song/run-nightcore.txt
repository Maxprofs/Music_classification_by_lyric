                        Bài hát: Run - Nightcore

You might not want to jog on this one 
Get hit on wait for the summer 
You already hot, I'm already hot 
No sweat no under armor 
Louboutin spikes, or your good Nikes 
Hollaback if you need a sponsor 
Yeah he Aight the Mr. Alright 
Come around with a few more comers 
Come on girl you ain't got to talk rose petals 
See me with lil mama can I make you jealous 
Yea it'd be an honor I got to say you special 
Beat it like a drummer girl you better be careful 
Comprende? what's a bentley? 
Like Fredric I'll be gently 
Callin' on you this moment this instant 
What I do is just basic instinct 

You see me all over her, You want me all over you 
Soon as I get rid of her tell me what you gonna do 

I wanna run to you 
I wanna, I wanna ah 
I wanna run to you 
I wanna, I wanna ah 
I wanna get you alone so we can do something wrong 
I wanna run to you oh oh 
(run, run, run, run) 

Head start you got that shorty? 
On your marks til the shots get started 
Can you love it on the rocks Bacardi? 
Relay catch an after party 
Got the bottles and batons get naughty 
Full speed hurry up with your body 
Track meet the course Ferrari 
Need a freak, of course I'm sorry 
You ain't get the memo 
Been made em get low 
See the finish line look a lot like limbo 
Ya we goin in all night like dimples 
Does another bad chick make life more simple 
Ms. Brenna, no beginner, first place tryin' to make you winner 
Ya baby, my Brenda, I'll be waitin in the spot ..... 

You see me all over her, You want me all over you 
Soon as I get rid of her tell me what you gonna do 

I wanna run to you 
I wanna, I wanna ah 
I wanna run to you 
I wanna, I wanna ah 
I wanna get you alone so we can do something wrong 
I wanna run to you oh oh 
(run, run, run, run) 

Yo, we in the spot, the club is hot 
And if you want to party rock say hell yeah (hell yeah) 
Nightcore_Run lyrics on *** 
Non-stop the bottles pop 
And if you want another shot say hell yeah (hell yeah) 
Yo, I'm gonna run to you 
so you could have a little bit of fun with Foo 
I know what you wanna do 
When I wiggle wiggle wiggle in my underroos 
Got you wet, pimpin like Soul Glo 
Never should have let you bounce on my pogo 
Now you wanna be my Yoko Ono 
Slow your roll stop acting like you don't know 
I'm running through these holes like draino 
but I keep it low pro cuz she's my main ho 
I got your tickets there on fandango 
Back row, no fro I'll be eating a mango. 

I wanna run to you 
I wanna, I wanna ah 
I wanna run to you 
I wanna, I wanna ah 
I wanna get you alone so we can do something wrong 
I wanna run to you oh oh 

I wanna run to you 
I wanna, I wanna ah 
I wanna run to you 
I wanna, I wanna ah 
I wanna get you alone so we can do something wrong 
I wanna run to you oh oh
