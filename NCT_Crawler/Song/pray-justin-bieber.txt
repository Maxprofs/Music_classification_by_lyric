                        Song: Pray - Justin Bieber

I just can’t sleep tonight
knowing the things ain’t right
It’s in the papers, it’s on the tv
It’s everywhere that I go
Children are crying
Soldiers are dying
Some people don’t have a home

I know there's sunshine beyond that rain,
I know there's good times beyond that pain
Heaven, tell me I can make a change

I close my eyes, and I can see a better day
I close my eyes, and pray
I close my eyes and I could see a better day
I close my eyes, and pray

I lose my appetite
No way could start tonight
Am I a sinner?
Cause of my dinner still laying on my plate
I got a vision, to make a difference
And I start it today

Cause I know there’s sunshine behind that rain
I know there’s good times behind that pain
Can you tell me how I can make a change?

I close my eyes, and I can see a better day
I close my eyes, and pray
I close my eyes and I could see a better day
I close my eyes, and ..

I pray for the broken hearted
I pray for the life not started
I pray for all amongst not breathing
I pray for all the souls in needing,
Pray, can you give ‘em one a day

I just can’t sleep tonight
Can someone tell me how to make a change

I close my eyes, and I can see a better day
I close my eyes, and pray
I close my eyes and I could see a better day
I close my eyes, and, I pray...
