You're my angel
You're the only sunshine in my life
Feels like heaven when you take me in your arms
You're my angel,
You're the only sunshine in my life
Feels like heaven when you take me in your arms
You're my angel,
You're the only sunshine in my life
Feels like heaven when you take me in your arms
You're my angel,
You're the only sunshine in my life
Feels like heaven when you take me in your arms
My life, my life, my life, my sunshine in my life,
My life, my life, my life, my life, my life, my sunshine in my life,
My life, my life, my life, my life, my life, my sunshine in my life,
My life, my life, my life, my life, my life, my sunshine in my life,
You're my angel,
You're the only sunshine in my life,
Feels like heaven when you take me in your arms
You're my angel,
You're the only sunshine in my life
Feels like heaven when you take me in your arms
You're my angel (angel)
You're my angel,
You're the only sunshine in my life
Feels like heaven when you take me in your arms
You're my angel,
You're the only sunshine in my life
Feels like heaven when you take me in your arms
