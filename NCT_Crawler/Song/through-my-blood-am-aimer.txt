                        Bài hát: Through My Blood (Am) - Aimer

Am I still in the glum nightmare?
Or am I mere stoned?
Tiny bit of reason still remains in my right hand
That power of ache will just keep me alive

Can’t touch nothing ’bout the world
But the truth nothing almost has revealed
Then smash out the future told
It’s time to end these miseries
Latch off my vegus nerve
What color is my blood...Red, black or white?
Now I’m getting ready
Oh, where are my frenemies?

If I got to lose control
Will you kill me first?
Deep rooted anger still remains in my right hand
That power of ache will just keep me alive

Can’t touch nothing ’bout the world
But the truth nothing almost has revealed
Then smash out the future told
It’s time to end these miseries
Latch off my vegus nerve
What color is my blood...Red, black or white?
Now I’m getting ready
Oh, where are my frenemies?

Have I gone so mad?
The pain’s through my blood

Can’t touch nothing ’bout the world
But the truth nothing almost has revealed
Then smash out the future told
It’s time to end these miseries
Latch off my vegus nerve
What color is my blood...Red, black or white?
Now I’m getting ready
Oh, where are my frenemies?

Have I gone so mad?
The pain’s through my blood
                        
                    |
