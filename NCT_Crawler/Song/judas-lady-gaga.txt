                        Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,
I'm in love with Juda-as, Juda-as

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, 
I'm in love with Juda-as, Juda-as

Judas! Juda-a-a! Judas! Juda-a-a!
Judas! Juda-a-a! Judas! GA-GA! (2x)

[Verse 1]
When he comes to me, I am ready
I wash his feet with my hair if he needs
Forgive him when his tongue lies through his brain
Even after three times he betrays me

Ahh ah ah ah ah Ahh ah ah ah
I'll bring him down, bring him down, down
Ahh ah ah ah ah Ahh ah ah ah
A king with no crown, king with no crown

[Chorus]
I'm just a Holy Fool, oh baby, it's so cruel
But I'm still in love with Judas, baby!
I'm just a Holy Fool, oh baby, it's so cruel
But I'm still in love with Judas, baby!

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,
I'm in love with Juda-as, Juda-as

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,
I'm in love with Juda-as, Juda-as

Judas! Juda-a-a! Judas! Juda-a-a!
Judas! Juda-a-a! Judas! GA-GA!

[Verse 2]
I couldn't love a man so purely
Even prophets forgave his crooked way
I've learned love is like a brick, you can 
Build a house or sink a dead body

Ahh ah ah ah ah Ah ah ah ah 
I'll bring him down, bring him down, down
Ahh ah ah ah ah Ah ah ah ah
A king with no crown, king with no crown

[Chorus]
I'm just a Holy Fool, oh baby, it's so cruel
But I'm still in love with Judas, baby
I'm just a Holy Fool, oh baby, it's so cruel
But I'm still in love with Judas, baby

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,
I'm in love with Juda-as, Juda-as

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,
I'm in love with Juda-as, Juda-as

(Ew)

[Bridge]
In the most Biblical sense, 
I am beyond repentance
Fame hooker, prostitute, wench; vomits her mind.
But in the cultural sense,
I just speak in future tense.
Judas, kiss me, if offensed, 
Or wear A condom next time.

I wanna love you, 
But something's pulling me away from you
Jesus is my Virtue 
And Judas is the demon I cling to 
I cling to

[Chorus]
i'm Just a Holy Fool, oh baby, it's so cruel
But I'm still in love with Judas, baby
I'm just a Holy Fool, oh baby, it's so cruel
But I'm still in love with Judas, baby

whOh, oh, oh, oh, oh,
I'm in love with Juda-a-as, Juda-as 

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,
I'm in love with Juda-as, Juda-as

Judas! Juda-a-as! Judas! Juda-a-as!
Judas! Juda-a-as! Judas! GAGA.
