                        Bài hát: See You Again (Piano Cover) - V.A

It's been a long day without you my friend
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
We've come a long way from where we began
Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
When I see you again

Why'd you have to leave so soon?
Why'd you have to go?
Why'd you have to leave me when I needed you the most?

'Cause I don't really know how to tell you
Without feeling much worse
I know you're in a better place
But it's always gonna hurt

Carry on
Give me all the strength I need to carry on

It's been a long day without you my friend
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
We've come a long way from where we began
Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
When I see you again

How do I breathe without you
I'm feeling so cold
I'll be waiting right here for you 
Till the day you're home

Carry on
Give me all the strength I need to carry on

So let the light guide your way
Hold every memory as you go
And every road you take will always lead you home

It's been a long day without you my friend
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
We've come a long way from where we began
Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
When I see you again
                        
                    |
