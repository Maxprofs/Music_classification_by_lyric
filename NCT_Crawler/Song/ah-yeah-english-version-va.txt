Song: Ah yeah (English)
Singer: JANNY

Where do you live? Do you live alone?
Where do you live? Do you live alone?

Ah Yeah Ah Yeah Ah Yeah Ah Yeah Ah Yeah
Ah Yeah Ah Yeah Ah Yeah Ah Yeah Ah Yeah

Why don’t you understand anything I do?
Why should I even bother to explain it to you?
Stop it stop it, why can’t you stop bugging me,
I don’t really care about anything you say,
Man, don’t do that,
I will never answer you, go away, no way.

How many times have you asked me this today?
Baby stop, ah~
Don’t get anything you have to say.
You attempt to win and get me back although
My heart won’t give in so you better go,
All I want is for you to go go away,
Everyone but you understands this signal.

Don’t take all day, hurry up k?
Come here quickly?
Waiting for you, waiting for you now.
Ah Yeah Ah Yeah Ah Yeah Ah Yeah

It’s nothing I’m enjoying,
Getting too annoying,
So give up you’ll never ever win my heart.
Super unappealing,
Messing up my feelings,
Put an end to this game you wanna play, now~

Ah Yeah Ah Yeah Ah Yeah Ah Yeah Ah Yeah
Ah Yeah Ah Yeah Ah Yeah Ah Yeah Ah Yeah

Why are stuttering right now?
Did the cat get your tongue seems like you’re in need of help.
Nonsense you say sounds like dadumdadum,
Everything is a mess just like barumbarum
From head to shoulder to your knees and your toes, 
Predicting everything is not really hard.

Why do you have so many questions to ask?
Like a child, that’s what you are.
What is it you really have to know?

Please stop putting on a show,
Telling you to leave so you better go.
Trying to get me back thinking you’re such a pro,
You mean nothing don’t you know? 

Don’t take all day, hurry up k?
Come here quickly?
Waiting for you, waiting for you now.
Ah Yeah Ah Yeah Ah Yeah Ah Yeah

It’s nothing I’m enjoying,
Getting too annoying,
So give up you’ll never ever win my heart.
Super unappealing,
Messing up my feelings,
Put an end to this game you wanna play, now~

All the things you have never said,
Yeah, but I know they won’t be true.
(Ah) Now I’m giving you a chance,
(Yeah) Time’s up, you’re a bit too late.
Please get out of my world, now~

Where do you live? Do you live alone?
Where do you live? Do you live alone?

(Ah yeah~) 
It’s nothing I’m enjoying,
Getting too annoying,
So give up you’ll never ever win my heart. (Ever win my heart)
Super unappealing,
Messing up my feelings,
Put an end to this game you wanna play, now~

Ah Yeah Ah Yeah Ah Yeah Ah Yeah Ah Yeah
Ah Yeah Ah Yeah Ah Yeah Ah Yeah Ah Yeah
Ah Yeah Ah Yeah Ah Yeah Ah Yeah Ah Yeah
Ah Yeah Ah Yeah Ah Yeah Ah Yeah Ah Yeah
