                        Mr. Telephone Man, there's something wrong with my line
 When I dial my baby's number, I get a click everytime
 Mr. Telephone Man, there's something wrong with my line
 When I dial my baby's number, I get a click every time When I dial 611, computer service
 She said, "Hello, may I help you, please?"
 I told her something must be wrong with my phone
 'Cause my baby wouldn't hang up on me Mr. Telephone Man, there's something wrong with my line
 When I dial my baby's number, I get a click everytime
 Mr. Telephone Man, there's something wrong with my line
 When I dial my baby's number, I get a click every time She let the phone ring 20 times before she answered
 Let me tell you what happened then
 A minute later I got the operator saying, "Please hang up
 And place your call again", baby Mr. Telephone Man, there's something wrong with my line
 When I dial my baby's number, I get a click everytime
 Mr. Telephone Man, something's wrong with my line
 I try to dial her number, but I get a click everytime Some strange man is on the telephone
 He keeps telling me, my baby ain't home
 She ain't got no party line, the situation's blowing my mind
 Oh, I just can't take this anymore Please operator, see what you can do
 I dialed the right number but I still couldn't get through
 Could you just check the line just one more time if you can
 I'm pretty sure her phone wouldn't be answered by no man Mr. Telephone Man, there's something wrong with my line
 When I dial my baby's number, I get a click everytime
 Mr. Telephone Man, something's wrong with my line
 I try to dial her number, but I get a click everytime Must be a bad connection, I give her my love and affection
 I just can't take this no more
 This situation's blowing my mind
 Can't get my baby on the line I tried dialing information, Mr. Telephone Man
 I can't get no coperation, Mr. Telephone Man
 Her sister's on the phone telling me my baby ain't at home
 Come on, baby, I just can't take it anymore Help me out
 Please, Mr. Telephone Man
 Help me out
 Please, Mr. Telephone Man
