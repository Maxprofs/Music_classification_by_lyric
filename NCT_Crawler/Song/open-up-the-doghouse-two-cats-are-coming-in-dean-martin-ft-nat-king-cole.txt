 Open up the doghouse
 Rover, Rover, move it over
 Two cats are comin' in Nat, you look like a man with a story , I sure have
 I told my wife we oughta save money
 That's the way it's gotta be, oh gotta, gotta be that way
 She cancelled all her charge accounts, gave all the gold to me Well, I can't see what you did wrong
 Why was your woman so upset?
 Well, I put the money on a horse
 And he hasn't showed up yet Open up the doghouse
 Open up the doghouse
 Rover, Rover, move it over
 Two cats are comin' in Well, Dean, what's your problem? Here it is
 I gave my wife a beautiful fur coat, you did?
 Told her it was genuine mink, rich man I took her out to show it off
 Then we stopped in for a drink, oh cocktails
 Well, I know your wife was really thrilled
 How come you two had a spat? Oh, it's easy, you see
 It started to rain, the coat got wet
 And mink just don't smell like that
 Timber Open up the doghouse
 Open up the doghouse
 Rover, Rover, move it over
 Two cats are comin' in Let's hear it, Nat, you know what
 You know what though
 What?
 There's just one way to handle a woman Dean, we just got to treat 'em rough
 We gotta slap 'em, that's right
 We gotta show 'em who wears the pants
 Cut out that sissy, sissy stuff Now it ain't no use to take abuse
 Whenever they are cranky or cross
 Let's put the women in their place
 And we'll show them who's the boss Open up the doghouse
 Two cats are comin' in
