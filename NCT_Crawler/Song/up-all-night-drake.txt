Kush rolled, glass full, I prefer the better things
Niggas with no money act like money isn't everything
I'm havin a good time, they just tryin to ruin it
Shout out to the fact that I'm the youngest nigga doin' it
Cap on, brim bent, Denzel every time
She ain't tryin' to pop that *** for Pitbull? 'K, well never mind
I-I tried to told you Drizzy still ain't nothing nice
Bracelet sayin' "You should quit"
Car sayin' "*** your life"
Okay, now we out of here, toodles to you bitches
And if you dolled up I got the voodoo for you bitches
Yeah, I'm busy gettin' rich, I don't want trouble
I made enough for two niggas, boy, stunt double
Famous like a drug that I've taken too much of
But I never ever trip just peace, happiness and love
I got money in these jeans so they fit me kinda snug
Plus the game is in my pocket, nigga, this is what I does

I'm about whatever, mayne

*** what they be talkin' 'bout

They opinion doesn't count

We the only thing that matters, awwwww

So we do it how we do it

All up in ya face, man I hate to put you through it

I be up all night, whole crew's in here

Cuz I don't really know who I'mma lose this year

Awwww, man I love my team

Man I love my team, I would die for them niggas, awwww
Yo, if Drizzy say get her, I'mma get her
I got the kind of money make a broke bitch bitter
I got that kinda... wait, wait, fixate
Which bitch you know made a million off a mix tape?
That was just a keepsake
Bought the Presidential, Louis Presidential briefcase
Never been a cheapskate
We got the hawks, I ain't talkin about the peach state
Man, for Pete's sake, scratch that, sweepstakes
(ahahahaha) *** I look like, ho?
I look like yes and you look like no
I'm a bad bitch I ain't never been a mixed breed
On a diet but I'm doing donuts on a six speed
M6 in front of Em too
I see a lot of rap bitches on the menu
But I collect a hundred thou at the venue
And pop bottles with my team, Young Money til the death of me
I mean we can't even run through the streets if it don't got a comma on the price tag
I, I mean, but then again, who looks at the price tags?

Oh yeah we in this bitch
