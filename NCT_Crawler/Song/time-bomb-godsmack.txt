                        I am in a living hell,
 makes me wonder if
 I'm alive Can't seem to
 bring myself to figure
 out why And I shove,
 and I pull away
 To the things that I
 call you every day I can't
 seem to break you
 down But I know
 I'll come
 around
 I
 feel your pins
 Through my eyes
 Piercing me
 Lie down in all this piss
 You drink it
 from me every day
 I live in a world of
 *** Been left here to
 dieSometimes I
 realize My mind
 was meant to
 go away Never have
 I seen your God
 So why should
 I believe in faith?I
 feel your pins
 Through my eyes
 Piercing me through
 the timeAnother
 time bombI
 am in a living hell,
 makes me wonder if I'm alive
 Can't seem to bring myself
 to figure out why And I
 shove, and I pull away
 To the things that I call you
 every night I can't
 seem to break you down But I
 know I'll come aroundI feel your pins
 Through my eyes
 Piercing me through the
 timeI never find the time
 to find another fuckin'
 place I'm a bad motherfucker
 who lives it every day
 You never look at me now
 You never look me in the face
 I'm a time bomb, time
 bomb, babyI can't find
 the time to find a place I'm a
 bad motherfucker who lives it
 every day You never
 look at me now, you never
 look me in the face
 I'm a time bomb, time
 bomb, yeah
 What am I
 waiting for?I
 never find the time to find another
 fuckin' place I'm a bad
 motherfucker who
 lives it
 every day
 You never look at me now,
 you never look me in the face
 I'm a time bomb,
 yeahTime bomb Time bomb,
 time bomb Time bomb,
 time bomb
