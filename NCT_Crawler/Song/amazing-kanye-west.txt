It's amazing
I'm the reason
Everybody fired up this evening

I'm exhausted
Barely breathing
Holding on to what I believe in

No matter what
You'll never take that from me
My reign is as far as your eyes can see

It's amazing, so amazing, so amazing, so amazing, it's amazing
so amazing, so amazing, so amazing, it's amazing (Let's go)

I'm a monster
I'm a killer
I know I'm wrong, yeah

I'm a problem
That I never
Ever resolved

And no matter what
You'll never take that from me
My reign is as far as your eyes can see

It's amazing, so amazing, so amazing, so amazing, it's amazing
so amazing, so amazing, so amazing, it's amazing (Let's go)

I'm a monster
I'm a maven
I know this world is changing

Never gave in
Never gave up
I'm the only thing I'm afraid of

No matter what
You'll never take that from me
My reign is as far as your eyes can see

It's amazing, so amazing, so amazing, so amazing,
It's amazing so amazing, so amazing, so amazing, it's amazing.

so amazing, so amazing, so amazing, it's amazing
so amazing, so amazing, so amazing, it's amazing

I'm amazing
Yeah I'm all that
If i ain't on my grind
Then what you call that

Victorious
Yeah we warriors
We make history
Strive of Victory

Standing at my podium
I'm trying watch my sodium
Die high blood pressure
You even let the feds get cha!

I'm amazing
Born on the full moon
I was bred to get in
No spoon

That's why I'm so goose
Summer time, no juice
Big family, small house no rooms

They like oh god!
why you go so hard?
Look what he's been through
He deserves an applause

so amazing, so amazing, so amazing, it's amazing
so amazing, so amazing, so amazing, it's amazing
so amazing, so amazing, so amazing, it's amazing
so amazing, so amazing, so amazing, it's amazing
