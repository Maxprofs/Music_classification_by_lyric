                        Bài hát: Midnight Moon - Oh Wonder

You with the wide eyes, don't lose your courage
You swing your head high and don't be worried
Your heart's in a free ride, feel it beating
Caught in the headlights, climb to the ceiling
We're all animals out in the dark
Got a feeling that we're all believing in
Not waiting for daylight to start
We're over the moon, over the midnight moon
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Over the moon, over the midnight moon
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Over the moon, over the midnight moon
We're over the moon, over the midnight moon
You with the sad smile, don't lose your courage
Dance in the high tide and don't be worried
Your soul's in a wild fire, feel it beating
Dreams on a gold wire, won't you believe it?
We're all animals out in the dark
Got a feeling that we're all believing in
Not waiting for daylight to start
We're over the moon, over the midnight moon
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Over the moon, over the midnight moon
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Over the moon, over the midnight moon
We're over the moon, over the midnight moon
We are going over, we are going over and over
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Over the moon, over the midnight moon
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Over the moon, over the midnight moon
