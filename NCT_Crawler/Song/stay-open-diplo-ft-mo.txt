                        Bài hát: Stay Open - Diplo, MO

[Verse 1]
Even in the darkest hour
You don't have to search so hard
You're the one that holds the power
Now's the time to play your part
If you could see your true colors, you wouldn't have to try so hard
Hiding under all these covers, we all work the way we are

[Chorus]
It's the same with me and you and everybody
Hold on tight our breath while waiting for the party
So many doors, so many closed to us
Oh, baby, my heart's open
You know that I stay open
Pass down the line, standing outside the club
Oh, baby, my heart's open
You know that I stay open for you

[Verse 2]
Baby, I can read the stars
And I see how they shine for you
Don't give yourself up in the darkness
So many better things to do
Wish you could see your true colours
Don't be afraid to play your cards
The skies over you should follow
We all work the way we are

[Chorus]
It's the same with me and you and everybody
Hold on tight our breath while waiting for the party
So many doors, so many closed to us
Oh, baby, my heart's open
You know that I stay open
Pass down the line, standing outside the club
Oh, baby, my heart's open
You know that I stay open for you

You know, you know
Oh, you know, you know
Open for you

[Bridge]
It's the same with me and you and everybody
Hold on tight our breath while waiting for the party
It's the same with me and you and everybody
Hold on tight our breath while waiting for the party

[Chorus]
So many doors, so many closed to us
Oh, baby, my heart's open
You know that I stay open
Pass down the line, standing outside the club
Oh, baby, my heart's open
You know that I stay open for you
                        
                    |
