                        Title: Save Water, Drink Beer
Artist: Chris Young 


It ain't rained in four months
One cigarette spark will burn the whole town up
That ole well is plum dry
The city put a limit on the water you can buy
We don't mind cause 'round here
We save water and drink beer

Ice cold, genuine, raise 'em up, drip 'em dry
Holler and swaller y'all
Support your local wildlife
Do your part around here
Save water, drink beer

We're goin' green, hey look at us
We're maybe even doin' just a little too much
Poppin' tops, gettin' tans
And that's the price we'll pay 'til the long drought ends
We help the world around here
We save water and drink beer

Ice cold, genuine, raise 'em up, drip 'em dry
Holler and swaller y'all
Support your local wildlife
Do your part around here
Save water, drink beer

Drink beer!

Bottoms here
Let's start tonight
Plant a seed and tell a friend
And I think I could drink a little

Ice cold, genuine, raise 'em up, drip 'em dry
Holler and swaller y'all
Support your local wildlife
Do your part around here
We save water and drink beer
Say it loud and say it clear
Save water and drink beer
Hey Yeah, drink beer
