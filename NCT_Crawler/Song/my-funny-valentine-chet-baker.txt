                        Song :My Funny Valentines - Chet Baker 

My funny valentinesweet comic valentine
You make me smile with my heart
Your lips are laughable Unphotographable 
Yet you're my favoring work of art

Is your figure less than GreekIs your mouth a little weak
When you open it to speak are you smart
But don't you change a hair for me
Not if you care for me stay little valentine stay
Each day is valentine's day
