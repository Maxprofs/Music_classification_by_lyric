                        Bài hát: Save Me - Shayne Ward

I never wanna lose you
These are the words you said
I will never hurt you
But look what you`ve done instead
You promised me forever
But still i wake up alone
I see you when my eyes are closed
But when i open them, you are gone
I still believe [i still believe], yeah
What you said to me
That you wouldn`t leave
Now who is gonna save me if you can`t

If you can`t hear me now
[Who`s gonna save me]
If you can`t see me now
[Who`s gonna show me]
I wanna feel you but i can`t get through
I`m crazy enough to still depend on you
So who`s gonna save me now

I don`t wanna walk alone
And i don`t turn off the lights at night
Everything i do is wrong
Baby i need you to make things right
I still believe [i still believe], yeah
What you said to me
That you wouldn`t ever leave
Now who is gonna save me if you can`t

If you can`t hear me now
[Who`s gonna save me]
If you can`t see me now
[Who`s gonna show me]
I wanna feel you but i can`t get through
I`m crazy enough to still depend on you
So who`s gonna save me now
But you
