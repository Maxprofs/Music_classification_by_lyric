                        Bài hát: Feelin' So Good - Jennifer Lopez, Big Pun, Fat Joe

When I opened up my eyes today
Felt the sun shining on my face
It became so clear to me that everything is goin' my way
I feel like there's no limit to what I can see
Got rid of fears that were holding me
My endless possibilities
Has the whole world opened up for me
That's why I'm feeling
Chorus :
I'm feeling so good
I knew I would been taking care of myself like I should
Cause not one thing can bring me down
Nothing in this world gonna turn me around
Now that day is turning into night
And everything is still going right
There's no way you can stop me this time or break this spirit of mine
Like the stars above I'm gonna shine
Anything I want will be mine
Tonight I'm gonna have a good time
Call a few friends of mine
Cause I'm loving life
And tonight's for feeling
[Chorus] x 2
[Rap]
[Chorus] x 2
I'm feeling so
Party on tonight night
Everything is feeling right dj
Party on tonight
Everything is feeling right
[Chorus] x 4
                        
                    |
