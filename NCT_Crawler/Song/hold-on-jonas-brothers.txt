We don’t have time left to regret
(hold on)
It will take more than common sense
(hold on)
So stop your wondering take a stand
(hold on)
Cause there’s more to life than just to live
(hold on)
Cause an empty room
Can be so loud
There's too many tears
To drown them out
So hold on
(hold on)
Hold on
(hold on)
One single smile, a helping hand
(hold on)
It’s not that hard to be a friend
(hold on)
So don’t give up, stand till the end
(hold on)
Cause there’s more to life than just to live
(hold on)
Cause an empty room
Can be so loud
There's too many tears
To drown them out
So hold on
(hold on)
Hold on
(hold on)
When you love someone
And they break your heart
Don’t give up on love
Have faith, restart
Just hold on
(hold on)
Hold on
(hold on)
When it falls apart
And you’re feeling lost
All your hope is gone
Don't forget to
Hold on
Hold on
Cause an empty room
Can be so loud
There's too many tears
To drown them out
So hold on
(hold on)
Hold on
Hold on
(hold on)
(hold on)
When you love someone
When you love some one
And they break your heart
And they break your heart
Don’t give up on love
Don’t give up on love
Have faith, restart
Have faith, restart
Just hold on
Just hold on
(hold on)
(hold on)
Hold on
Hold on
(hold on)
(hold on)
Cause an empty room
Can be so loud
There's too many tears
To drown them out
So hold on
(hold on)
