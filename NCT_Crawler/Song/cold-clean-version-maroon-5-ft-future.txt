                        Bài hát: Cold (Clean Version) - Maroon 5, Future

[Adam Levine] 
Cold enough to chill my bones 
It feels like I don't know you anymore 
I don't understand why you're so cold to me 
With every breath you breathe 
I see there's something going on 
I don't understand why you're so cold 

[Adam Levine] 
Are we taking time or a time out? 
I can't take the in between 
Asking me for space here in my house 
You know how to *** with me 
Acting like we're not together 
After everything that we've been through 
Sleeping up under the covers, 
How am I so far away from you? 
Distant when we're kissing 
Feel so different 
Baby, tell me how did you get so 

[Adam Levine] 
Cold enough to chill my bones 
It feels like I don't know you anymore 
I don't understand why you're so cold to me 
With every breath you breathe 
I see there's something going on 
I don't understand why you're so cold, yeah 
Woah yeah, woah yeah 
I don't understand why you're so cold 

[Adam Levine] 
What you holdin' on, holdin' on for? 
If you wanna leave just leave 
Why you wanna bite your tongue for? 
This silence is killing me 
Acting like we're not together 
If you don't want this, then what's the use? 
Sleeping up under the covers, 
How am I so far away from you? 
Distant (uh) when we're kissing (yeah) 
Feel so different (yeah) 
Baby, tell me how did you get so 

[Adam Levine] 
Cold enough to chill my bones 
It feels like I don't know you anymore 
I don't understand why you're so cold to me 
With every breath you breathe 
I see there's something going on 
I don't understand why you're so cold, yeah 

[Adam Levine & Future] 
Woah yeah, woah yeah 
I don't understand why you're so cold, yeah 
So cold it's colder, woah yeah 
So cold it's colder, woah yeah 
So cold it's colder, 
I don't understand why you're so cold 

[Verse: Future] 
Never thought that you were like this 
I took the tag off of major prices 
I just spent half a mill' on a chandelier 
Now you tryina cut me off like a light switch, yeah 
Trying to stay and I leave 
Saying that you need some time to breathe 
Thinking that I'm sleeping on the four letter word, 
but the four letter word don't sleep 
We goin' two separate ways 
You and me ain't been the same 
You gotta go, but the way your ass used to be 
You gold dig every day 
I spend the hear what you say 
Girl, I tried to give you space 

[Adam Levine] 
Baby, tell me how did you get so cold enough to chill my bones 
It feels like I don't know you anymore 
I don't understand why you're so cold to me 
With every breath you breathe 
I see there's something going on 
I don't understand why you're so cold 

[Adam Levine & Future] 
So cold it's colder, woah yeah 
So cold it's colder, woah yeah 
So cold it's colder 
I don't understand why you're so cold, yeah 
So cold it's colder, woah yeah 
So cold it's colder, woah yeah 
So cold it's colder 
I don't understand why you're so cold
