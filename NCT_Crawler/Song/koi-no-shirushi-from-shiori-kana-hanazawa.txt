                        Bài hát: Koi No Shirushi From Shiori - Kana Hanazawa

KOI NO SHIRUSHI kimi no me ni mitsuketa no ano hi 
Kidzuita toki mune no jishaku mawari dashita 
Sagashite ita tokimeki ni yatto deaetta no 
doko ni itemo mitsukedasu yo mou nidoto mayowanai

The sign of love: I found it in it your eyes that day 
When I realized it, the compass in my heart started to spin 
I finally found the excitement I'd been looking for 
No matter where you are, I will find you, and I'll never be lost again

Kitto futari wa unmei da yo nan'oku mo no hito ga ite 
Deau no wa KOMPYUUTA demo muri 
Heibon sugiru mainichi ni PIRIODO wo utta no 
tameiki sotsugyou dekiru no yatto

We must be destined to be together, if we managed to find each other 
Out of billions of people, it seems impossible, even online 
The monotonous days of my old life are all over now 
I can finally move on from my sighing

Aozora ga mabushii kimi ga iru fuukei wa 
Shiawase no OORA afuredasu no tomaranai yo 
Eki mae no funsui niji wo tsukutte iru yo 
Kimi wo matsu jikan sae mo kakegaenai PURESHASU na toki

The scene you're in with a brilliant blue sky 
Overflows with an aura of happiness that never ends 
The fountain in front of the station is creating a rainbow 
Even the time I spend waiting for you is irreplacable and precious

KOI NO SHIRUSHI watashi ni mo mitsukete kureta ne 
Onaji kimochi onaji kakera wakeatteru 
Haguresou na toki datte daijoubu dayo ne? 
Doko ni itemo mitsukedashite sou watashi koko ni iru

The sign of love: You found it in me too 
We share the same feelings and the same memories 
In the times you feel lost, are you still okay? 
No matter where you are, go out to find me, because I'm right here

Te wo tsunaidara mirai no DOA sutto aita ki ga suru no 
Mou nanimo kowai mono nai kara 
Atarashii yume fukurande mainichi ga Merry-Go-Round 
Aenai toki ni wa setsunai kedo

When we hold hands, it feels like the door to the future has opened 
Because I have nothing to be afraid of anymore 
I'm filled with new dreams, and every day is a merry-go-round 
But the time we spend apart is still painful

Ame no hi mo suki dayo kimi no kasa atatakai 
Itoshisa eien nakunaranai shinjiteru yo 
Ameagari no sora ni niji wo miagete futari 
Itsumademo te wo tsunaide arukitai yo hikari no naka wo

I like rainy days, too, because it's warm under your umbrella 
I have faith that this feeling of love will never end 
When it stops raining, we see a rainbow in the sky above 
I want to hold your hand forever, walking in this light

Aozora ga mabushii kimi ga iru fuukei wa 
Shiawase no OORA afuredasu no tomaranai yo 
Eki mae no funsui niji wo tsukutte iru yo 
Kimi wo matsu jikan sae mo kakegaenai PURESHASU na toki

The scene you're in with a brilliant blue sky 
Overflows with an aura of happiness that never ends 
The fountain in front of the station is creating a rainbow 
Even the time I spend waiting for you is irreplacable and precious

Ame no hi mo suki da yo kimi no kasa atatakai 
Itoshisa eien nakunaranai shinjiteru yo 
Ameagari no sora ni niji wo miagete futari 
Itsumademo te wo tsunaide arukitai yo hikari no naka wo

I like rainy days, too, because it's warm under your umbrella 
I have faith that this feeling of love will never end 
When it stops raining, we see a rainbow in the sky above 
I want to hold your hand forever, walking in this light
                        
                    |
