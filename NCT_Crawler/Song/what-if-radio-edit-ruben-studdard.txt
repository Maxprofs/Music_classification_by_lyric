 Spend the day at the spa (anything you want)
 Different day different time (anything you want)
 Max out my card if you wanna,
 Whatever girl it aint no problem no,
 Take a trip on a yacht (anywhere you want) leave them bags we gonna shop,
 (anywhere you want) girl you know I'll do whatever it takes,
 You know I love you like I used to love cake,

 [Bridge:]
 Would you be cool if things changed,
 If I didn't roll the benz and you didn't push the Range,
 I know what we got it's gone
 Last bay don't be mad but I still gotta ask,

 [Chorus:]
 What if I was broke what if I was slim
 What if couldn't sing and I didn't win
 What if I had to catch the bus I'll still stay
 Wit my momma so there aint no making love baby
 What if I had to used the payphone jus to get my game on would you still
 Wanna put it on me (what if [x3])

 Take the keys to my crib (anytime you want)
 Jus come over take a dip (anytime you want)
 How much you need girl imma front
 You there aint no limit to what I'll do
 No imma break you off wit the ghetto love (anynight you want)
 Take yo time it aint no rush (anynight you want)
 I'm not tryin to do nothing to mess it up if I do I'll spend 4 million to make it up

 [Bridge:]
 Would you be cool if things changed,
 If I didn't roll the benz and you didn't push the Range,
 I know what we gots gonna last and
 Don't be mad but I still gotta ask,

 [Chorus:]

 Baby
 I would give up everything I don't care about money
 My life don't mean a thing not unless your a part of it
 Girl I know for sure that your the only one I need
 Tell me how would your life be would you still be my baby

 [Chorus:]
                        
                    |
