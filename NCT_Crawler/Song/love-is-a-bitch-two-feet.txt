                        Bài hát: Love is a bitch - Two Feet 

[Verse 1]
I'm flyin', I'm flyin' high like a bird
But my fluttering wings can't keep you from pullin' me down
Your mama, your mama says I'm a fool
And yeah, maybe that's true 'cause I can't stop thinkin' 'bout you

[Instrumental Break]

[Verse 2]
I'm tryin', I'm tryin' not to forget my words
'Cause when I'm around you, I tend to keep changin' my mind
I promise, I promise myself not to slip back into old habit
'Cause heartbreak is savvy and love is a bitch

[Instrumental Break]
