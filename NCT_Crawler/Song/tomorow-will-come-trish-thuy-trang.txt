                        As time goes by everyday of my life
How I long for yesterday
Slowly years have gone and come
And I know that you'll wait for me till the end
Looking back on days of the past that we had so long ago
I can't hide these feelings all inside
My love continues to grow
*Bridge*
Without you here everything is unclear
All that's left of me and you
I'll wait endlessly for you and for us for a love
I'll never let go All my life
I'll wait everyday every night for your return
You and I together for all time our flame forever will burn
Oh so faraway I'm holding onto yesterday
I will wait tomorrow tomorrow will come again
*Chorus*
Oh so faraway I'm holding onto yesterday
I will wait tomorrow tomorrow will come again
                        
                    |
