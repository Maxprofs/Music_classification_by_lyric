                        International Love - Pitbull, Chris Brown

You put it down like New York City
I never sleep, wild like Los Angeles
My fantasy, hotter than Miami
I feel the heat
Oh, Miss international love
Oh, Miss international love

I don't play football but I've touched down pretty much
All around the world, all around the world
I don't play baseball but I've hit a home run
All around the world, all around the world

I've been to countries and cities I can't pronounce
And the places on the globe I didn't know existed
In Romania, she pulled me to the side and told me
"Pit, you can have me and my sister"

In Lebanon, yeah, the women are bomb
And in Greece, you've guessed it, the women are sweet
Spinned all around the world but I ain't gon' lie
There's nothing like Miami's heat

You put it down like New York City
I never sleep, wild like Los Angeles
My fantasy, hotter than Miami
I feel the heat
Oh, Miss international love
Oh, Miss international love

Can't I be on looking for visa's?
I'm ain't taking credit cards, if you know what I mean
En Cuba la cosa esta dura
But the woman get down, if you know what I mean

En Colombia women got everything on
Some of the most beautiful women I've ever seen
In Brazil, is freaky big o' booty
And they bounce, blue, yellow and green

En L.A. tengo a la Mexicana
En New York tengo la boricua
Besitos para todas las mujeres en Venezuela, muah
Y en Miami tengo cualquiera

You put it down like New York City
I never sleep, wild like Los Angeles
My fantasy, hotter than Miami
I feel the heat
Oh, Miss international love
Oh, Miss international love

There's not a place
That your love don't affect me, baby
So don't ever change
I crossed the globe when I'm with you, baby
Aye, woah oh

You put it down like New York City
I never sleep, wild like Los Angeles
My fantasy, hotter than Miami
I feel the heat
Oh, Miss international love
Oh, Miss international love
