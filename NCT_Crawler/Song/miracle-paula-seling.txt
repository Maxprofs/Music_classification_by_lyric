                        I don't know if it's right
 But I got a feeling
 And I want to believe
 This is magical
 Is this what it's like?
 Cause I'm starting to feel it
 And I want to believe
 It's incredible

 If you only knew
 All the things I could tell you
 We could be dancing with stars in the night

 It's so magical
 So magical
 So beautiful
 So beautiful
 It's a miracle
 It's a miracle
 I can see it now
 All the things I see
 I think I see them too
 All for you and me
 Just like a dream come true
 It's so beautiful
 No one will ever know
 It's a miracle!

 Now you know that I'm right
 And you got that feelin'
 I told you before
 That is magical
 Yes it's magical

 Now you know
 What it's like
 And you're starting to feel it
 But you just can't deny
 It's incredible

 If only I knew
 All the things you could tell me
 We could be dancing with stars in the night

 It's a miracle
 It's a miracle
 I can see it now
 All the things I see
 I think I see them too
 All for you and me
 Just like a dream come true
 It's so beautiful
 No one will ever know
 It's a miracle!

 It's a miracle oh oh
 It's a miracle oh oh
 I can see it now
 All the things I see
 I think I see them too
 All for you and me
 Just like a dream come true
 It's so beautiful
 No one will ever know
 It's a miracle!
