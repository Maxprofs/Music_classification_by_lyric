                        Bài hát: Somebody Else - Rico Love

It feels a way I can't explain so hold me babe
I know you can't stay too long
And every melody has a way of reminding me of one your favorite songs

And I know we can't turn back time
I know we can't right those wrongs
But at least inside my mind (at least inside my mind, oh yeah)
It doesn't seem like you're gone (gone)
Even though I know you're too busy (ooh ooh) lovin' somebody else
And you're a million miles past gone
I wish my bed was warm but you lovin' somebody else
You can hear my heart saying (ooh ooh), saying (ooh ooh), saying (ooh ooh)
Are you lovin' somebody else?
You can hear my heart saying (ooh ooh), saying (ooh ooh), saying (ooh ooh)
'Cause you lovin' somebody else? (Somebody else)

When I see your face I start to break
I love you babe, it's hard to keep staying strong
'Cause it's takes strength to keep from crying
Wish I knew how to not hold on

And I know we can't turn back time (can't turn back time, no no)
I know we can't right those wrongs
But at least inside my mind (at least inside my mind, oh yeah)
It doesn't seem like you're gone (gone)
Even though I know you're too busy (ooh ooh) lovin' somebody else (lovin' somebody else)
And you're a million miles past gone
I wish my bed was warm but you lovin' somebody else
Oh babe, you can hear my heart saying (ooh ooh), saying (ooh ooh), saying (ooh ooh)
Why are you lovin' somebody else?
You can hear my heart saying (ooh ooh), saying (ooh ooh), saying (ooh ooh)
'Cause you lovin' somebody else? (Somebody else)

You say I treat you like your ex did
So you screaming F this, being to the exit
They say love is like chess, 
Well I've been playing checkers and you was playing Tetris
Complicated and way too many levels
Too many skeletons in my closet, too many devils
Too many elephants in the room, I need a shovel
To maneuver through the manure all we do is settle
Arguments about (about), all my whereabouts (whereabouts)
All the girls I was with (I was with), all the reason that I'mma be without (without)
But I'm honest enough to admit, I shoulda honored your bluff
The material stuff there's hardly enough
Now when I'm calling it's like I'm calling with what
Now I know I shouda buy me a tux (ooh ooh, ooh ooh)

Even though I know you're too busy yeah lovin' somebody else (lovin' somebody else)
And you're a million miles past gone
I wish my bed was warm but you lovin' somebody else (lovin' somebody else)
You can hear my heart saying (ooh ooh), saying (ooh ooh), saying (ooh ooh)
Why are you lovin' somebody else? (Are you lovin' somebody else)
You can hear my heart saying (ooh ooh), saying (ooh ooh), saying (ooh ooh)
'Cause you lovin' somebody else? (Somebody else)
