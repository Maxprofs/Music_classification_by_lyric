                        Bài hát : Sissy That Walk - RuPaul

Pick myself up, turn the world on its head
Don't forget what, don't forget what my mama said
People talking since the beginning of time
Unless they paying your bills, pay them bitches no mind

And if I fly, or if I fall
Least I can say I gave it all
And if I fly, or if I fall
I'm on my way, I'm on my way

(Fly, fly, fly, fly uh oh uh uh oh) [x4]

Uh oh... now sissy that walk!

Better beware
Ain't no T, ain't no shade
But at the same time, bitches better get out the way
I'm a femme queen, mother of a house of no shame
My pussy is on fire, now kiss the flame

And if I fly, or if I fall
Least I can say I gave it all
And if I fly, or if I fall
I'm on my way, I'm on my way

(Fly, fly, fly, fly uh oh uh uh oh) [x4]

Uh oh... now sissy that walk!
