                        Bài hát: Need U - Usher

[Intro]
I *** up
I'm man enough to admit it
But I don't know if that makes a difference
And I know that
If you just give me a chance to explain
I think...I would just...
I need you

[Verse 1]
How you make it feel
Way you make me feel
Says it feels so good
I like it, I like it baby
Girl, what you doing to me
Girl, what you do to me
Don't give 'em my love, you ain't even like that
What kind of point you tryna prove?
And you hate to admit it, but you'd still take me back
All that *** you was talking, it don't hold no weight cause
[Hook]
You always say I'm stuck in my ways (I had it coming)
You always say that I'll never change (in time I'll show you)
It ain't always wrong
I take the blame (that counts for something)
Man up and say, I'll own my mistakes
(gotta count for something)
Girl, I need you now
Oh baby, I need you, oh baby, I need you
Help me now
Don't let me down

[Verse 2]
Girl what I do to you, girl what I do to you
Do to make it this cold
Tryna get me where it hit home
You ain't even like that, I know
You ain't mean it, I know, yeah
New friends, you got new friends
He already know who he’s hittin'
Bet I answer when the real one callin'
You know who it is when you see me callin'
Yeah I know, I was wrong, but you know better
Give you up, I would never

[Hook]
You always say I'm stuck in my ways (I had it coming)
You always say that I'll never change (in time I'll show you)
It ain't always wrong
I take the blame (that counts for something)
Man up and say, I'll own my mistakes
(gotta count for something)
Girl, I need you now
Oh baby, I need you, oh baby, I need you
Help me now
Don't let me down

[Bridge]
Haven't always done you right, and I know it
I hope it ain't too late for me to show it
Don't say goodbye
Forgive me for what I put you through let me love you, babe
All this time you were right

[Hook]
You always say I'm stuck in my ways (I had it coming)
You always say that I'll never change (in time I'll show you)
It ain't always wrong
I take the blame (that counts for something)
Man up and say, I'll own my mistakes
(gotta count for something)
Girl, I need you now
Oh baby, I need you, oh baby, I need you
Help me now
Don't let me down
