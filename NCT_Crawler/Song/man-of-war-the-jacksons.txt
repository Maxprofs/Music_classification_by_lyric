                        You think your way is the best way for all
 You don't know everything so you don't know it all
 You got respect a man for the way that he feels
 And you can't make people do things against their will Man of war, don't go to war no more
 Why don't you, why don't you study peace?
 Man of war, don't go to war no more
 Study peace 'cause peace is what we need Just because your army gives you strength, gives you might
 Truth is gonna win, wrong will never conquer right
 Every man has the right to think and be free
 You're like a spoiled brat, you want everything, you see Man of war, don't go to war no more
 Why don't you, why don't you study peace?
 Man of war, don't go to war no more
 Study peace 'cause peace is what we need You think your bombs guns, and planes make you a big man
 When you attack and invade on another man's land Tryin' to make him be what you want him be
 Make him do what you want him to
 Make him say what you want him to say
 It wasn't meant to be that way You think your way is the best way for all
 You don't know everything so you don't know it all
 You got respect a man for the way that he feels
 You can't make people do things against their will Man of war, don't go to war no more
 Why don't you, why don't you study peace
 Man of war, don't go to war no more
 Study peace 'cause peace is what we need
