                        Bài hát: I Don't Have To Dream - Claire Lynch

Spend a lot of lonely nights
Dreaming of you. 
Every thought in a million years 
It would never come true. 
 But here you are in reality 
Bigger than life. 
Vision of heaven 
Right infront of my eyes.

And I don’t have to dream anymore
I don’t have to close my eyes to see.
Baby now that you’re here with me
I don’t have to dream.

So this is how a story book reads.
Dreams are made up 
You swept me right off my feet
Now I’m falling in love
No more wishing on stars
Like I used to. 
Have got everything I want 

When I hold you
 I don’t have to close my eyes
Baby now that you’re here with me
I don’t have to dream.
                        
                    |
