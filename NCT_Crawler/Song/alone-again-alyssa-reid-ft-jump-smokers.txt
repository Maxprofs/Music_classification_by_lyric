                        Bài hát: Alone Again - Alyssa Reid, Jump Smokers

[Alyssa Reid]
Til now, I always got by on my own
I never really cared until I met you
And now it chills me to the bone
How do I get you alone?

[Jump Smokers]
This one is for you girl
Yeah, I think about you all the time
Tell my friends I be fine but they I be lie

I doing my best to keep you out of my head
And I be trying to fake a smile through my day
Though inside I'm steady dying, uh

Back at shot town
Everything reminding me
I turn on the radio
And even music haunts me

I know I told you this and told you that
But the bottom line is
Baby girl I want you back, uh

[Alyssa Reid]
When you said I could move on and go
You said I'm weak and it shows
I couldn't go on without you

Now I'm sitting in this house alone
Wondering why I left home
And I'm hoping that you know that

Til now, I always got by on my own
I never really cared until I met you
(Til I met you)
And now it chills me to the bone
How do I get you alone?

[Jump Smokers]
I've been out with other girls
And no, it's ain't the same
I still turn my head
Every time I hear your name

Staring at the phone
Can make someone go insane
So I'm hanging at the club
Trying drink away the pain

This is a nightmare
Tell me when I'm waking up
I regret the day that
I decided we were breaking up

Without making up
Even though our minds are stacked
Bottom line is
Baby girl I need you back, uh

[Alyssa Reid]
When you said I could move on and go
You said I'm weak and it shows
I couldn't go on without you

Now I'm sitting in this house alone
Wondering why I left home
And I'm hoping that you know that

Til now, I always got by on my own
I never really cared until I met you
(Til I met you)
And now it chills me to the bone
How do I get you alone?
How do I get you alone?

I wonder where you are tonight
No answer on the telephone
And the night goes by so very slow
Woah, I hope that it won't end though
Alone...

And I'm hoping that you know that

Til now, I always got by on my own
I never really cared until I met you
(Til I met you)
And now it chills me to the bone
How do I get you alone?

Til now, I always got by on my own
I never really cared until I met you
(Til I met you)
And now it chills me to the bone
How do I get you alone?
How do I get you alone?
