                        Bài hát: The Tree (Master Of The Mask OST) - Yoseob

If you are by my side
If I can touch you with my hand
I’m not afraid of anything
If only if I can stay by your side

I know, it’ll be very hard
Sometimes, I will cry
But the scars in my heart, I will keep to myself
Just smile brightly for me like the moonlight

I’ll become a tree
Always protecting you
When things are hard, lean on me
So you can take a break
I’ll wait for you right here

Until you come to me
Whenever that is
Even if it rains and the strong wind blows
Even if the seasons change and everything is different
I’ll be in the same place

I’ll become a tree
Always protecting you
When things are hard, lean on me
So you can take a break
I’ll wait for you right here
Like a tree

Even if you’re not here, I’m alright
Even if my heart aches by myself
I will protect this love

I’ll become a tree
Always protecting you
When things are hard, lean on me
So you can take a break
I’ll wait for you right here
Like a tree
                        
                    |
