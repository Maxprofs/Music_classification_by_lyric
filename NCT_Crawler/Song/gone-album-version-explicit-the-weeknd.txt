                        I got you
 I got a hold of you
 Said you want to see
 How we roll
 Well take a seat (take a seat)
 And we'll just
 Break it, drop it, drink it spill it
 Baby, touch your body, body
 You gotta, taste it, feel it, rub it on me baby
 Don't you worry, you gotta keep up
 Cuz I been gone, I been gone, I been gone, I been gone

 Girl
 Why don't you *** what you heard, baby
 Cause I been gone
 You can see for yourself, lady
 Gotta little bit of something
 Something something, for you
 There's enough to pass around
 Yeah, yeah, yea yea yea yea

 Oh well just
 Break it, drop it, drink it spill it
 Baby, touch your body, body
 Gotta taste it, feel it, rub it on me baby
 Don't you worry, don't you worry, you gotta keep up
 Cause I been gone
 I've been gone, I've been gone, I've been gone
 I've been gone, I've been gone
 I've been gone, I've been gone, I've been gone

 I hope I make it home
 You'll be thinking of it
 I got the whole city on my side, tonight, tonight
 Watch us rock it out
 Watch us leave it girl
 After the show is done
 You can take me to yours

 But my lungs so muddy
 I love the way it taste
 Drink it till I'm ugly baby
 *** me while I'm faded
 Feel that through my denim
 Baby-girl I gotcha
 I'm only 21 so I do it when I wanna
 Gone from the codeine, 'methazine, lean
 Got me feelin' kinda weak
 And it's kinda hard to breathe
 But you're turning 23, so I'll *** you if you need
 In your birthday suit
 I'ma give you what you fiend

 But I ain't taking off my black boots
 I'm fallin'
 Cuz I'm numb from the neck down
 I'm sorry
 You won't know that I can't feel it
 you wont know that I cant feel
 By the way I ***in' did it
 And you'll never ***in' know
 Cuz I'll never ***in' show it
 Except when I be wheezy from that other cup of potion

 Dirty sprite toastin'
 Fast live *** slow
 Low life for life
 Let the meds flow
 Let the night flow
 I'm so gone
 Let these meds flow
 I'm so gone
 Let these meds flow
 I'm so gone
 I'm so gone
 Woah, woah, oh
 Said I'm gone gone gone
 Woah oh

 I'm so gone
 Gone
