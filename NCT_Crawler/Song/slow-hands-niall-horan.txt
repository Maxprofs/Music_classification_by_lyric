                        Bài hát: Slow Hands - Niall Horan

[Verse 1]
We should take this back to my place
That's what she said right to my face
'cause I want you bad, yeah I want you baby
I've been thinking 'bout it all day
And I hope you feel the same, babe (yeah)
'cause I want you bad, yeah I want you baby

[Chorus]
Slow, slow hands
Back sweat dripping down the dirty laundry
No, no chance
That I'm leaving here without you
I know that there's already ain't no stopping
Your plans involves slow hands (woo)
Slow hands

[Verse 2]
I just wanna take my time
We could do this baby, all night (yeah)
'cause I want you bad, yeah I want you baby

[Chorus]
Slow, slow hands
Back sweat dripping down the dirty laundry
No, no chance
That I'm leaving here without you
I know, yeah, that there's already ain't no stopping
Your plans involves slow hands (woo)

[Bridge]
Fingertips putting on a show
Got me now and I can't say no
Wanna be with you all alone
Take me home, take me home
Fingertips putting on a show
Can't you tell that I want you baby (yeah)

[Chorus]
Slow, slow hands
Back sweat dripping down the dirty laundry
No, no chance
That I'm leaving without you
I know, yeah, that there's already ain't no stopping
Slow, slow hands
Back sweat dripping down the dirty laundry
No, no chance
That I'm leaving without you
I know, yeah, that there's already ain't no stopping
Your plans involves slow hands (woo)
Slow hands, slow hands
