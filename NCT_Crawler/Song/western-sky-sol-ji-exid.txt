                        Bài hát: Western Sky - Sol Ji (EXID)

The red glow dims in the western sky 
You’ve turned into sadness 
I don’t think I could ever call you again 
So I call you again now

No matter how I shout and cry for you
All I get back from the empty space is your broken name 
I don’t have the strength to go on anymore
Because you leave me 

The days of love, the day you left me 
The day the sky was so sad it cried for me 
It’s as if you already knew
That I would leave with the rain 

On rainy days, I always miss you 
I await the day that we’ll meet again 
Why does the sky make me so sad after it rains?
I want to erase you with my tears 

I want to go, I want to see you, I want to find you 
But you’re still there 
But I love you
                        
                    |
