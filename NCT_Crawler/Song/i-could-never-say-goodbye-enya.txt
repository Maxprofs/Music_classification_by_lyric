                        Bài hát: I Could Never Say Goodbye - Enya

Night has gone without my tears
Now I walk alone
You're no longer here
The days turn to years

I could never say goodbye
To the sadness in my eyes
You know you are in my heart
But the miles keep us apart

Time moves slow
In the falling rain
I still dream of you
And whisper your name
Will I see you once again?

I could never say goodbye
To the sadness in my eyes
You know you are in my heart
But the miles keep us apart

I could never say goodbye
                        
                    |
