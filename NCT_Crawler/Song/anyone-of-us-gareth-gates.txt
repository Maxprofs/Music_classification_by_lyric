                        Bài hát: Anyone Of Us - Gareth Gates

I've been letting you down, down 
Girl, I know I've been such a fool 
Giving in to temptation 
I should of played it cool 

The situation got out of hand 
I hope you understand... 


It can happen to anyone of us 
Anyone you think of 
Anyone can fall 
Anyone can hurt someone they love 
Hearts will break 
'Cause I made a stupid mistake 
It can happen to anyone of us 
Say you will forgive me 
Anyone can fail 
Say you will believe me 
I can't take 
My heart will break 
'Cause I made a stupid mistake...a stupid mistake 

She was kind of exciting 
A little crazy 
I should of known 
She must have altered my senses 
As I offered to walk her home 

The situation got out of hand 
I hope you understand... 



It can happen to anyone of us 
Anyone you think of 
Anyone can fall 
Anyone can hurt someone they love 
Hearts will break 
'Cause I made a stupid mistake 
It can happen to anyone of us 
Say you will forgive me 
Anyone can fail 
Say you will believe me 
I can't take 
My heart will break 
'Cause I made a stupid mistake...a stupid mistake 
a stupid mistake 

She means nothing to me...nothing to me 
I swear every word is true 
Don't wanna lose you 

The situation got out of hand 
I hope you understand 

It can happen to anyone of us 
Anyone you think of 
Anyone can fall 
Anyone can hurt someone they love 
Hearts will break 
'Cause I made a stupid mistake 
It can happen to anyone of us 
Say you will forgive me 
Anyone can fail 
Say you will believe me 
I can't take 
My heart will break 
'Cause I made a stupid mistake... 

Anyone can fall 
Anyone can hurt someone they love 
Their hearts will break 
'Cause I made a stupid mistake...a stupid mistake...
