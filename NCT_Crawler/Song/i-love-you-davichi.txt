                        Bài hát: I Love You - Davichi

English Translation:
So many stories come and go
But only I have one story about a person for several years now
Now it’s a story about a person that only you don’t know and everyone else knows

If things are hard, I cry by myself
A sadness that isn’t even necessary
Because I hate being told to forget you

Words that haven’t even cooled down – I love you
Haven’t you ever been curious about my heart?
Loving someone to the point where you hate them
Do you know how that feels?

I’ve done nothing but love
But they keep telling me to fall in love now
No one brings up stories about you in front of me

On good days, I laugh by myself
But it’s awkward because I can’t laugh loudly
Because I hate it when they worry about me

Words that haven’t even cooled down – I love you
Haven’t you ever been curious about my heart?
Loving someone to the point where you hate them
Do you know how that feels?

When tears rise up, I sing that
Ddurururu
Sad melody – probably about a thousand times

I, I love you
Are you trying to ignore me?
The more I love, the more afraid I get that you might get distant
So only my lies keep increasing
I don’t want to lose you
