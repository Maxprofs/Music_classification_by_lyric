                        Bài hát: Still Down - H.E.R.

[Verse 1]
You need the time I will have it
I try not to make it a habit
But I can't promise that
Wish I could do that
Cause you deserve
Actions and not words
And you know that I'm worth
Waiting for
While I'm out on tour

[Chorus]
Tell me right now
Are you still down?
Are you still down?
Tell me right now
Are you still down? (Are you?)
Are you still down?

[Verse 2]
When I ain't there and you get the urge
Who you hittin it first?
Is it me or it's her?
I be thinkin the worse
When you don't pick up
But I don't call enough
It's only for now
This won't be forever but I think that we will
If you

[Chorus x2]

[Outro]
If I put all my faith to you
Will you be faithful
Hold me down baby I know that ain't easy to do (do do do)
Don't be stupid
You know I do this for you (you you you)
Down
Down
Are you still
Are you still
Are you still
                        
                    |
