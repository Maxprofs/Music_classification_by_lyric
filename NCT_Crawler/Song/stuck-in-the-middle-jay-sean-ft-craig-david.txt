                        I'm just sitting here, tryna forget 'bout all those years, and I
 I can't take the thought of him alone with you, alone with you
 It's been a year or so, and you moved on and left me cold, and I
 I wish that I could let you know that I still got a thing for you But you got another man, he says he loves you too
 Baby girl, I understand this must be hard on you
 And it gets so hard sometimes to know just what to do
 Stuck in the middle with you You and I through it all
 Sunny days, through the storms
 Still I know he can never love you like me
 Girl, I know he and you going new
 He messed it up with it all
 No, he can never love you like me Can we go back again as lovers not as friends
 'Cause I know he can never love you like me
 Girl, I've been there before
 Time to close that open door, I know
 That he can never love you like me I was the one you came running to
 When tears would fall from what he do
 Who knew the friends would become lovers
 Going crazy giving my all but getting halfa you
 I'm not half the man so tell me what to do
 Never gonna let you go 'cause you know our love is true Babe, you got another man, but he's not good for you
 Baby girl, I understand but this ain't all on you
 And it gets so hard some time to know just what to do
 Stuck in the middle with you You and I through it all
 Sunny days, through the storms
 Still I know he can never love you like me
 Girl, I know he and you going new
 He messed it up with it all
 No, he can never love you like me Can we go back again as lovers not as friends
 'Cause I know he can never love you like me
 Girl, I've been there before
 Time to close that open door, I know
 That he can never love you like me I know that you will never find another love like
 Me and you can look but won't find another man like
 Me and even though you might have separated from me
 Gotta make a choice can't wait forever You and I through it all
 Sunny days, through the storms
 Still I know he can never love you like me
 Girl, I know he and you going new
 He messed it up with it all
 No, he can never love you like me Can we go back again as lovers not as friends
 'Cause I know he can never love you like me
 Girl, I've been there before
 Time to close that open door, I know
 That he can never love you like me
 Love you like me, love you like me
