                        Bài hát: Hard Out Here - Lily Allen

I suppose I should tell you what this bitch is thinking 
You'll find me in the studio and not in the kitchen 
I won't be bragging 'bout my cars or talking 'bout my chains 
Don't need to shake my ass for you 'cause I've got a brain 

If I told you about my sex life, you'd call me a slut 
When boys be talking about their bitches, no one's making a fuss 
There's a glass ceiling to break, aha, there's money to make 
And now it's time to speed this up 'cause I can't move in this space 

[Bridge] 
Sometimes it's hard to find the words to say 
I'll go ahead and say them anyway 
Forget your balls and grow a pair of tits 

[Chorus] 
It's hard, it's hard, it's hard out there for a bitch 
It's hard, for a bitch (for a bitch) 
For a bitch, it's hard 
It's hard out here for a bitch 
It's hard, for a bitch (for a bitch) 
For a bitch, it's hard 
It's hard out here 

You're not a size six, and you're not good looking 
Well you better be rich, or be real good at cooking 
You should probably lose some weight 
'Cause we can't see your bones 
You should probably fix your face or you'll end up on your own 

Don't you want to have somebody who objectifies you? 
Have you thought about your butt? Who's gonna tear it in two? 
We've never had it so good, aha, we're out of the woods 
And if you can't detect the sarcasm, you're misunderstood 

[Chorus] 
A bitch, a bitch, a bitch, bitch, bitch [x4] 

Inequality promises that it's here to stay 
Always trusty in justice 'cause it's not going away 
Inequality promises that it's here to stay 
Always trusty in justice 'cause it's not going away
                        
                    |
