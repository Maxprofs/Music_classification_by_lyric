                        Well I'm an
 Axegrinder, piledriver
 Mother says that
 I never, never mind her
 Got no brains I'm insane
 The teacher says that
 I'm one big pain

 I'm like a laser
 6-streamin' razor
 I got a mouth like
 An alligator
 I want it louder
 More power
 I'm gonna rock ya
 'Till it strikes the hour

 Bang your head
 Metal Health'll drive you mad
 Band your head
 Metal Health'll drive you mad
 Alright!

 Well I'm remonstrated
 Outdated I really want
 To be over-rated
 I'm a finder and I'm a keeper
 I'm not a loser and
 I ain't no weeper
 I got the boys
 To make the noise
 Won't ever let up
 Hope it annoys you
 Join the pack, Fill the crack
 Well now you're here
 There's no way back

 Bang your head
 Metal Health'll drive you mad
 Bang your head
 Metal Health'll drive you mad
 Metal Health'll cure your crazy
 Metal Health'll cure your mad
 Metal Health is what we a-a-a-a-all need
 It's what you outta to have

 [Guitar Solo]

 Bang your head
 Wake the dead
 We're all metal mad
 It's all you have
 So bang your head
 And raise the dead
 Oh yeah!
 Metal Health
 It's not too bad
 Bad, Bad, Bad

 Bang your head
 Metal Health'll drive you mad
 Bang your head
 Metal Health'll drive you mad
 Oh get your
 Straight-jackets on tonight
 Oh!
 Metal Health'll drive you mad
 The bad boys are gonna set you right
 Oh... Rock on Rock on Rock on
 Metal health'll drive you mad
 Bang your head!
