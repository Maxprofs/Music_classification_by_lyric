 Got a smile that tendy wide
 Everything you say you tell me baby
 And my heart just fills with pride
 Cause I got
 Something to shout about
 Oh yes I have
 Gonna tell the whole wide world

 Something to shout about
 Oh yes I have
 Say ya gonna be my girl
 (Instrumental)
 I guess that anyone can see that I'm a dreamer
 I always dream of you
 I don't care if you say that I'm a dreamer
 Since the day my dream came true
 Cause I got

 Something to shout about
 Oh yes I have
 Say ya gonna be my girl

 Got a smile that's tendy wide
 Everyday you say you love me baby
 And my heart just fills with pride
 Cause I got

 Gonna tell the whole wide world

 Something to shout about

 Say ya gonna be my girl
 Well I got
 Something to shout about
