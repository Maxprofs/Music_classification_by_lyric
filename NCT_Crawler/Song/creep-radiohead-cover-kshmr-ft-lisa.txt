                        Bài hát: Creep (Radiohead Cover) - KSHMR, Lisa

[Verse 1]
When you were here before
Couldn't look you in the eye
You're just like an angel
Your skin makes me cry
You float like a feather
In a beautiful world

[Pre-Chorus]
I wish I was special
You're so fuckin' special

[Chorus]
But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doing here?
I don't belong here

[Post-Chorus]
What the hell am I doing here?

[Verse 2]
I don't care if it hurts
I want a have control
I want a perfect body
I want a perfect soul
I want you to notice
When I'm not around

[Pre-Chorus]
You're so fuckin' special
I wish I was special

[Chorus]
But I'm a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doing here?
I don't belong here
                        
                    |
