                        Chorus1) 
My baby~ I love you so much forever you and I
I love you oh~I love you so much forever you and I
My baby~ I love you so much forever you and I
I love you oh~I love you so much forever you and I

Time may pass,
But I can't make any of it return
One, two, my worries are piling up 
I will blame myself for everything.
Days have passed, but nothing has meaning any more.
This moment without you 
To me is like having no emotions at all
Tell Me~

Chorus2) 
Please tell me why~
Why did you go and leave me?~
Please tell me why~
Love has left me, Tell me
Please tell me why~
Come back to me again
I've forgotten all those memories if pain in the past
So we can start again, Baby~

Repeat Chorus1

Rap) 
You ask girlfriend 
How have you been? 
It may seem clear to you that I am like a foolish man
This thing in us is like something we've forgotten 
Its like I have a hole in my heart that is still empty
Once my tears start I can't seem to dry them
I often walk hoping to run into you
I look around if you look at me
It's because of you, My Girl 
Just once you will too 
I don't know you looked for me there
At that place where you and I went together
Come back to me again, My sweet heart

Repeat Chrous1
Repeat Chorus2
Repeat Chorus1

I am here now
I'm always waiting for you~
What should I do?
I can't make any of it return!
Come back to me again~
                        
                    |
