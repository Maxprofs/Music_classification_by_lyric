                        Bài hát: Annie's Wonderland - Bandari

My name is Annie 
I'm about your daughter's age 
Happy with my living, earning minimum wage 
Last year I had a baby, 
Love him with all I got 
But the bills, they became too much, so I moved a little pot

Now I'm an ex-patriot in my hometown 
I can't even vote to change the laws that put me down 
I only pray that you fare better 
I'll wear my marijuana leaf like a badge, it's my scarlet letter

Time goes slow here 
From behind these bars 
But I'm not so far away that I can't hear the cars 
Driving down the freeway 
Wishing one of them could give 
me that short ride downtown where my little boy lives

But I'm an ex-patriot in my hometown 
I can't even vote to change the laws that put me down 
I only pray that you fare better 
I'll wear my marijuana leaf like a badge, it's my scarlet letter

Now I don't want you 
to feel sorry for me 
I ain't on bended knee for your sympathy 
I knew it wasn't legal 
but was it really so wrong 
to justify locking me up here for so damn long

Well, I'm an ex-patriot in my hometown 
I can't even vote to change the laws that put me down 
I only pray that you fare better 
I'll wear my marijuana leaf like a badge, it's my scarlet letter
                        
                    |
