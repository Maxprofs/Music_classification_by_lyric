                        You gotta re-... verse that motion when you're with me
To ride this ride
Don't hesitate go in the speed tonight
No time to waste
We can get away
So baby come with me
And I'll fulfill your fantasy

You can get anywhere that you wanna
Tonight is all on me
Waiting for that bom bom bom bom boy
Come lay it down on me

Now we're together
We gonna be bumbin up them straights
I feel your pressure
I got that overdrive you need

You got me right there where you want me
Your hands all on my body
This feels so right
Let's park it right here babe that's how I like it

Backseat windows up that's the way that I like to (oh)
Backseat windows up that's the way that I like to (go)

I'm putting in
That special order for you
For tonight
You want that
On the side
We both grown
So turnt on
Put all your love in me
Baby put all your love in me

You can get anywhere that you want now
Tonight is all on me
Waiting for that bom bom bom bom boy
Come lay it down on me

Now we're together
We gonna be bumbin up them straights
I feel your pressure
I got that overdrive you need

You got me right there where you want me
Your hands all on my body
This feels so right
Let's park it right here babe that's how I like it

Backseat windows up that's the way that I like to... Backseat windows up that's the way that I like to...

I think somebody's watching but I don't care
It's just me and you
Yeah, let's keep going

The windows fogged up the car is rockin
My feet all on the dash we ain't stopping
Right there, don't stop

You got me right there where you want me
Your hands all on my body
This feels so right
Let's park it right here babe that's how I like it
