                        The door slams, dust falls down between the cracks
 Some ran, some promised they'd be back
 Saigon, all gone, ashes to dust
 A solo dance, a solo dance And when we leave, we leave our dust
 We slap our clothes, we shake it off
 Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam
 Out of the dust reach tiny hands to touch their fathers in other lands Love is locked in these lost eyes
 Love is lost in these cold eyes
 And in these wounds too raw to touch
 Lie ashes, ashes, dust to dust And when we leave, we leave our dust
 We slap our clothes, we shake it off
 Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam
 Out of the dust reach tiny hands to touch their fathers in other lands We are free, we are not alone
 Listen to our sound
 And take these hands of flesh and bone
 Reaching out for love Discards settle where they must
 Never knowing who to trust
 And in these dreams that lie in rust
 Ashes, ashes, dust to dust And when we leave, we leave our dust
 We slap our clothes, we shake it off
 Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam
 Out of the dust reach tiny hands to touch their fathers in other lands We are free, we are free
