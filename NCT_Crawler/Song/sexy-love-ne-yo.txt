                        Song: Sexy Love - Ne-Yo

My sexy love

She makes the hairs on the back of my neck stand up
Just one touch
And I errupt like a volcano and cover her with my love
Babygirl you make me say 
And I just can't think
Than to hear you sing
When we do our thing 
Babygirl you make me say 

Sexy love girl the things you do
Keep me sprung, keep running back to you
Oh I love making love to you
Babygirl you know you're my

I'm so addicted to her she's the sweetest drug
Just enough
Still too much say that I'm simp and I'm sprung all of the above
I can't help she makes me say 
And I just can't think
Than to hear you sing 
When we do our thing 
Oh, babygirl you make me say 

Sexy love girl the things you do
Keep me sprung, keep running back to you
Oh I love making love to you
Say babygirl you know you're my

Oh baby what we do it makes the sun come up
Keep on lovin' 'til it goes back down
And I don't know what I'd do if I would lose your touch
That's why I'm always keepin' you around my sexy love

Sexy love girl the things you do 
Keep me sprung, keep running back to you 
Oh I love making love to you
Say babygirl you know you're my

Sexy love girl the things you do
Keep me sprung, keep running back to you
Oh I love making love to you
Say babygirl you know you're my

She makes the hairs on the back of my neck stand up
Just one touch
