                        Come on
 Baby, don't you wanna go home
 Come on
 Baby, don't you wanna go home
 Back from the land of California
 To my sweet home Chicago Come on
 Baby, don't you wanna go home
 Come on
 Baby, don't you wanna go home
 Back from the land of California
 To my sweet home Chicago Two and two is four, babe
 Four into two is eight
 Come on now girl, don't you now make me late
 And I've got to leave Baby, don't you wanna go home
 Back from the land of California
 To my sweet home Chicago One and one is two
 Two and two is four
 I'm here lonely, I hook and I gotta go
 And I cry please Baby, don't you wanna go home
 Back from the land of California
 To my sweet home Chicago Come on
 Baby, don't you wanna go home
 Come on
 Baby, don't you wanna go home
 Back from the land of California
 To my sweet home Chicago Come on
 Baby, don't you wanna go
 Come on
 Baby, don't you wanna go home
 Back from the land of California
 To my sweet home Chicago
