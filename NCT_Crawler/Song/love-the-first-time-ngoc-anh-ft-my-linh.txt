                        Bài hát: Love The First Time - Ngọc Anh, Mỹ Linh

The time, goes by slowly
Memory, it’s black and white
My sorrow, who can hear me?
The sunshine, has lost its light.
From afar, do you recall?
How we play our silly games.
Knowing we’ve given our all
Then you know, on ones to blame.
Oh oh oh love, your forever
Though we are apart
Knowing it’s over, you are always in my heart.
Those in love must remember,
Love with all of your heart just like the first time,
Can you recall our love the first time?
                        
                    |
