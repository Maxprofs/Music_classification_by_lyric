                        She may be the face I cant forget
a trace of pleasure or regret
may be the treasure
or the price I have to pay

She may be the song that summer sings
may be the chill that autumn brings
may be a hundred different things
within the measure of a day

She may be the beauty or the beast
may be the famine or the feast
may turn each day into a heaven or a hell
She may be the mirror of my dreams
the smile reflected in the stream
she may not be what she may seem
inside her shell

She who always seems so happy in a crowd,
whose eyes can be so private and so proud
no ones allowed to see them when they cry
She may be the love that cannot hope to last
may come to me from shadows of the past
that I'd remember till the day I die

She may be the reason I survive
the why and wherefore I'm alive
the one I'll care for
through the rough and ready years
Me, I'll take her laughter and her tears
and make them all my souvenirs
for where she goes I've got to be
the meaning of my life is She

She may be the love that cannot hope to last
may come to me from shadows of the past
that I'll remember till the day I die

She may be the reason I survive
the why and wherefore I'm alive
the one I'll care for
through the rough and ready years
Me, I'll take her laughter and her tears
and make them all my souvenirs
for where she goes I've got to be
the meaning of my life is She

She....
the meaning of my life is She
