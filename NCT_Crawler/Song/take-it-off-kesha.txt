                        Bài hát: Take It Off - Ke$ha

There’s a place downtown 
Where’s the freaks all come around 
It’s a hole in the wall it’s a dirty free for all 
When the dark of the night 
Comes around that’s the time 
That’s the animal comes alive 
Looking for something wild 
And now we looking like pimp 
In my gold trans-am 
Got a water full of whiskey in my handbag 
Got my drunk text on 
I’ll regret it in the mornin’ 
But tonight I don’t give a I don’t give a I don’t give a 
There’s a place downtown 
Where’s the freaks all come around 
It’s a hole in the wall it’s a dirty free for all 
And they turn me on 
When they take it off 
When they take it off 
Everybody take it off 
There’s a place I know when you looking for a show 
Where they go hardcore 
And there’s glitter on the floor 
And they turn me on 
When they take it off 
When they take it off 
Everybody take it off 
Lose your mind lose it now lose your clothes 
In the crowd we’re delirious tear it down 
‘Til the sun comes back around 
N-now we’re getting so smashed 
Knocking over trash cans eurbody breakin’ bottles 
It’s a filthy hot mess gonna get faded 
I’m not the designated driver so 
I don’t give a I don’t give a I don’t give a 
There’s a place downtown 
Where’s the freaks all come around 
It’s a hole in the wall it’s a dirty free for all 
And they turn me on 
When they take it off 
When they take it off 
Everybody take it off 
There’s a place I know when you looking for a show 
Where they go hardcore 
And there’s glitter on the floor 
And they turn me on 
When they take it off 
When they take it off 
Everybody take it off 
Oooh! Oooh! Oooh everybody take it off 
Oooh! Oooh! Oooh everybody take it off 
Right now! Take it off right now! Take it off 
Right now! Take it off Oooh 
Right now! Take it off right now! Take it off 
Right now! Take it off Oooh 
Everybody take it off 
There’s a place downtown 
Where’s the freaks all come around 
It’s a hole in the wall it’s a dirty free for all 
And they turn me on 
When they take it off 
When they take it off 
Everybody take it off 
There’s a place I know when you looking for a show 
Where they go hardcore 
And there’s glitter on the floor 
And they turn me on 
When they take it off 
When they take it off 
Everybody take it off
