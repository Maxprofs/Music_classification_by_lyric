                        Bài hát: Glass House - Red

We deceive the world with lies we hide
Behind the smiles
We can see the home of desperate hearts
The truth has fallen down
The illusion we've become
A fear we can't outrun
We're closing in our emptiness
We're broken

You alone, You can see right through
This glass house we call home
You alone, You can take away the pain
Yeah, You have shown, You can break right through this glass house of our souls
Make us whole again, Make us whole

We fight to cover up the scars
From our charade
There's a war between who we are
And who we make believe
It's over now, we're fallen' but...

You alone, You can see right through
This glass house we call home
You alone, You can take away the pain
Yeah, You have shown, You can break right through this glass house of our souls
Make us whole again, Make us whole

I, I'm running to escape the walls
That have trapped this heart in
The door is open, please come save me
I, I never want to hide behind
The disguise that I've become
That I've become

Cause You alone, You can take away the pain
Yeah, You have shown, You can find a way to change
Yeah, You alone, You can see right through
This glass house of our souls
Make us whole again
Make us whole again

Make us whole again
