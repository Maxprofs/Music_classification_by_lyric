                        When i met you.
 I almost missed you.
 As you stood right next to me.
 In the aisle between detergents and wine.
 Just in front of instant mien.

 You were trolling, your little trolley as I stopped to let you through.
 Then you turn around with the sweetest smile and I lost my heart to you.

 You never come again though i look for you
 in every row from A to Z.
 I caught up in you so hopelessly.
 I forget my groceries.
 Now every time I go to that corner store,
 I just keep thinking you'll be there.
 Yes, it's crazy to think i love you. Supermarket love affair


 Now I wander beside the counter.
 Where you turned to smile at me
 And I hope to catch a glimpse of your face, but all I see is fantasy
