                        Yeah, yeah, come on man
 (Dump dump dump)
 You know this *** is ours man this is our field man
 (Dump dump dump)
 Y'all niggaz need to just leave this *** to us
 (Dump dump dump)
 Corny-ass niggaz, aiyyo
 (Dump dump dump) That's that hard ***
 That hit a nigga up in his car ***, this war bitch
 Somehow I feel we need more of the thing
 Instinct to get that paper, know it's all in my vein You rookies need to be toilet trained
 You fagots ***ting everywhere that you eating
 That's why the coroner came
 You never know, when the tec'll blow
 Wet you and catch you off guard
 Niggaz know that I crept slow And never fold bitch, hollows we let 'em go
 And hope them little jugs you sold cover your medical
 Y'all don't wanna bump heads with us
 Dump lead head to head with us, nah And ain't no leg-in homey, neck and up
 It come to beef, you know we chef-fen it up, all day baby
 And ain't nobody do it better than us
 Dry snitch and we wetting you up
 (Dump dump dump) Many men try to set me up to watch me die
 Tie me up and put me in the trunk then wave bye-bye
 (Dump dump dump)
 Everyone who know me know that I'm Mobb Deep
 And I keep it true and ain't afraid to shoot so duck when I
 (Dump dump dump) Ain't gon' catch me slipping up, ain't gon' catch me give it up
 (Dump dump dump)
 Ain't gon' hear me creeping up roll down the window I'm about to
 (Dump dump dump) Nigga I'll smack that smirk right off your face
 You listen to jerk music, this is Mobb Deep
 You ain't never seen or heard no *** like this
 Until you purchase our CD, it's very worth it Don't confuse our album with that mix tape ***
 Those our scratch, basically our throwaway ***
 And nobody wrap the street like the infamous clique
 Slash jive, now we got millions to work with And we violators too, so you know we overdoing it
 What's stopping the crew, only death can ruin it, bring it
 Homey been there and done that, and still they wanna come back
 And shoot us down, blaow blaow blaow Our advice, you want something done right
 Then you better come and do it yourself
 We give shooters this ***s, make O.G.'s get they gun off the shelf
 And blow the dust off they old snub-nose three pound
 (Dump dump dump) Many men try to set me up to watch me die
 Tie me up and put me in the trunk then wave bye-bye
 (Dump dump dump)
 Everyone who know me know that I'm Mobb Deep
 And I keep it true and ain't afraid to shoot so duck when I
 (Dump dump dump) Ain't gon' catch me slipping up, ain't gon' catch me give it up
 (Dump dump dump)
 Ain't gon' hear me creeping up roll down the window I'm about to
 (Dump dump dump) Shoot 'em up now bang, bang
 Don't *** around with the wrong man
 In every ***ing city it's the same thing
 Don't be saying nothing stupid to a grown man Shoot 'em up now bang, bang
 It really ain't the same, now the game changed
 Got me gripping on my weapon just to maintain
 Fill you full of holes and get my name changed Many men try to set me up to watch me die
 Tie me up and put me in the trunk then wave bye-bye
 (Dump dump dump)
 Everyone who know me know that I'm Mobb Deep
 And I keep it true and ain't afraid to shoot so duck when I
 (Dump dump dump) Ain't gon' catch me slipping up, ain't gon' catch me give it up
 (Dump dump dump)
 Ain't gon' hear me creeping up roll down the window I'm about to
 (Dump dump dump)
