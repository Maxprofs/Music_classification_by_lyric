                        Tomorrow's way too far away
 And we can't get back yesterday
 But we young right now
 We hot right now
 So get up right now
 Cause all we got is Right Now

 Tomorrow's way too far away
 And we can't get back yesterday
 But we young right now
 We hot right now
 So get up right now
 Cause all we got is Right Now

 [Beat break]

 Something you wanted to do what you like
 There's no more waiting tonight is the night
 And we can't be wrong not if it feels this right
 Turn it up, sing it loud
 But we got right now
                        
                    |
