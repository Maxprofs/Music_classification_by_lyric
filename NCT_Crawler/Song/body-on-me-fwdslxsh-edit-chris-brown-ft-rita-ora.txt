                        Bài hát: Body On Me (Fwdslxsh Edit) - Chris Brown, Rita Ora

[Rita Ora:]
Baby, let's cut down the lights
I just really wanna let this fire burn bright
I'm just telling you to have an open mind
Just imagine us

[Rita Ora:]
You're taking me there, you're taking me there
Our lips are barely touching
So do it again, so do it again
We could be on to something

[Rita Ora:]
Heyo, heyo, I just wanna feel your body on me
Heyo, heyo, if you want it then you got it, hold me
No more, no more wasting time
We can, we can go all night
Heyo, heyo, I just wanna feel your body on me
Ayayayayayayayayaya
Body on me
Ayayayayayayayayaya
Body on me

[Chris Brown:]
Put you up against the wall
And I'ma go to work 'til you get off
Baby, soon as you're done we'll go some more
Girl, just imagine us

[Rita Ora & Chris Brown:]
You're taking me there, you're taking me there
Our lips are barely touching
So do it again, so do it again
We could be on to something

[Rita Ora:]
Heyo, heyo, I just wanna feel your body on me
Heyo, heyo, if you want it then you got it, hold me
No more, no more wasting time
We can, we can go all night
Heyo, heyo, I just wanna feel your body on me
Ayayayayayayayayaya
Body on me
Ayayayayayayayayaya
Your body on me
Ayayayayayaya
Your body on me
Ayayayayayayayayaya

[Chris Brown & Rita Ora:]
I'm not asking for too much, put your fingertips on me
Don't wait 'til the sun's up, we can keep this in between
Us, only nobody has to know what's going down right now baby

[Rita Ora & Chris Brown:]
Heyo, heyo, I just wanna feel your body on me
Heyo, heyo, if you want it then you got it, hold me
No more, no more wasting time
We can, we can go all night
Heyo, heyo, I just wanna feel your body on me
Ayayayayayayayayaya
Body on me
Ayayayayayayayayaya
Your body on me
Ayayayayayayayayaya
Body on me
Ayayayayayayayayaya
Body on me
