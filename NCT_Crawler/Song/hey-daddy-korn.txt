                        Let me see
 (Let me see)
 All my life has been
 (Taken)
 Taken This demon
 (Haunts me)
 Haunts me
 They're waiting
 (Help me)
 Help me You *** me up, I'm gagged and bound
 You pick me up, when I am down
 I can not live without them
 I do not live without them Hey, Daddy
 (Daddy)
 They are taking me
 (Away)
 Putting things in me
 (What soul)
 My soul
 They're eating
 Please help me You *** me up, I'm gagged and bound
 You pick me up, when I am down
 I can not live without them
 I do not live without them They tell me this thing inside of me
 Wants to get out
 All it does is scream and shout
 I'm trying not to let them out They tell me to hurt myself
 They tell me to hurt myself
 They tell me to hurt myself
 But I'm not gonna listen You *** me up, I gagged and bound
 You pick me up, when I am down
 I cannot live without them
 I do not live without them You *** me up, I'm gagged and bound
 You pick me up, when I am down
 I can not live without them
 I do not live without them Hey Daddy, hey Daddy
 (Waiting)
 Hey, Daddy
 (Waiting)
 Daddy
