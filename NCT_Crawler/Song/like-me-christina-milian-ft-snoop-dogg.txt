                        Bài hát: Like Me - Christina Milian, Snoop Dogg

(Chorus – Christina Milian)
Can’t nobody love you like me
Can’t nobody hug you like me
Can’t nobody touch you like me
Like me, like me, like me, like me
Can’t nobody love you like me
Can’t nobody hug you like me
Can’t nobody touch you like me
Like me, like me, like me, like me

(Verse 1 – Christina Milian)
Baby I know I’ve been all on your mind
Can’t help it gets so hard every time
I put it on you, I’ll have you wishing you mine
The truth is the truth, real love is so hard to find

(Bridge – Christina Milian)
You ain’t never gon do better
You ain’t never find no lover
In your arms, in your arms
Your arms, your arms, your arms, your arms
Give me your heart, I’ll keep it
Room for all them secrets
I’ll go hard, I’ll go hard
Go hard, go hard, go hard, go hard

(Repeat Chorus)

(Verse 2 – Christina Milian)
When we’re alone I feel so alone
You get so high because it’s me by your side
Boy you the truth but I’m all on your mind
And there ain’t no doubt that you’d pick me every time

(Repeat Bridge & Chorus)

(Verse 3 – Snoop Dogg)
Christiana, Mrs. Misdemeanor
Gold Beamer
King and the Queener
Dripping like an Aquifina
Pick and roll on the screen a
Winter on the date with the cake and the ice cream-a
Big dreamer, make it your reality
Big dog, get it all, can you handle me?
Don’t freeze when the moment arrive
Don’t trip, I’ll dip, if you want me to ride, go
Girl it’s live, low on the ride
Open your eyes
3-4, playing the five
Stay in the vibe, lay in the hive
Bonnie and Clyde
You CT this D, got you hypnotized

(Repeat Bridge & Chorus)
