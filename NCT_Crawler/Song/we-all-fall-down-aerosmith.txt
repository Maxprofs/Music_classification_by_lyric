Rock|

                        When your heart is breakin'
 When your faith has been shakin'
 When the road you're takin'
 Takes you nowhere at all
 When it all
 Seems to all go wring
 Remember nobody can always be strong
 We all fall down I will catch you
 Never let you go
 I won't let you
 Go through it alone
 So don't feel left out
 We all fall down
 We all fall down When your dreams are shattered
 When you feel broken and battered
 When every step on the ladder
 Takes you nowhere
 But down
 And you lose ground
 Like you can't hold on
 Remember nobody can always be strong
 We all fall down I will catch you
 Never let you go
 I won't let you
 Go through it alone
 So don't feel left out
 We all fall I will lift you
 High above the rain
 I've been with you
 We all feel the pain
 So don't feel left out
 We all fall down
 We all fall down Everyone breaks
 We all get hurt sometimes
 In this life
 Fly so high
 We crash and burn sometimes
 And I want you to know
 Oh you are not alone
 We all fall down
 (Yeah, we all fall down) I will catch you
 Never let you go
 I won't let you
 Go through it alone
 So don't feel left out
 We all fall I will lift you
 High above the rain
 I've been with you
 We all feel the pain
 Don't feel left out
 We all fall down
 We all fall I will catch you
 (I will catch you)
 I wont let you So don't feel left out
 We all fall down
 We all fall down
