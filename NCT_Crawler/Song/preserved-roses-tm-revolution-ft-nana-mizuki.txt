English

Pressed under every brief and fleeting dream,
The flower becomes a piece of eternity.
The deception pains the heart.
It will present to you
The loneliness of a caged life. Preserved Rose...

You only need to take what flows forth from deep within and change it into human form.
Everything is “too cold”, you say – then don’t unclasp your fingers from mine.

We can exist within either light or darkness.
Don’t be afraid – the morning that you dread will not come.
We’ll repeat only brilliance.
Connecting, then ending – once again...


Pressed under every brief and fleeting dream,
The flower becomes a piece of eternity.
The deception, ever so painfully,
Cuts deeply into the world that rejects it.

If you wish, I’ll let you captivate me,
So don’t fade into the distance and disappear.
I’ll greet with open arms
The new breaths of life
Of the tomorrow that you see. Don’t let go...

Looking for a heat that will thaw them out undamaged, for love, my feelings reach out blindly
While I am imprisoned by the sin of doubting the artificial smiles.

I made the decision to go before I am stained.
In the water that will spill and disperse before long, so brilliantly,
If you can see your heart’s reflection,
In exchange for the song that comes to an end...

If you can believe in the illusion
That is dyed in violent color,
Displaying it for all to see,
Perhaps you can surpass even truth.

Stop the ever-flowing passage of time.
Know not even the method to decay.
Those hands of yours that spill blood
Will present to you
The loneliness of a caged life. I wish...

Pressed under every brief and fleeting dream,
The flower becomes a piece of eternity.
The deception, ever so painfully,
Cuts deeply into the world that rejects it.

If you wish, I’ll let you captivate me,
So don’t fade into the distance and disappear.
I’ll greet with open arms
The new breaths of life
Of the tomorrow that you see. Don’t let go...
