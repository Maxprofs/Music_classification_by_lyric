                        Bài hát : Holy Grail - Justin Timberlake

ou take the clothes off my back
And I let you
You'd steal the food right out my mouth
And I'd watch you eat it
I still don't know why
Why I love you so much
Oh
(Thanks for warning me [2x])
You curse my name
In spite to put me to shame
Have my laundry in the streets
Dirty or clean
Give it up for fame
But I still don't know why
Why I love it so much
(Thanks for warning me [2x])
Yeah

[Hook:]
And baby
It's amazing I'm in this maze with you
I just can't crack your code
One day you screaming you love me loud
The next day you're so cold
One day you're here, one day you're there, one day you care
You're so unfair sipping from your cup
Till it runneth over, Holy Grail

[Bridge: Justin Timberlake]
And we all just entertainers
And we're stupid, and contagious
Now we all just entertainers

[Hook: Justin Timberlake]

[Hook: Justin Timberlake]

[Bridge]
You get the air out my lungs whenever you need it
And you take the blade right out my heart just so you can watch me bleed
And I still don’t know why
Why I love you so much
(Thanks for warning me )
Yeah
(Thanks for warning me)
And you play this game in spite to drive me insane
I got it tattooed on my sleeve forever in ink with guess whose name
But I still don't know why
Why I love it so much, yeah.
(Thanks for warning me [2x])

[Hook]

Don't know why...
