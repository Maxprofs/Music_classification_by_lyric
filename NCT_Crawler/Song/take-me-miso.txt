                        Bài hát: Take Me - miso

Do you have something to say
Cos the feelings
in my mind cannot escape
Would you ever take me
Cause my heart is all I carry
The feelings in my mind
I cannot explain
Far away there's places to see
All the worries
and the lies cannot see me
Could you ever take me
Cause my heart is all I carry
The feelings in my mind
I cannot explain
Maybe we need some time
to mend this broken trust
I don't want this to end
and fade to dust
Baby we need some time
to focus it on us
I really want us
to start up this trust
20 days and I don't know
what pace this is
If I could read your mind
would you notice it
Discolour all the worries
find the right exit
I promise not to hide
I give you full permit
I'm understanding
that you wanna be good friends
A very special timing
we can alternate
I'll be right there
Do more than care
Oh I know what I want is
to speed it up with you
I know i'm a girl
but not the average kind
You saying all these aimless
things
i'm not surprised
But i'm infatuated
by the way you smile
I don't need a man to complete me
Strong like a diamond
you can't break me
But you could be my pearl king
I could be your diamond queen
Maybe we need some time
to mend this broken trust
I don't want this to end
and fade to dust
Baby we need some time
to focus it on us
I really want us
to start up this trust
Start up this trust
Focus it on us
Start up this trust
