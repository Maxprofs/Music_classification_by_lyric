                        Time to wake up
 Don't know what to wear
 Do my make-up
 Then I brush my hair
 Read the first scene
 As I paint my nails
 And suddenly my heart starts beating
 I think I need some air Little frightening
 As the lights go down
 Almost showtime
 Curtains opening now
 Spotlight hits you
 I lose all my lines
 And once again my heart starts beating
 I think I need some air to start breathing I'm getting butterflies
 I'm floating on a dream
 Now my world starts spinning
 My heart pounds
 So happy that I could cry
 When I look in your eyes
 Cause you keep giving me
 Keep giving me butterflies Intermission
 Love scenes coming up
 I am shaking
 As the symphony erupts
 Will I make it
 Or will I fall apart
 And once again my heart starts beating
 I think I need some air to start breathing I'm getting butterflies
 I'm floating on a dream
 Now my world starts spinning
 My heart pounds
 So happy that I could cry
 When I look in your eyes
 Cause you keep giving me
 Keep giving me butterflies I'm feeling terrified
 No control
 And now my world is shaking
 The curtains close
 And it tingles and tickles inside of my ??? I'm getting butterflies
 I'm floating on a dream
 Now my world starts spinning
 My heart pounds
 So happy that I could cry
 When I look in your eyes
 Cause you keep giving me
 Keep giving me I'm getting butterflies
 I'm floating on a dream
 Now my world starts spinning
 My heart pounds
 So happy that I could cry
 When I look in your eyes
 Cause you keep giving me, keep
 Cause you keep giving me
 Keep giving me butterflies
