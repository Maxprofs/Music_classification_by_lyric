- just west-

This has been no walk in the park
I feel like we have fallen apart
Open up your eyes girl and see how wonderful
This love could be

CHORUS
Hold on tight
It’s a roller coaster ride we're on so
Say goodbye
Cause I won't be back again
Up and down you're all around
Say goodnight and goodbye
Say goodnight and goodbye
la la la la la la la la la
You say you didn’t mean to break my heart
But girl you did but I’m over it
Adieu to you and all your games
And all you crazy friends
This is the end
Hold on tight
It’s a roller coaster ride we're on so
Say goodbye
Cause I won't be back again
Up and down you're all around
Say goodnight and goodbye
la la la la la la la la la
Well girl
I’m sorry for disappointing you
But I’m done
With being up and down and pushed around
No more
Hold on tight
It’s a roller coaster ride we're on so
Say goodbye
Cause I won't be back again
Up and down you're all around
Say goodnight and goodbye
Hold on tight
It’s a roller coaster ride we're on so
Say goodbye
Cause I won't be back again
Up and down you're all around
Say goodnight and goodbye
                        
                    |
