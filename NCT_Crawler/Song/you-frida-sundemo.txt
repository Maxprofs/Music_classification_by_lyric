                        Bài hát: You - Frida Sundemo

It's all about you-uuu 
It's all about you-uuu 
It's all about you-uuu 
And you are starbright
It's all about you-uuu
It's all about you-uuu
It's all about you-uuu
And you are starbright

I see you reaching out
I know you more than anyone
Every day from now,
I'll be here to let you glow
Oh, there's a fire in your eyes
It's lighting up the darkest night,
So glow, glow
Glow, glow

It's all about you-uuu
It's all about you-uuu
It's all about you-uuu
And you are starbright
It's all about you-uuu
It's all about you-uuu
It's all about you-uuu
And you are starbright

I'm home inside your mind,
And I know every line in your hand
The breathing in my lungs
Is all the air I need
Oh, you've got firework in your eyes
It's lighting up the darkest night,
So glow, glow
Glow, glow

It's all about you-uuu
It's all about you-uuu
It's all about you-uuu
And you are starbright
It's all about you-uuu
It's all about you-uuu
It's all about you-uuu
And you are starbright

So glow, glow
'Cause you are starbright
Now glow, glow
Glow 'cause you are starbright
It's all about you-uuu
It's all about you-uuu
It's all about you-uuu
And you are starbright
                        
                    |
