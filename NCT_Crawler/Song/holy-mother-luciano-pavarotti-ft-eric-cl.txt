                        Eric Clapton:
 Holy Mother, where are you?
 Tonight I feel broken in two.
 I've seen the stars fall from the sky.
 Holy mother, can't keep from crying. Oh I need your help this time,
 Get me through this lonely night.
 Tell me please which way to turn
 To find myself again. Holy mother, hear my prayer,
 Somehow I know you're still there.
 Send me please some peace of mind;
 Take away this pain. I can't wait, I can't wait, I can't wait any longer.
 I can't wait, I can't wait, I can't wait for you. Luciano Pavarotti:
 Holy mother, hear my cry,
 I've cursed your name a thousand times.
 I've felt the anger running through my soul;
 All I need is a hand to hold. Oh I feel the end has come,
 No longer my legs will run.
 You know I would rather be
 In your arms tonight. Eric Clapton:
 When my hands no longer play, Luciano Pavarotti:
 My voice is still, I fade away. Both:
 Holy mother, then I'll be Eric Clapton:
 Lying in, Luciano Pavarotti:
 safe within your Both:
 arms. Luciano Pavarotti:
 Holy mother, hear my cry!
 (Holy mother, hear my cry!)
 Holy mother, hear my cry!
 (Holy mother, hear my cry!)
 Holy mother, hear my cry!
 (Holy mother, hear my cry!)
 Holy mother, hear my cry!
