                        Bài hát: X-Kid - Green Day

Hey, little kid
did you wake up late one day?
You're not so young, but you're still dumb
and you're numb to your old glory,
but now it's gone.

I fell in love,
but it didn't catch your fall.
Then I crashed, to a wall
Then I fell to pieces on the floor.
Now you're sick to death.

Bombs away!
Here goes nothing, the shouting's over.
Hey X-Kid, bombs away!
Here goes nothing, the shouting's over and out,
over and out again.

I once was old enough to know better
then I was too young to care.
but who cares?
I probably would but Hollywood is dead and gone

You fell in love,
but then you just fell apart.
Like a kick in the head,
you're an X-Kid and you
never even got started again.

Bombs away!
Here goes nothing, the shouting's over.
Hey X-Kid, bombs away!
Here goes nothing, the shouting's over and out,
over and out...

And you were searching your soul
and you got lost and out of control.
You went over the edge of joking,
died of a broken heart!

Hey, little kid
did you wake up late one day?
You're not so young, but you're still dumb.
You're an X-kid and you never even got started again.

Bombs away!
Here goes nothing, the shouting's over.
Hey X-Kid, bombs away!
Here goes nothing, the shouting's over.

Hey X-Kid, bombs away!
Here goes nothing, the shouting's over.

Hey X-Kid, bombs away!
Here goes nothing, the shouting's over and out,
over and out,
over and over and out!
                        
                    |
