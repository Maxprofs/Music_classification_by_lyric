                        Bài hát: Halo - The Pussycat Dolls

I can make love feel just like heaven 
I can be a little devil in bed and
Even clean and cook your breakfast
But am not perfect
I can take off when you need my time
I can cheerlead for you from the sideline
Whisper in your ear so divine 
But am not perfect

[Chorus]
I beg you for forgiveness for all of the mistakes I’ve made
Be patient with me baby am just trying to make my way
Am not a super hero sorry I couldn’t save your day....
But believe me when I say.....
That am sorry I couldn’t wear your halo, halo, halo, halo
Am sorry I couldn’t be your angel, angel, angel, angel
Am sorry I couldn’t wear your halo, halo, halo, halo
Am sorry I didn’t stroke your ego, ego, ego oh no
Yes baby but I guess wasn’t able
Sorry I couldn’t wear your halo

I know how to put your mind at easy
I can kiss you for all four season 
Surprise you for no reason
But am not perfect.....no
Fall on my knees and pray for our love
Promise not to let anything come between us
How could you let us fall apart all because....am not perfect

[Chorus]
I beg you for forgiveness for all of the mistakes I’ve made
Be patient with me baby am just trying to make my way
Am not a super hero sorry I couldn’t save your day....
But believe me when I say.....
That am sorry I couldn’t wear your halo, halo, halo, halo
Am sorry I couldn’t be your angel, angel, angel, angel
Am sorry I couldn’t wear your halo, halo, halo, halo
Am sorry I didn’t stroke your ego, ego, ego oh no
Yes baby but I guess wasn’t able
Sorry I couldn’t wear your halo
(Sorry I couldn’t wear your halo) (Halo, halo)

It was like you never knew my heart...
I swear sometimes you are so hard on me
Cause am not everything that u want me to beeeeeeee
Am soooooo sorry, I didn’t want you to see me this wayyyyyy
Am soooooo sorry, I didn’t mean to fall from grace
I didn’t mean to fall from grace!!!!!!

Am sorry I couldn’t wear your halo, halo, halo, halo
Am sorry I couldn’t be your angel, angel, angel, angel
Am sorry I couldn’t wear your halo, halo, halo, halo
Am sorry I didn’t stroke your ego, ego, ego oh no
Yes baby but I guess wasn’t able
Sorry I couldn’t wear your halo
