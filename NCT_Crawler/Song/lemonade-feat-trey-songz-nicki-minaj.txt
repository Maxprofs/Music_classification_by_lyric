                        Better than the rest its the bester
Only cuz they expect nothing lesser (chuh)
And everytime I rap dont you know i put em on (on on on)
I run the web like spiderman and u niggas is venom
Call me radio cuz thats exactly what i been on
Fresh as watermelon so they sour like a lemon
Lookin for my baby im just trynna get my slim on
First is on roids 
I been trynna get my gym on
Notoriously big so she trynna get her kim on (on on on what! cum her)
i aint the one to front on yo cd is probably what niggas break they blunt on she on it riding
You call her tell her come home put it silent then she got her dumb on head gone come on

*chorus*
Trigga hit the stage with a fresh cut
Jeezy hit the stage and the sets up
Jigga hit the stage and the crowd go crazy, im thinking got damn i made it
But still im on grind like some bad breaks
Cuz i remember the time i was last place
I tell you im the illest, imma drill to you feel it
Never had to tell me (get up off ya ass Trey)

Brown butts no ash tray

05 no lie livin lavida loca

and i aint even wore em

I heard the weekend scary
whispering like wish it scary
Scream
You niggas age like country ham
Im out of this world, your stuck in one country damn
I give you the benni thats short for the benefit
Im goin hard cuz they all temidness
I bend the *
Now we know i aint invent the * 
But im the only one who could sing it just like i meant the *
Got the truck take the whip thinking about the money that im fend to get
So dont get in my way 
No one's exempt to this

*chorus*
