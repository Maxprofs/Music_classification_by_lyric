This is really one of my dumbest flows ever
I haven't slept in days
And me and my latest girl agreed
to go our separate ways
so I'm single'
Thinking about what we had and missing you
But I ain't Santa, I got something for these bad bitches too
I mean paparazzi on me trying not to get caught out
they always seem to catch me with the women that I brought out
Baby don't hold on too long cause that's how them stories start out
And all the girls that played me
eat your mother***ing heart out, it's Drizzy'
Always gone but never hard to find
And since you can't escape me do i ever cross your mind'
Because all this *** is new to me
I'm learning to behave
and still spending every dollar they
encouraged me to save
but I'm good'
I know that niggas would kill for this lifestyle
I'm looking forward to the memories of last now
Never forgetting from where I came
And no matter where I'm headed I promise
to stay the same
I'm just...

I'm just riding 'round the city with my hood up and my windows down

Ask you're girl, I'm the realest nigga she's been around

When I pull up in something new and park it by the haters

And when you get to talking about the greatest
I just really hope that you'
('that you think of me)

I just really hope that(You think of me)

I'm doing my thing (x3)(I'm just trying to be unforgettable')
This just be my realest flow ever
When I say for life, y'all say forever
It's hard but it's fair, I told that girl life hurts
The closest you're gonna get to this is a Pac t-shirt
The name's 'Young' baby, you know I live that thug life
The good die young so I'm gonna need a thug wife
Yeah, I'm talking His & Her's firearms
Know that our jewelry probably louder than a car's alarm
Yeah, I remember I used to have to sneak the car
Now my insides looking like a Snickers bar
Yeah, I'm talking caramel leathers
Damn right, so fly I need feathers
She said:I'm "Still In the streets, so what's the dealy'"
Young's done everything in the A but *** Chilly
So welcome to my life, no two days the same
Life for y'all to meet the love of my life
Her name's the game
I just really hope that you'('that you think of me)
I just really hope that('that you think of me)
