(No, nothing good starts in a getaway car)

He was the best of times, the worst of crimes
I struck a match and blew your mind
But I didn't mean it
And you didn't see it
The ties were black, the lies were white
The shades of grey in candlelight
I wanted to leave him
I needed a reason

X marks the spot, where we fell apart
He poisoned the well, I was lyin' to myself
I knew it from the first old fashion, we were cursed
We never had a shotgun shot in the dark

You were drivin' the getaway car
We were flyin', but we'd never get far
Don't pretend it's such a mystery
Think about the place where you first met me
We're ridin' in a getaway car
There were sirens in the beat of your heart
Shoulda know I'd be the first to leave
Think about the place where you first met me
In a getaway car
No, we never get far
No, nothing good starts in a getaway car

He was the great escape, the prison break
The light of freedom on my face
But you weren't thinkin'
And I was just drinkin'
While he was runnin' after us, I was screamin', "go, go, go!"
But with three of us, honey, it's a side show
And a circus ain't a love story
And now we're both sorry (we're both sorry)

X marks the spot, where we fell apart
He poisoned the well, every man for himself
I knew it from the first old fashion, we were cursed
It hit you like a shotgun shot in the heart

You were drivin' the getaway car
We were flyin', but we'd never get far
Don't pretend it's such a mystery
Think about the place where you first met me
Ridin' in a getaway car
There were sirens in the beat of your heart
Shoulda know I'd be the first to leave
Think about the place where you first met me
In a getaway car
No, we never get far
No, nothing good starts in a getaway car

We were jet-set, Bonnie and Clyde
Until I switch to the other side
To the other side
It's no surprise I turned you in
'Cause us traitors never win
I'm in a getaway car
I left you in a motel bar
Put the money in the bag and I stole the keys
That was the last time you ever saw me

Drivin' the getaway car
We were flyin', but we never get far (don't pretend)
Don't pretend it's such a mystery
Think about the place where you first met me
We're ridin' in a getaway car
There were sirens in the beat of your heart
Shoulda know I'd be the first to leave
Think about the place where you first met me
In a getaway car
No, we never get far
No, nothing could stops in a getaway car

I was flyin' in a getaway car
I was cryin' in a getaway car
I was dyin' in a getaway car
Said goodbye in a getaway car
I was flyin' in a getaway car
I was cryin' in a getaway car
I was dyin' in a getaway car
Said goodbye in a getaway car
                        
                    |
