                        Bài hát: Beat Of My Drum - Powers

All day I was out
Falling, thinking about you
Buzzing by myself tonight
Same place, same old rhyme
Same troubles on my mind too
I still changed and don't know why
Forever and ever you'd never believe
For better or worse this is all just a dream
Whenever the pressure get you on your knees
Just take it or leave it as long as you're free

Cut me loose, putting my, putting my hands up
Move your shoes to the beat of my, beat of my drum
Hallelujia, baby now, baby now stand up
Making moves, to the beat of my, beat of my drum
To the beat of my, beat of my
To the beat of my, beat of my drum
To the beat of my, beat of my
To the beat of my, beat of my drum
To the beat of my, beat of my
To the beat of my, beat of my drum
To the beat of my, beat of my
To the beat of my, beat of my drum

One day I realized
I'm never satisfied
I'm too drunk on this lullaby
Forever and ever will never accrue
While everyone's ending is always too soon
Remember whenever you're black and you're blue
Don't fake it to feel it whatever you do

Cut me loose, putting, putting my hands up
Move your shoes to the beat of my, beat of my drum
High and low, baby now, baby now stay alive
Making moves, to the beat of my, beat of my drum
To the beat of my, beat of my
To the beat of my, beat of my drum
To the beat of my, beat of my
To the beat of my, beat of my drum
To the beat of my, beat of my
To the beat of my, beat of my drum
To the beat of my, beat of my
To the beat of my, beat of my drum1

Glowing, glowing up to deep end
Preaching, preaching out to masses
Hoping, hoping I'll see you again

Cut me loose, putting, putting my hands up
Move your shoes to the beat of my, beat of my drum
High and low, baby now, baby now stay alive
Making moves, to the beat of my, beat of my drum
To the beat of my, beat of my
To the beat of my, beat of my drum
To the beat of my, beat of my
To the beat of my, beat of my drum
To the beat of my, beat of my
To the beat of my, beat of my drum
To the beat of my, beat of my
To the beat of my, beat of my drum
