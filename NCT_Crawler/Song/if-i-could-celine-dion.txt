                        If I could, I'd protect you
 From the sadness in your eyes
 Give you courage in a world of compromise
 Yes, I would If I could, I would teach you
 All the things I've never learned
 And I'd help you cross the bridges that I've burned
 Yes, I would If I could, I would try to shield
 Your innocence from time
 But a part of life I gave you isn't mine
 I've watched you grow, so I could let you go If I could, I would help you
 Make it through the hungry years
 But I know that I can never cry your tears
 But I would, if I could If I live in a time and place where you don't want to be
 You don't have to walk along this road with me
 My yesterday won't have to be your way If I knew, I would try to change
 The world I brought to you to
 And there isn't very much that I, I could do
 But I would, if I could Oh baby, mummy wants to protect you
 And help my baby through the hungry years
 It's part of And if you ever, ever need
 Sad shoulder to cry on
 I'm just someone to talk to
 I'll be there, I'll be there I didn't change your world
 But I would, if I could Oh darling, I love you baby
