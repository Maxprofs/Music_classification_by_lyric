                        Bài hát: Titanium Cover - J.Fla

You shout it loud but I can't hear a word you say 
I'm talking loud not saying much 
I'm criticized but all your bull is brick of shame 
You shoot me down but I get up 
I'm bulletproof nothing to lose 
fire away... fire away 
Brick of shame, you take your rain 
Fire away... fire away 
You shoot me down but I won't fall 
I am titanium 
You shoot me down but I won't fall 
I am titanium...I am titanium... 
Cut me down, but is you who had offered there to fall 
Ghost town, haunted love 
Raise your voice, sticks and stones may break my bones 
I'm talking loud not saying much 
I' m bulletproof nothing to lose 
Fire away... fire away 
Brick of shame, you take your rain 
Fire away... fire away 
You shoot me down but I won't fall 
I am titanium 
You shoot me down but I won't fall 
I am titanium... I am titanium... 
Stone-hard, machine gun 
Firing at the ones who rise 
Stone-hard, thus bulletproof 
You shoot me down but I won't fall 
I am titanium 
You shoot me down but I won't fall 
I am titanium 
You shoot me down but I won't fall 
I am titanium 
You shoot me down but I won't fall 
I am titanium...
