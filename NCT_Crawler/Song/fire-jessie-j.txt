                        Bài hát: Fire - Jessie J

He is the flame
He draws me in
That burns within
It's a pain, it's so sweet, oh
The fix, the craze, by now he needs
Only I can't breathe
And I just can't pull away
Can't get away, oh, oh

From the fire, fire, fire
I never wanna put it out
Burning, burning, burning
Fire, fire, fire
I never wanna put it out
Burning, burning, burning

My hands they're burnt, they're black, they bleed
And embers asleep
My whole world is cold now
The blaze, the heat he's putting out
Can't live without
Yeah, I just can't pull away,
Can't get away, oh, oh

From the fire, fire, fire
I never wanna put it out
Burning, burning, burning
From the fire, fire, fire
I never wanna put it out
Burning, burning, burning

Oh
Oh
Oh
Whoa

Fire (fire)
Fire (ooh)
Fire (fire) Oh

Burning my soul now
My soul now
My soul now (soul now)
My soul now (soul now)
My soul now (soul now)
My soul now (soul now)
My soul now (soul now), Oh

From the fire, fire, fire
I never wanna put it out
Burning, burning, burning

Oh
Oh
Oh
Whoah

Oh
Oh
Oh
Whoah
