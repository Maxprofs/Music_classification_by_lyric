                        Bài hát: Flipside - Norah Jones

[Verse 1]
Trying to get high, but you wanted me low
Good things are happening, but happen slow
Some kind of mystery from long ago

I finally know who I'm supposed to be
My mind was locked but I found the key
Hope it don't ever slip away from me
[Pre-Chorus]
Raw times, fun lines
Moments pass by and I cry
Rewind, step behind
It's hard to find the flipside

[Chorus]
I can't stand when you tell me to get back
We're all free, why don't you see we can't just be

[Verse 2]
I saw your reflection all over on the news
Your temperature's well past a hundred and two
Put the guns away, or we'll all lose

[Pre-Chorus]
Stand by, or take flight
Eat or throw your piece by
Walk on, or be mine
Moments fly by and I cry

[Chorus]
I can't stand when you tell me to get back
We're free, why don't you see we can't just be
I can't stand when you tell me to get back
We're free, why don't you see we can't just be
                        
                    |
