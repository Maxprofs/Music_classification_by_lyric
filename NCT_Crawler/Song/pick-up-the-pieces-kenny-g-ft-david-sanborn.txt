Money Mark - Pick Up The Pieces
《Brand New by Tomorrow》

Too many sorries went around
And he became a familiar sound
Got so tired of the melody
Melodies were meant to be free
You got me picking up all my pieces
Put them back in my pocket
In case I need them
Hoping it's not if but when
Hoping it's not so much later but so soon
Oh

When we last talked we didn't expect a thing
Couldn't believe but your love did sting
If I found myself walking backwards into you
Would you spill out all your memories too
We're picking up all our pieces
Put them back in our pockets and just leave them
Hoping it's not if but when
Hoping the same old melody will feel new
Oh
