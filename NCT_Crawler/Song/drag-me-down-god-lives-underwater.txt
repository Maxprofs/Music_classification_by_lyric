                        Bài hát: Drag Me Down - God Lives Underwater

You don't know me
Think you can judge me
Budge me rape me
Love me

You wait for me to
Just believe you
Like all the times before
I was young then

Ask for it again
I feel the sweat in my eyes
How could you treat me
Just like a child when

I couldn't even realize
Do you love me
Do you need me
Maybe someday

Yeah
Do you please me
So I'll please you
Don't drag me

Don't you drag me down
Now I know you
Think that I love you
Trust you want you

Don't you
You want me to
Be free to
Say anything on my mind

I can't understand
Why another man
Wouldn't leave you alone
Maybe they don't

See what I see
I hope you're left on your own
                        
                    |
