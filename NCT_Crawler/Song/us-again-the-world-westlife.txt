                        Song: Us Again The World - Westlife

You and I, we’ve been at it so long
I still got the strongest fire
You and I, we still know how to talk 
know how to walk that wire

Sometimes I feel like the world is against me
The sound of your voice baby that’s what saves me
When we’re together I feel so invincible

Chorus
‘Cause it’s us against the world
You and me against them all
If you’re listening to these words
Know that we are standing tall
I don’t ever see the day that I won’t catch you when you fall
‘Cause it’s us against the world tonight


Verse 2
There’ll be days we’ll be on different sides
But that doesn’t last too long 
We find ways to get it on track
We know how to turn back on

Sometimes I feel I can’t keep it together
then you hold me close and you make it better
When I’m with you I can feel so unbreakable 

Chorus

Bridge
We’re not gonna break ‘cause we both still believe
We know what we’ve got and we’ve got what we need alright 
We’re doing something right

Chorus x2
                        
                    |
