                        Bài hát: Fine By Me - Chris Brown

[Chris Brown]
She doesn't call before midnight
If at all
Oh
She never stays to watch the night turn to day...

But I'm like use me baby, anyway you want
I wish you were mine in the broad daylight
But you just use me baby, anyway you want

I wish you were mine but!


She only loves me when the lights are off, lights are off
She only loves me when the sun is down, sun is down
She only loves me when no one's around, one's around
She only loves me cause I put it down

And it's fine by me...
And it's fine by me...

She's like the wind, she comes
And goes and again
All of my friends think I'm a fool
Silly them

But I'm like use me baby, anyway you want
I wish you were mine in the broad daylight
But you just use me baby, anyway you want
I wish you were mine but

She only loves me when the lights are off
Lights are off
She only loves me when the sun is down
Sun is down
She only loves me when no one's around
One's around
She only loves me cause I put it down

And that's fine by me...
And that's fine by me...

She knows I can take her there
(afterwards she just don't care)
She knows I can take her there
(afterwards she just don't care)

She only loves me when the lights are off, lights are off
She only loves me when the sun is down, sun is down
She only loves me when no one's around, one's around
She only loves me cause I put it down
You a freak, and it's fine by me
You a freak, and it's fine by me
And it's fine by me
And it's fine by me
And it's fine by me
