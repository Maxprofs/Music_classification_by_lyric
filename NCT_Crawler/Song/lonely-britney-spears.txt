To think I am so naive
How dare you play with me
I gave you heart and soul yeah
Tell me baby please
Why you screwing with my head
I dont think you understand
I wont take your (Gasp) No more
Dont knock on my door
Not this time because I recognize
I have heard it all before and I E I I
Think of all the time that I have wasted
Think of all the times that I took you back
Aint no way I will be lonely
I dont wanna let you back in
Lets just face it (face it)
Better off alone and I wont turn back
Thought that I would be lonely
I dont wanna let you back in
Dont tell me how to feel
Or say that you are for real
My mind is made up
I am cool without you
You got no more appeal
Now this girl dont need no man
Says what she can do what she can
Now I live for me
Boy does that make you weep
Not this time because I realise
I have heard it all before and I E I I
I think of all the time that I have wasted
I think of all the times that I took you back
Aint no way I will be lonely
I dont wanna let you back in
Lets just face it (face it)
Better off alone and I wont turn back
Thought that I would be lonely
I dont wanna let you back in
Think of times you made me cry
I am tired of trying to leave behind this
What is A Girl To Do
Think of all the times you made me sick
I used to think I couldnt handle it
What you think I am just another chick
Lost your grip Boy you must have tripped
What were you thinking when you lost my trust
You had it all and now your left with nothing
Oh baby now I know you want my touch
And now your Lonely and you still want me
Think of all the time that I have wasted
Think of all the times that I took you back
Aint no way I will be lonely
I dont wanna let you back in
Lets just face it (Face it)
Better off alone and I wont turn back
Thought that I would be lonely
I dont wanna let you back in
Think of all the time that I have wasted
Think of all the times that I took you back
Aint no way I will be lonely
I dont wanna let you back in
Lets just face it (Face it)
Better off alone and I wont turn back
Thought that I would be lonely
I dont wanna let you back in
