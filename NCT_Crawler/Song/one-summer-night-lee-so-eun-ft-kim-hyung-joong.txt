                        One summer night
the stars were shining bright
One summer dream
made with fancy whims
That summer night
my whole world tumbled down
I could have died if not for you

Each night I pray for you
My heart would cry for you
The sun won't shine again
since you have gone
Each time I think of you
My heart would beat for you
You are the one for me

Set me free
like the sparrows up the tree
Give a sign so I would ease my mind
Just say a word
And I'll come running wild
Give me a chance to live again

Each night I pray for you
My heart would cry for you
The sun won't shine again
since you have gone
Each time I think of you
My heart would beat for you
You are the one for me

One summer night
the stars were shining bright
One summer dream
made with fancy whims
That summer night
my whole world tumbled down
I could have died if not for you

Each night I pray for you
My heart would cry for you
The sun won't shine again
since you have gone
Each time I think of you
My heart would beat for you
You are the one for me
                        
                    |
