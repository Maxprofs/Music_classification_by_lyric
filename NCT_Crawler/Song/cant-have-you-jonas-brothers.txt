                        You've warned me that you were gonna leave
 I never thought that you would really go
 I was blind but baby now I see
 Broke your heart but now I know That I was being such a fool
 And I didn't deserve you I don't wanna fall asleep
 'Cause I don't know if I'll get up
 And I don't wanna cause a scene
 But I'm dying without your love Begging to hear your voice
 Tell me you love me too
 'Cause I'd rather just be alone
 If I know that I can't have you Looking at the letter that you left
 (The letter that you left, will I ever get you back?)
 Wondering if I'll ever get you back
 (Ooh ah, ooh ah, ooh ah, ooh ah) Dreaming about when I'll see you next
 (When will I see you next? Will I ever get you back?)
 Knowing that I never will forget
 (I won't forget, I won't forget) That I was being such a fool
 And I still don't deserve you I don't wanna fall asleep
 'Cause I don't know if I'll get up
 And I don't wanna cause a scene
 'Cause I'm dying without your love, yeah Begging to hear your voice
 Tell me you love me too
 'Cause I'd rather just be alone
 If I know that I can't have you So tell me what we're fighting for
 'Cause we know that the truth means so much more
 'Cause you would if you could, don't lie 'Cause I'll give everything that I've got left
 To show you I mean what I have said
 I know I was such a fool but I can't live without you I don't wanna fall asleep
 Don't know if I'll get up
 I don't wanna cause a scene
 But I'm dying without your love I'm begging to hear your voice
 Tell me you love me too
 'Cause I'd rather just be alone
 If I know that I can't have you, yeah Don't wanna fall asleep
 (Don't wanna fall asleep)
 'Cause I don't know if I'll get up
 (Who knows if I'll get up)
 I don't wanna cause a scene
 'Cause I'm dying without your love, yeah I'm begging to hear your voice
 (Let me hear your voice)
 Tell me you love me too
 (Tell me you love me too)
 'Cause I'd rather just be alone
 If I know that I can't have you
