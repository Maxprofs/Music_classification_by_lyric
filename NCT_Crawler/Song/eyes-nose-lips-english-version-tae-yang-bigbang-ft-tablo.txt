                        Bài hát: Eyes, Nose, Lips (English Version) - Tae Yang (BIGBANG), Tablo

You left me paralyzed
No cure no rehab for me
funny that you got the nerve to keep askin me
How I've been
You're the victor in this pageantry
But the trophy you deserve
Catastrophe
I'd rather be to dead to each other
No eulogies said for each other
No rest in peace's 
The memory's got my chest in pieces
I'm prayin that your eyes are the first to go
The way they looked when you smiled
The way they opened and closed
Then your nose
Every single breath against my neck
And then your lips
Every empty promise made and said
Please fade
Fade to black
Please fade
Fade to black
But the nightmare's come back
Because your eyes, nose, lips
Every look and every breath
Every kiss still got me dying
You still got me crying
Because your eyes, nose, lips
Every look and every breath
Every kiss still got me dying
You still got me crying
Forget the promenade
Let's juggernaut down memory lane
Leave no thought alive
To the slaughterhouse
I'm talking my pain
It's time to sever my brain from my heart and soul
My knees are burning hot
But God is cold
I've been told
One day you'll know too much og heaven's a sin
After the show it's only hell that is brings
So take it slow and let time heal everything
They say that time flies
But you keep breaking its wings
You'll never fade
Fade to black
Please fade
Fade to black
But the nightmare's come back
Because your eyes, nose, lips
Every look and every breath
Every kiss still got me dying
You still got me crying (x2)
You wish me well
You wish me well
I wish you hell
I never wanna look into your eyes aigain. No
I never wanna hear you breathe again
Let me go. Let me go
Baby tell me this is the end
Because your eyes, nose, lips
Every look and every breath
Every kiss still got me dying
You still got me crying (x2)
Cry cry crying...
                        
                    |
