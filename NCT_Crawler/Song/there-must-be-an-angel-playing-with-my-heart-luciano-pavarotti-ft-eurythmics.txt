                        No one on earth could feel like this
 Im thrown and overblown with bliss
 There must be an Angel
 Playing with my heart I walk into an empty room
 And suddenly my heart goes boom
 Its an orchestra of Angels
 And theyre playing with my heart Must be talking to an Angel
 Must be talking to an Angel
 Must be talking to an Angel Must be talking to an Angel
 Must be talking to an Angel
 Must be talking to an Angel Must be talking to an Angel
 Must be talking to an Angel
 Must be talking to an Angel Must be talking to an Angel
 Must be talking to an Angel
 Must be talking to an Angel No one on earth could feel like this
 Im thrown and overblown with bliss
 There must be an Angel
 Playing with my heart And when I think that Im alone
 It seems theres more of us at home
 Its a multitude of Angels
 And theyre playing with my heart Must be talking to an Angel
 Must be talking to an Angel
 Must be talking to an Angel Must be talking to an Angel
 Must be talking to an Angel
 Must be talking to an Angel Must be talking to an Angel
 Must be talking to an Angel
 Must be talking to an Angel Must be talking to an Angel
 Must be talking to an Angel
 Must be talking to an Angel I must be hallucinating
 Watching Angels celebrating
 Could this be activating
 All my senses dislocating? This must be a strange deception
 By celestial intervention
 Leaving me the recollection
 Of your Heavenly connection No one on earth could feel like this
 Im thrown and overblown with bliss
 There must be an Angel
 Playing with my heart And when I think that Im alone
 It seems theres more of us at home
 Its a multitude of Angels
 And theyre playing with my heart
