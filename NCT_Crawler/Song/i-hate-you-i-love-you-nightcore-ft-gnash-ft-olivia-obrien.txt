                        Bài hát: I Hate You I Love You - Nightcore, Gnash, Olivia O'Brien

Feeling used
But I'm
Still missing you
And I can't

See the end of this
Just wanna feel your kiss
Against my lips
And now all this time

Is passing by
But I still can't seem to tell you why
It hurts me every time I see you
Realize how much I need you

[Đk:]
I hate you, I love you
I hate that I love you
Don't want to but I can't put nobody else above you.

I hate you, I love you
I hate that I want you
You want her, you need her
And I'll never be her.

I miss you when I can't sleep
Or right after coffee
Or right when I can't eat
I miss you in my front seat

Still got sand in my sweaters
From nights we don't remember
Do you miss me like I miss you?
*** around and got attached to you

Friends can break your heart too,and
I'm always tired but never of you
If I pulled a you on you, you wouldn't like that ***
I put this real out, but you wouldn't bite that ***

I type a text but then I nevermind that ***
I got these feelings but you never mind that ***
Oh oh, keep it on the low
You're still in love with me but your friends don't know

If u wanted me you would just say so
And if I were you, I would never let me go

[Đk:]
I hate you, I love you
I hate that I love you
Don't want to but I can't put nobody else above you

I hate you, I love you
I hate that I want you
You want her, you need her
And I'll never be her

All alone I watch you watch her
She's the only thing you've ever seen
How is it you'll never notice
That you are slowly killing me

[Đk:]
I hate you, I love you
I hate that I love you
Don't want to but I can't put nobody else above you

I hate you, I love you
I hate that I want you
You want her, you need her
And I'll never be her
                        
                    |
