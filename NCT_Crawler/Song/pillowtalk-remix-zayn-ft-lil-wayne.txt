                        Bài hát: Pillowtalk Remix - Zayn, Lil Wayne

(Intro – Lil Wayne)
Yeah, pop, pop, pop, pop
Pop, pop, pop, pop
Brrrr
It’s our paradise
Yeah
And it’s our war zone

(Verse 1 – Zayn & Lil Wayne)
Climb on board
Mula baby
We’ll go slow and high tempo
Yeah
Light and dark
Hold me hard and mellow

(Pre Chorus – Zayn & Lil Wayne)
I’m seeing the pain, seeing the pleasure
Nobody but you, body but me
He the one, she the two
Body but us, bodies together
I love to hold you close, tonight and always
I love to wake up next to you
I love to hold you close, tonight and always
I love to wake up next to you

(Chorus – Zayn & Lil Wayne)
So we’ll *** the neighbours
Tunechi baby
In the place that feels the tears
The place to lose your fears
Yeah, reckless behavior
She come to the zoo
A place that is so pure, so dirty and raw
Yeah
In the bed all day, bed all day, bed all day
F**king and fighting on
Pop, pop, pop, pop, brrrr
It’s our paradise and it’s our war zone
Paradise and our war zone
It’s our paradise and it’s our war zone

(Verse 2 – Lil Wayne & Zayn)
Pillow talk
F**king and fighting, f**king and fighting
Yeah, f**k it
If she love it, I like it, husband and wifey
We do what we do
We do how we do but we making it through
And the bedroom a zoo
We fuss for a few, then we f**k for a truce, yeah
She’s something to do when there’s nothing to do
We so ugly and cute, but the love is the proof
Never chucking the deuce, never coming unloose, woo
Put my tongue in her noose, out my thumb in her boose
Make her jump through the roof, now she touching the moon
And she love when we spoon, she gon cum and boo, hoo!
When she cumming it’s through

(Repeat Chorus)

(Verse 3 – Zayn & Lil Wayne)
If anybody knows that’s just how the game goes
In a few weeks she’ll be somebody’s yo
I got too many seeds, they all gotta go
No I didn’t conceive but I got one goal
And yes I felt the seed but I don’t no more
Now I’ll f**k her ten times cause I don’t get bored
Standing in halls where the great men shine
They were your dreams and the reason I mind
You would have held me back and you wouldn’t let me go
You would have told me no, you would have told me yes
Would have stayed the night, then we’d probably have sex
And we know it ain’t right but there’s stuff that comes next
It’s our paradise and our war zone
It’s our paradise and our war zone

(Repeat Chorus)
