                        Song: Tammy - Debbie Reynolds

I hear the cottonwoods whispering above 
Tammy! Tammy! Tammy's in love! 
The old hootie owl hootie-hoo's to the dove 
Tammy! Tammy! Tammy's in love! 
Does my darling feel what I feel 
When he comes near? 
My heart beats so joyfully 
you'd think that he could hear! 
Wish I knew if he knew what I'm dreaming of! 
Tammy! Tammy! Tammy's in love! 

Whippoorwill, whippoorwill, you and I know 
Tammy! Tammy! Can't let him go! 
The breeze from the bayou keeps murmuring low 
Tammy! Tammy! You love him so! 
When the night is warm, soft and warm 
I long for his charms! 
I'd sing like a violin 
if I were in his arms 
Wish I knew if he knew what I'm dreaming of! 
Tammy, Tammy, Tammy's in love!
