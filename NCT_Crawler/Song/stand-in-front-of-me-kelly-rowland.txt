                        He (Said) He said stand in front of me
 Let me pone that ass
 Show em your're my girl
 And let me stay I'll be the king (the king)
 As long as, you stand in front of me
 In front of me, stand in front of me
 In front of me My life's become a fantasy

 Give me the world and here you go
 Just by grabbing my hand (hand)
 Watch you worry puzzles me and I love when you say
 Stand in front of me (in front of me)
 In front of me (in front of me) stand in front of me I was asked something long ago
 And couldn't answer and it bothered me a little
 How do you keep your man
 And I found the best answer, it's simple
 You just do it, do it, mean it, prove it
 That's how you keep your man, how you keep your man,
 How you keep your man, how you keep your man
 Ladies do it, do it, mean it, prove it
 Oh you gotta have a plan, gotta take a chance
 That'll keep your man, that'll keep him saying Stand in front of me
 Let me pone that ass
 Show em your're my girl
 And let me stay I'll be the king (the king)
 As long as, you stand in front of me
 In front of me, stand in front of me
 In front of me So I get down on bended knee
 And grab you by your (hand)
 Your like oh no babe you can't do that
 I'm like oh oh yes I can
 Or we could just go back to cuddling
 Or you could just say stand in front of me (stand in front of me)
 Stand in front of me (stand in front of me)
 Front of me (stand in front of me) I was asked something long ago
 And couldn't answer and it bothered me a little
 How do you keep your man
 And I found the best answer, it's simple
 Do it, do it, mean it, prove it
 That's how you keep your man, how you keep your man,
 How you keep your man, how you keep your man
 Ladies do it, do it, mean it, prove it
 Oh you gotta have a plan, gotta take a chance
 That'll keep your man, that'll keep him saying Stand in front of me
 Let me pone that ass
 Show 'em your're my girl
 And let me stay I'll be the king (the king)
 As long as, you stand in front of me
