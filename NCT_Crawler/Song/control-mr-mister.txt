                        This is about control, it's about vision
 My vision, my mission
 Don't tell me about what you think
 'Cause I don't care, no, I don't care We all want control of our destiny
 We all want control of our lives
 We all want control of each other
 We all see the fear in our eyes An old man was sitting on a corner
 We couldn't remember where he lived
 I felt so sad until he told me
 He knew where he was and that was enough for him We all want control of our destiny
 We all want control of our lives
 We all want control of each other
 We all see the fear in our eyes Open my eyes to it
 I can see that way too
 Open your eyes to it
 You can see that way too We all want control of our destiny
 We all want control of our lives
 We all want control of each other
 We all see the fear in our eyes We all want control
 We all want control
 We all want control
 We all want control
