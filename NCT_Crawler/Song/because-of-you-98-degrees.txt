                        It’s all, it’s all 

Chorus: 
You’re my sunshine after the rain 
You’re the cure against my fear & my pain 
’cause I’m losing my mind 
When you’re not around 
It’s all, it’s all 
It’s all because of you 

You’re my sunshine 
Oh yeah 

Baby I really know by now 
Since we met that day 
You showed me the way 
I felt it then, you gave me love 
I can’t describe 
How much I feel for you 

I said baby i 
Should have known by now 
Should have been right there 
Whenever you gave me love 
And if only you were here 
I’d tell you 
Yes I’d tell you, oh yeah 

Chorus 

Oohh oh yeah yeeaah 

Honestly could you be with me 
Like it was before 
Neither less nor more 
’cause when I close my eyes at night 
I realize that no one else 
Could ever take your place 

I still can feel and it’s so unreal 
When you’re touching me 
Kisses endlessly 
It’s just a place in the sun, 
Where our loves begun 
I miss you, yes I miss you 
Oh baby yeah 

Chorus 

If I knew how to tell you 
What’s on my mind 
Make you understand 
Then I’d always be there 
Right by your side
