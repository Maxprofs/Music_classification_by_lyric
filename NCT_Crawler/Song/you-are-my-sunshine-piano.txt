                        Bài hát: You Are My Sunshine - Piano

You are my sunshine, my only sunshine. 
You make me happy when skies are grey. 
You'll never know dear, how much I love you. 
Please don't take my sunshine away. 

The other night dear, as I lay sleeping, 
I dream I held you in my arms. 
When I awoke dear, I was mistaken, 
So I hung my head and cried. 

You are my sunshine, my only sunshine.
                        
                    |
