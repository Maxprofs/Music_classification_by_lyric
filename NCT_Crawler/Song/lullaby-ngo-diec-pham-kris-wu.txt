[KEVIN:]
Boy we made it now we on it
Think about that time we grindin uh
Nothing’s changed since that night we pieced up lullaby
06 now add a 1 to that
Ten years deep and we still on it
Like we figured look who left on top the two of us
Could you imagine otherwise
All that talk about that life we made it come alive
No regrets or doubts
Once we say we say we do
Now the world behind our views
Seeing the bigger picture man
I knew the end it be the two

[KRIS:]
Ye
End will be the two
You know we got the views
I need some real reviews
Tell me the truth what else I gotta do
Don’t wanna be stayin in the shadow rear mirror view
Bié gàosù wǒ nǐ xiǎng yào de xiǎng zuò de xiǎng shuō de
Wǒ zàihū wǒ xiǎng yào de xiǎng zuò de xiǎngdédào de
Wǒ huózhe jiùshì wèile kàn kàn tiān yǒu duō gāo
Cause we got the sauce and we started from the bottom
Right about now
I’ll smile don’t wanna see u cry
Just sing me a lullaby
I’ll cry for u to see ur smile
This will be my lullaby
I’ll smile don’t wanna see u cry
Just sing me a lullaby
I’ll cry for u to see ur smile
This will be my lullaby
Tāmen shuō wǒmen qíshí dōu shì yīyàng de
Miàn duì jiārén wǒmen biǎoxiàn dōu shì pànnì de
Zhǐyǒu dāng wǒ zhēnzhèng de míngbái
Nǐ de fùchū quándōu shì wèile wǒ jiānglái
Qíshí wǒ yīzhí dōu xiǎng chéngwéi yīgè good boy
Yǒushí bù gǎn huí jiā shì yīn wéi hàipà
Wǒmen de zhēngchǎo huì chíxù mànyán
Wǒ yě hàipà yǒu tiān kàn nǐ bái fà cāngcāng
Duìzhe wǒ wéixiào de liǎn no

[KEVIN:]
Didn’t think a chimney would get me so deep run and chasin’
What seem to be fantasies ain’t wasted
Look at time fly by tick the clock counter-wise
Now is just a moment caught picture perfect god
Man patience u said was a virtue
Maybe that’s why the fire never dimmed and pursued
Into something even God himself couldn’t presume
But thanks to you I stand here the dream continues

KRIS:
I’ll smile don’t wanna see u cry
Just sing me a lullaby
I’ll cry for u to see ur smile
This will be my lullaby
I’ll smile don’t wanna see u cry
Just sing me a lullaby
I’ll cry for u to see ur smile
This will be my lullaby
I’ll smile don’t wanna see u cry
Just sing me a lullaby
I’ll cry for u to see ur smile
This will be my lullaby
I’ll smile don’t wanna see u cry
Just sing me a lullaby
I’ll cry for u to see ur smile
This will be my lullaby
