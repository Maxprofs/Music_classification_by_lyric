                        Always on my mind
Always in my heart
I’ve been waiting for you night after night
Like a shadow, staying close to the light
Suddenly, you stand beside me
And I see a million burning stars
You are always on my mind
Always in my heart
And I can hear you call my name on a mountain high
Always on my mind
Always in my dreams
I wanna hold you close with me
Always, all the time
I believe I’m addicted to you
In your eyes I see dreams coming true
Finally I have found you
And now I will never let you go, no
You are always on my mind
Always in my heart
And I can hear you call my name on a mountain high
Always on my mind
Always in my dreams
I wanna hold you close with me
Always, all the time
Always on my mind
Always in my heart
And I can hear you call my name on a mountain high
Always on my mind, always in my dreams
I wanna hold you close with me
Always, all the time
Always on my mind
Always in my heart
Always on my mind
Always in my dreams
Always, all the time
