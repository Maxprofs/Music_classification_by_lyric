                        Bài hát: Friend Zone - The Janoskians

I know a girl wants to be my friend,
She's a 10, and I don't want to be her friend
Cause I want something more in the end, in the end

I wanna tell her

Your my American pie and I really, really wanna piece,
Cause you, keep my adrenaline high, and I'm never getting over this,
And now I'm singin'

Your in somebody else's bed,
You say you want me there instead,
You keep on messin' with my head,
When we get close to the end zone,
You put me back in the friend zone,
Hey, yeah, you put me back in the friend zone,
Hey, yeah, you put me back in the friend zone.

You got me sprung like a spring girl,
You got me photo for the ring girl,
Give me a shot and a mean girl,
But you ain't givin' me a thing girl.

I wanna tell her.

Your my American pie and I really, really wanna piece,
Cause you, keep my adrenaline high, and I'm never getting over this,
And now I'm singin'

Your in somebody else's bed,
You say you want me there instead,
You keep on messin' with my head,
When we get close to the end zone,
You put me back in the friend zone,
Hey, yeah, you put me back in the friend zone,
Hey, yeah, you put me back in the friend zone.

Your in somebody else's bed,
I'll climb through the window and break his head,
But Your all I ever wanted.

What kind of boyfriend's name is Ched,
Seriously!

F**k that dude or whatever his f***king name is!

Your in somebody else's bed,
You say you want me there instead,
You keep on messin' with my head,
When we get close to the end zone.

You put me back in the friend zone!

Your in somebody else's bed,
You say you want me there instead,
You keep on messin' with my head,
When we get close to the end zone.
Hey, yeah, you put me back in the friend zone
Hey, yeah, you put me back in the friend zone
Hey, yeah, you put me back in the friend zone
Hey, yeah

You put me back in the friend zone
