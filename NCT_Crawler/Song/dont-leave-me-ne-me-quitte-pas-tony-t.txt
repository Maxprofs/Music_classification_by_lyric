                        Bài hát: Don't Leave Me (Ne Me Quitte Pas) - Tony T.

Please don't leave me now
We have to forget
Yes, we must forget all that's flown away
Just forget the time and the things we said
In the time we had
Won't you show me how to forget those days
Which might break my heart?
Forget the reasons that killed our passion
Don't you leave me now
Don't you leave me now
Don't you leave me now...

I will offer you pearls made from the rain
Coming from the land Where sun never sets
I will plough the soil till days after death
Let your body be wrapped in gold and light
I'll create a world
Where Love is the king
Where Love is the law
And you'll be my queen
Don't you leave me now
Don't you leave me now
Don't you leave me now...

Please don't leave me now
I will speak to you the most crazy words
But you'll understand
And I'll tell you then stories of those two
Fell in love again with embracing hearts
Here's my fairy-tale of the king who's dead
'Cause he will no more see the queen that ́s you
Don't you leave me now
Don't you leave me now
Don't you leave me now...

One has often seen
Flames that were reborn from most oldest ash
Which was long time dead
And it ever seemed that most barren land
Yielded much more wheat than the best spring time
And in fading light in the burning sky
Lights of black and red join in love again
Don't you leave me now
Don't you leave me now
Don't you leave me now...

Please don't leave me now
I would cry no more
I would talk no more
Hide myself away
Only watching you when you dance and smile
Only hearing you when you laugh and sing
Let me be the shadow... of your shadow
Shadow of your hand, of the dof you hold
Don't you leave me now
Don't you leave me now
Please don't leave me now...
