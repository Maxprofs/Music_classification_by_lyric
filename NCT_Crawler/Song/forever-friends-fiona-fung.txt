                        Bài hát: Forever Friends - Fiona Fung

I believe I can love 
You give me your loving care 
I believe in what we are 
I don’t know where I would be 
Without you staying with me 
Sometimes, I’m lost in misery 
You will take me all the way, 
I’m not afraid 
Oh, you and me, hand in hand 
To everywhere amazing 
Be my friend, oh friend 
We are forever friends 
Oh baby, you give me all the love I need 
You are the only one 
I believe I can love 
You give me your loving care 
I believe in what we are 
You will take me all the way, as day by day 
Oh, you and me, hand in hand 
To everywhere amazing 
Be my friend, oh friend 
We are forever friends 
Oh baby, you give me all the love I need 
You are the only one
                        
                    |
