                        Bài hát: Dream Come True - Casey Lee Williams

[Verse 1]
I've been watchin' you lately
Chasing your tail and it drives me crazy
You'll never get that girl

She don't see in you the things that I can see
The girl's ice cold, it ain't meant to be
Looking above the upon you

I've been spending time wondering why
Nothing that I do can catch your eye
Just can't capture your attention

Maybe I'm too tall or not your type
But I'm not giving up, I'll get it right
Being close to you is my intention

I see more in you than the rest of them do
And I'm not gonna let you fall
I'll swallow my pride, time after time
Cause your worth it all

[Chorus]
Whenever I think of you
How I wish you only knew
That you might be my dream come true
But what do I have to do to make you notice me?

[Verse 2]
Oh, you know that
You and I we would be alright
We could dance on the roof, we could light the night
Gotta make you see me in that way

Why don't you
Forget about the little chick in white?
She don't care about you and she's so uptight. (Hey!)
Let me put a smile on your face

How I wish that you knew, that I'm crazy for you
And I'm waiting by your side. (To your side)
I'll get you alone, make you my own
It will be divine

I can keep on waiting
Cause my heart I've been saving
I think your gonna figure it out
I'm the one for you and there's no one else

[Chorus]
Whenever I think of you
And how I wish you only knew
That you might be my dream come true
But what do I have to do to make you my baby?

Whenever I think of you
(Oh whenever I think of you)
Only knew
(Oh how I wish you knew that I'm in love with you)
Dream come true
What do I have to do to make you notice?

It's gonna be you for me and me for you
Forget the chick in white and make my dream come true
Gotta get it right, when I get it done
I'm gonna win your heart, I'm gonna make you mine
Come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on, come on now baby

But what do I have to do to make you notice
Me?
Notice me
Notice me
                        
                    |
