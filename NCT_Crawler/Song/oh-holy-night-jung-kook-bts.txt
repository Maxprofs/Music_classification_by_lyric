                        Bài hát: Oh Holy Night - Jung Kook (BTS)

Oh holy night
The stars are brightly shining
It is the night
Of our dear Savior’s birth

Oh holy night
The stars are brightly shining
It is the night
Of our dear Savior’s birth

Long lay the world
In sin and error pining
Til He appeared
And the soul felt its worth

A thrill of hope
The weary world rejoices
For yonder breaks
A new and glorious morn

Oh Fall on your knees
Oh hear the angels voices
Oh night divine, Oh night when Christ was born
Oh night divine
Holy Night

A thrill of hope
The weary world rejoices
For yonder breaks
A new and glorious morn

Oh fall on your knees
Oh hear the angels voices
Oh night divine, Oh night when Christ was born
Oh night divine
Oh Holy Night
                        
                    |
