                        I make mistakes like any man
 But I try to love you best I can
 I can't convince you though heaven knows I try
 I've tried to make you see to make you believe You're all that matters to me
 The ground that you walk, the air that you breathe
 Someday you'll discover, I don't want no other
 Believe me, you're all that matters, baby
 All that matters to me I know that you've been hurt before
 But that won't happen anymore, no no
 Just give your heart to me, I'll guard it with my life
 I don't know what I'd do baby, without you You're all that matters to me
 The ground that you walk, the air that you breathe
 Someday you'll discover, I don't want no other
 Believe me, you're all that matters, baby
 All that matters to me People looking for paradise
 Well baby, I know that I found mine
 And if you don't believe it baby
 Take a look at the love in my eyes
 Oh I'll be with you, baby 'til the end of time
 I'll be alright baby just as long as you're mine You're all that matters to me
 The ground that you walk, the air that you breathe
 Someday you'll discover, I don't want no other
 Believe me, you're all that matters, baby
 All that matters to me You're all that matters to me
 The ground that you walk, the air that you breathe
 Someday you'll discover, I don't want no other
 Believe me, you're all that matters, baby
 All that matters to me You're all that matters to me
 The ground that you walk, the air that you breathe
 Someday you'll discover, I don't want no other
 Believe me, you're all that matters, baby
 All that matters to me
 Matters to me
