(Your call has been forwarded to an automated voice message)

Maybe I'm cold
Frozen from my past before, damn
Don't get too close
You won't find what you're looking for
Oh, no

And I hope you don't judge me
All I know is how to be who I am
And if you start to touch me
I hope you know the place where we stand

Don't tell me that you love me
'Cause I won't love back
Don't tell me that you need me
'Cause I don't need that
Don't tell me that you want me
'Cause I'm on my own
So when we finish touching
Girl, I'm all alone
All alone, all alone

Maybe I'm fine
Fine with being by myself, yeah
Maybe I'm not trying
Trying to have nobody else
I'm not

And I hope you don't judge me
All I know is how to be who I am
And if you start to touch me
I hope you know the place where we stand

Don't tell me that you love me
'Cause I won't love back
Don't tell me that you need me
'Cause I don't need that
Don't tell me that you want me
'Cause I'm on my own
So when we finish touching
Girl, I'm all alone
All alone, all alone, yeah

All alone
All alone
Alone
                        
                    |
