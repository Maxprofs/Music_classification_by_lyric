                        Bài hát: Drink To That All Night - Jerrod Niemann

Dontcha look now oh the parkin lots full
Gonna ride that cow with a Dallas bull 
Everybody in the ATL is comin
DJs got those speakers thumpin
Got a black ford not a white mercedes
Walkin in the front door checkin out the ladies
My buddy says hey boys I'm buyin
The hottest girl in here's givin me the eye and.

Everybody knows, its gonna be one of those
I can drink to that all night
Thats the stuff I like
Thats the kind of party makes you throw your hands up high
Bout to tie one on talkin gone gone gone
Turnin all the wrongs into right
I can drink to that all night

Workin on the sweet thing sittin on a bar stool
Doin shots of Jack girl gonna take it old school
Singin hell yeah to every song their playin
Do ya wanna dance? Baby I'm just sayin

Everybody knows, its gonna be one of those
I can drink to that all night
Thats the stuff I like
Thats the kind of party makes you throw your hands up high
Bout to tie one on talkin gone gone gone
Turnin all the wrongs into right
I can drink to that all night

Yeah, I can drink to that all night

Take your cup fill it up
You cant raise it high enough
Take your cup fill it up
You cant raise it high enough

Everybody knows, its gonna be one of those
I can drink to that all night
Thats the stuff I like
Thats the kind of party makes you throw your hands up 
I can drink to that all night
Thats the stuff I like
Thats the kind of party makes you throw your hands up high
Bout to tie one on talkin gone gone gone
Turnin all the wrongs into right
I can drink to that all night

I can drink to that all night
I can drink to that all night

Take your cup fill it up
You can't raise it high enough
Take your cup fill it up
You can't raise it high enough
Take your cup fill it up
You can't raise it high enough
Take your cup fill it up
You can't raise it high enough
