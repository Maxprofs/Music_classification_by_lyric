                        Bài hát: Loud - Jessie J, Lindsey Stirling

Why don't they hate you?
Why do they hate me?
Why are their blocks set up to debate but only forsake me
How am I doing?
And why do you care?
With my failures come the smiles,
When I win, I write, you just compare
So why, must've tried it on your love
When I'm better than what I've been
But that's not good enough
Why, you can't hear my decency
Instead of me singing to friends
I'm talking over enemies
The world is so

Loud
Loud, loud
It's so loud,
Loud, loud
It's like everything's drop in the crowd
They won't stop until they God damn tear you down
Man the world is so loud
Loud, loud,
It's so loud
Loud, loud
I tried to drown them all out in my sound
But they won't stop talking till they tear you down,
And so they tear me down

Until they tear me down

We show my destruction
That's why I'm so reluctant
Want me to pass the ball
But you're not on my team
You wanna cast a stone
We're so ready to fight
Got the nerve to ask, did I sleep? I heard you all through the night
Somebody tell me why, I know it's not just me
Over a billion voices
Don't think, just speak
You hate me when I'm up
You love me when I'm down
I'm so confused by the world,
Hey the world is so...

Loud
Loud, loud,
It's so loud
Loud, loud
It's like everything's drop in the crowd
They won't stop until they God damn tear you down
And the world is so loud
Loud, loud,
It's so loud
Loud, loud
I tried to drown them all out in my sound
But they won't stop talking till they tear you down
Until they tear me down

Until they tear me down

On a goal, I swear
I couldn't hear a sound
I couldn't hear a sound
As a little girl
With a little fortune
Hoping this is true
So tear me down

The world is so loud

So Loud
Loud, loud
It's so loud,
Loud, loud
It's like everything's drop in the crowd
They won't stop until they God damn tear you down
And the world is so loud
Loud, loud,
It's so loud
Loud, loud
I tried to drown them all out in my sound
But they won't stop talking till they tear you down
Until they tear me down

Until they tear you down

Take me as I am, as I am

The world is so loud
                        
                    |
