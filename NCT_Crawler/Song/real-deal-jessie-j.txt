Hey, woo!

Flying (fly up)
You and your heart woke up
So you choked on your silence (spoke up)
It's been a hot minute
Damn you hold me just how I like it (stroke up)
Touching you again on the other side of the
I never thought that I would see you again
Never thought that I would see you again (well hold up)

You can't deny the energy
That we got going on
I know you feel the chemistry
This *** feels so strong
Cloud nine, I'm feeling heavenly
This vibe we fell upon
You touching every part of me
This *** feels so strong

This could be the real deal (oh yeah)
This could be the real deal (oh yeah)
I don't wanna waste it, take the risk and make it (oh yeah)
Ain't no need for faking, love is for the taking (we special)
This could be the real deal (oh yeah)
This could be the real deal (oh yeah)

Uh, hey
Falling (in love)
Oh you got me laughing till the early hours of the morning (sun up)
Connections shouldn't turn up on your doorstep and you just ignore it (turn up, hey)
It's important that we keep it rocking, never stop it
I don't want nobody else ever again
Nobody else ever again (you got it)

You can't deny the energy
That we got going on
I know you feel the chemistry
This *** feels so strong
Cloud nine, I'm feeling heavenly
This vibe we fell upon
You touching every part of me
This *** feels so strong

This could be the real deal (oh yeah)
This could be the real deal (oh yeah)
I don't wanna waste it, take the risk and make it (oh yeah)
Ain't no need for faking, love is for the taking (we special)
This could be the real deal (oh yeah)
This could be the real deal (oh yeah)

You and me (you and me)
Till the end (till the end)
We know it's right (we know it's right)
Let's not pretend (let's not pretend)
I'm dreaming (dreaming, dreaming)
Believing (believing-lieving)
The conversation (conversation)
Get naked (naked)
Oh baby (oh baby)
I'm shaking (I'm shaking)
Dreaming in love
Believing in love
In love, yeah
(Believing in love, believing in love)
In love, yeah
(Believing in love, believing in love)

This could be the real deal (haha, oh yeah)
This could be the real deal (this could be the real deal, oh yeah)
I don't wanna waste it (I don't wanna waste it)
Take the risk and make it (take the risk and make it, oh yeah)
Ain't no need for faking (ain't no need for faking)
Love is for the taking (love is for the taking) (we special)
This could be the real deal (yeah, oh yeah)
This could be the real deal (this could be the real deal, oh yeah)

Haha
