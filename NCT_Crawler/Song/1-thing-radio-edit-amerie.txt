                        [Intro:]
 Na, na, na, na, oh
 Na, na, na, na, oh
 Na, na, na, na, oh
 Na, na, na, na, oh

 [Verse One:]
 Oh, been trying to let it go
 Trying to keep my eyes closed
 Trying to keep it just like before
 The times we never even thought to speak
 Don't wanna tell you what it is
 Oh wee it felt so serious
 Got me thinking just too much
 I wanna set it off, but

 [Chorus:]
 It's this 1 thing that's got me trippin
 It's this 1 thing that's got me trippin (you did)
 This 1 thing my soul may be feeling
 It's this 1 thing you did oh oh oh
 It's this 1 thing that caught me slippin
 It's this 1 thing I want to admit it
 This 1 thing and I was so with it
 It's this 1 thing you did oh oh oh

 [Verse Two:]
 Hey, we don't know each other well
 So what? I keep thinking to myself
 Memories just keep ringing bells
 Oh oh, Oh oh, Oh
 Hear voices I don't want to understand
 My car keys are jingling in my hand
 My high heels a clicking towards your door
 Oh oh, Oh oh, Oh

 [Chorus:]
 It's this 1 thing that's got me trippin'
 It's this 1 thing that's got me trippin' (you did)
 This 1 thing my soul may be feeling
 It's this 1 thing you did oh oh oh
 It's this 1 thing that's caught me slippin'
 It's this 1 thing I want to admit it
 This 1 thing and I was so with it
 It's this 1 thing you did oh oh oh

 [Bridge:]
 Maybe I just can't believe it
 It's this one thing you did oh oh oh
 I can deny and try, try and do it long enough just to keep from seein' it
 I'm hoping you can keep a secret
 For me
 But what you did, yeah

 [Chorus:]
 It's this 1 thing that's got me trippin'
 It's this 1 thing that's got me trippin' (you did)
 This 1 thing my soul may be feeling
 It's this 1 thing you did oh oh oh
 It's this 1 thing that's caught me slippin'
 It's this 1 thing I want to admit it
 This 1 thing and I was so with it
 It's this 1 thing you did oh oh oh

 Oh oh oh [4 times]

 Na, na, na, na, oh
 Na, na, na, na, oh
 Na, na, na, na, oh
 Na, na, na, na, oh

 [Chorus:]
 It's this 1 thing that's got me trippin
 It's this 1 thing that's got me trippin (you did)
 This 1 thing my soul may be feeling
 It's this 1 thing you did oh oh
 It's this 1 thing that's caught me slippin
 It's this 1 thing I want to admit it
 This 1 thing and I was so with it
 It's this 1 thing you did oh oh

 [Chorus:]
 It's this 1 thing that's got me trippin
 It's this 1 thing that's got me trippin (you did)
 This 1 thing my soul may be feeling
 It's this 1 thing you did oh oh oh
 It's this 1 thing that's caught me slippin
 It's this 1 thing I want to admit it
 This 1 thing and I was so with it
 It's this 1 thing you did oh oh oh

 Oh oh, Oh oh
