                        Bài hát: Summer In December - Morandi, Inna

Midnight 
I'm not feeling so strong now 
I'm not ready to give up on you 

My song hurts
Maybe I'm playin' it wrong now
Cold eyes and everything's fadin'
And though I'm blinded
Now my eyes can see
Your love
Baby doesn't love to love me
Love me

Tonight
Oh baby say my name
Tonight
I want you to remember
Our love burning like a flame forever
Summer in December

My sky used to be golden
But you paint it
Into shades of grey
Slow down
Baby I'm already broken
Blue eyes and everythings fadin
This time I'll never
Be the same again
It feels like my
Hearts is no longer
Beatin' beatin'

Tonight
Oh baby say my name
Tonight
I want you to remember
Our love burning like a flame forever
Summer in December

Summer in December
Summer in December
Summer in December
Summer in December
