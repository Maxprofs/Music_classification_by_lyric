                        Bài hát: I Don't Wanna Live Forever Cover - Conor Maynard

[Conor Maynard:]
Here we are, all alone in this room
And girl I know where to start and what we gon' do

[William Singe:]
Wanna put my fingers in your hair
Wrap me up in your legs
And love you till your eyes roll back
I'm gon' put you to bed, bed, bed
I'm gon' put you to bed, bed, bed

[Conor Maynard:]
So *** that new girl that you love so bad
I know you still think about the times we had

[William Singe:]
It's seven o'clock on the dot
I'm in my drop top, cruising the streets

[Conor Maynard:]
I can hear your heart, crying out for me babe

[William Singe:]
Been feeling you all the while girl and I must confess
Let's get married

[Conor Maynard:]
You used to call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone

[William Singe:]
I turn the Ritz into a poor house
It's like eviction number four now

[Conor Maynard:]
Cuz your love got me looking so crazy right now
Your touch got me looking so crazy right now

[William Singe:]
Cuz' girl you're worth it
You're always worth it
And you deserve it
The way you work it

[Conor Maynard:]
Girl you know I-I-I
Girl you know I-I-I
I've been thinkin' bout forever

[William Singe:]
And girl you know I-I-I
Girl you know I-I-I
You're all that matters to me

[Together:]
Birthday sex, birthday sex

[William Singe:]
Man I love this ***
I love it, I love it

[Conor Maynard:]
And everyone falls in love sometimes
So where are you now that I need ya?

[Together:]
I don't wanna live forever, 'cause I know I'll be living in vain
Will you come back home
                        
                    |
