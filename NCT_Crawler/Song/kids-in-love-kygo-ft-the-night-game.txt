                        Song: Kids In Love - Kygo, The Night Game, Maja Francis

This is our last goodbye
Don't come and find me
So hard to the crowd
Please, somebody blind me

Cause I can feel it
I'm still lagging onto every word
My heart is beating
And I'm sorry that I left you hurt

We were kids in love
And then we grew up
But won't you hold me close tonight
Like we're kids in love
Kids in love
Kids in love
Kids in love

We were kids in love
We were kids in love

Engine on [?] in drive
Running for hours
Slowly, we twist the knife in
Folding like towers

And I can feel it
And we're running out of hope tonight
I hear you breathing
As we're hanging on to you and I

We were kids in love
And then we grew up
But won't you hold me close tonight
Like we're kids in love
Kids in love
Kids in love
Kids in love

Maybe I could cope if I could hold you
We were kids in love

One last time, one last time
And wherever you go, I'll just hold you forever
Maybe I could cope if I could hold you
We were kids in love
Kids in love
Kids in love
Kids in love
                        
                    |
