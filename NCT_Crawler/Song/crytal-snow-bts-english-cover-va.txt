                        Bài hát: Crytal Snow (BTS English Cover) - V.A

It's building up inside of me
Like the snow outside my window
Each snowflake that you send to me
Says to keep looking up

So much time has passed
Before we could meet at last
So we think "how do we do?"
"Could we come through?"
This unclear, strange feeling
We call love

This big world that we live in
Runs faster than we think
What a shame

How we gonna change it?
We don't know yet
But let's still try

Hurry
This love between you and me
Slowly
It's starting to break free

Before you go
I want to hold you tight in my arms
So that maybe you'll stay
Once will do
It never stays the same
Growing endlessly, crystal

There's nothing that
I will ever need
If you could stay with me
So let me ask you
Can I touch your heart?

Although it drifts away
I know I'll reach it
Oh someday, someday

When you go and smile like that
It hurts a little somehow
(How can I be closer?)
A question that I always ask
But answers never come by
(How I'm going to find it?
What should I do?
Oh let me know?)

My my my
Turning blurry, this crystal snow
Oh this unhappy story
I'm sick of it already
Gonna change the course
Of our destiny
Surely, I'm certain
Please just trust me

Before you leave 
I want to shelter you from all harm 
So that maybe you'll stay 
Once will do 
Now matter how I pray 
Flying far away crystal 

Even centuries decide to pass me by 
Let's keep walking side-by-side 
So let me ask you 
"Can I be your one?" 
I'll get to call your name 
When we're covered in white 
Oh Someday, someday 

The space between us is too far 
How did we end up being so far? 
The colors that we only know 
It'll paint us from head to toe 

The dark sky above your worried face 
The icy air that fills the space
(I feel, I feel, I feel, I feel) 

Oh crystal snow
Crystal snow 
On the page where you pass me by 
You behind to melt away slowly 
Falling and falling and falling deep
Into my heart just like rain 
(It sings to me) 
Shining like diamonds in the sky 
It's hard to look away from you 
So don't you say goodbye 
I'll wait for you 
Wherever I may go 
Even dreams miss you so
Take my hand and let me know 

The heat of our two hearts 
Flow right into this new melody 
Let's sing this song 
Til our throats give out 
Forever hand in hand 

Before you go 
I want to hold you tight in my arms 
So that maybe you'll stay 
Once will do 
It never stays the same 
Growing endlessly crystal 

My words are not enough 
To show it all
But I'll still give it my all
So let me ask you 
"Can I touch you heart?" 
I'd run a thousand miles 
Just to see you smile 
Someday, someday 

Its always you, it's always you
Crystal snow 
(Let me see your smile, oh baby) 
It's always you, it's always you 
Crystal snow
(Let me feel your love
Forever in my heart) 
It's always you, it's always you 
Crystal snow

Let me feel your love 
Our crystal snow 
Oh yeah 
Crystal snow 
Wherever we may go baby 
Crystal snow
                        
                    |
