                        Song: Lalala - Saul Williams

Nigga, you betta drink half a gallon of Shaolin
Before you pluck the strings of my violin
My life is orchestrated, like London symphony
Concentrated, niggas waited and waited
I'm birthday whistles, belated

Blow out the candles, I wait in the darkness like a vandal
The silhouette of set in the mirror on the mantle
Fire place is in the heart, water places the art
'Round the island of desiring where most primitives stalk

Sacrificing their daughters, these primordial waters
Carry a feminine agenda that no man ever taught us
True they captured and caught us, transported, sold us and bought us
Constituted and lawed us, distorted truths that they taught us

We rebelled, then fought us, we conformed, then they formed us
Now y'all niggas rhyming 'bout material possessions
My Adidas are three years old like my daughter, niggas
Rhyme 'bout Alize and need to rhyme about water

But out of chaos comes order
Out of chaos comes order, out of chaos comes order
Out of chaos comes order, out of chaos comes order
Out of chaos comes order, out of chaos comes order
Fake niggas run for the border

La la la la, la la la la
La la la la, la la la la

In a past life I was a woodcarver's knife
The sharpened blade of a woodcutter
The eldest son of the chief's brother
A maker of drums

We scraped the insides of goat hides
And seek the hollows where sound resides
Offering the parts we did not use
To invoke the muse

Music of the ghettos, the cosmos
The Negroes, the necros
Overcomers of death, disciples of breath
Dissection of drumbeats like Osirus by Seth

Break beats into fourteen pieces
Dissembled chaos, organized noise
A patchwork of heartbeats to resurrect
True b-boys, be men

Let's mend the broken heart of Isis
Age of Aquarius, mother nature is furious
While you rhyme about being hardcore, be heartcore
What is it that we do art for?

Metaphor, metasin, it's an age of healing
Why not rhyme about what you're feeling or not be felt
Deal with the cards you're dealt
Calling on tarot readers and sparrow feeders
To cancel the Apocalypse
Metaphorically speaking, metaphorically speaking
                        
                    |
