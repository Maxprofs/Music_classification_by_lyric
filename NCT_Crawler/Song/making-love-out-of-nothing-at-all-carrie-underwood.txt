                        Bài hát: Making Love Out Of Nothing At All - Carrie Underwood

I know just how to whisper 
And I know just how to cry 
I know just where I find the answers 
And I know just how to lie 
I know just how to fake it 
And I know just how to scheme 
I know just when to face the truth 
And then I know just when to dream 
And I know just where I touch you 
And I know just what to prove 
I know when to pull you closer 
And I know when to let you loose 

And I know the night is fading 
And I know the time’s gonna fly 
And I’m never gonna tell you everything I gotta tell you 
But I know I’ve got to give it a try 

And I know the roads to riches 
And I know the ways to pain 
I know all the rules and then I know how to break’em 
And then I always know the name of the game 

But I don’t know how to leave you 
And I’ll never let you fall 
And I don’t know how you do it 
Making love out of nothing at all 

Making love 
Out of nothing at all 
Making love 
Out of nothing at all 
Making love 
Out of nothing at all 
Making love 
Out of nothing at all 
Making love 
Out of nothing at all 
Making love 
Out of nothing at all 

Everytime I see you, on the rays of the sun are all 
Streaming through the waves in your hair 
And every star in the sky is taking aim at your eyes 
Like a spotlight 
The beating of my heart is a drum and it’s lost 
And it’s looking for a rhythm like you 
You can take the darkness from the deep of the night 
And turn it to a beacon burning endlessly bright 
I gotta follow it ‘cause everything I know 
Well, it’s nothing ‘till I give it to you 

I can make the runner stumble 
I can make the final block 
And I can make every tackle at the sound of the whistle 
And I can make all the stadiums rock 

I can make tonight forever 
Or I can make it disa
                        
                    |
