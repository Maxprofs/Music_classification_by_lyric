                        Bài hát: Our Love - Kelly Willard, Roby Duke

Our love filled with God's love is unending
Our love is a song that's just begun
He made you especially to share this life with me
There's just no end to our love

Our love like a flower is unfolding
Our love like a fragrance fills the air
And what we feel today will become
                        
                    |
