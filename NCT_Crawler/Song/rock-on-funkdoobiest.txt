                        As sure as the sun rises in the East
 It also sets in the West Our sons done it, the gods never fronted
 *** nuns *** a devil when the weight got hunted
 My soul was sweeping, my mind keep stepping
 In the depths of hell, yet I fell from the lesson My soul leaves the body the situations nody
 Original invisible to the ones who are tardy
 A class for the better 'cause I be writing letters
 Setting *** straight, one laugh at one shepherd Her face turns purple and demons in the surb
 I held my breathe and I left out the wound kinda fertile
 From the East the light shines onto the West
 A test for the gods 'cause that's just where they rest A tune for serenity, ***ing up the enemy
 If anyone makes it, then that's the way it's meant to be
 Tried her, the times of a fighter
 'Cause I'll supply Phife then step out the side door If your soul loves the sun, money, rock on
 If your soul loves the sun, money, rock on
 If your soul loves the sun, money, rock on
 If your soul loves the sun, money, rock on
 Rock on, rock on The gods keep praying, saviors ain't saving
 Nobody's soul yet the devil keeps playing
 And kicked out the heavens, I rest on the seven
 West of 85, if your chest type are warring Now, is the mystery one peace for victory
 'Cause I know gods that will put you out your misery
 Justice will lead 'em, deprived you of freedom
 The beat broke the seal even though you don't need em The beats and the Harlet, the land is a target
 The truth will prevail but not many say far fetched
 From 24 elders and half its 12, ruler
 Bitches mess with knowledge of sale If your soul loves the sun, money, rock on
 If your soul loves the sun, money, rock on
 If your soul loves the sun, money, rock on
 If your soul loves the sun, money, rock on
 Rock on, rock on Lets see, it started with the serpent
 Messing with Eve 'cause she wasn't certain
 Nobody's got a temper, a spiritual dilemma
 Enter in the realm where the spirits in the center *** perpetrating 'cause they'll murder Satan
 See faith broke the seal while the world be waiting
 He left it all to Jesus, I'm picking up the pieces
 Friends that's deceased can never read my thesis Don't be resurrected and times got so hectic
 Demons ain't elected while the money gets collected
 The gods get theirs and the word is born
 I mean the signs of the future is what they saw And the four living castles, life's got no hassles
 It's all real real, just one big feascal
 No soul held me hostage, angels kill the nonsense
 Bond is my word but first do the knowledge If your soul loves the sun, money, rock on
 If your soul loves the sun, money, rock on
 If your soul loves the sun, money, rock on
 If your soul loves the sun, money, rock on If your soul loves the sun, money, rock on
 If your soul loves the sun, money, rock on
 If your soul loves the sun, money, rock on
 If your soul loves the sun, money, rock on
 Rock on If your soul loves the sun, money, rock on
 Rock on
 If your soul loves the sun, money, rock on
 Rock on If your soul loves the sun, money, rock on
 Rock on
 If your soul loves the sun, money, rock on
 Rock on
