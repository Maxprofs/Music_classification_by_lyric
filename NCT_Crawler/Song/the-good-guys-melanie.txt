                        (Melanie Safka) I'm tired of seeing the picture
 You're painting of yourself
 You with the borrowed colors
 That you picked from someone else
 Maybe you're a movie
 Or some best selling book
 I know your mirrored mornings
 In rehearsal of your looks
 Oh your cause is oh so beautiful
 You're ready to begin
 You're going to play the good guys
 By singing the good guys hymn
 Ah you're building the halls with the outer walls
 But you haven't got a thing within The innocence of children
 Is the manner you suppose
 And you can describe in full detail
 What we already know
 Ah your cause is all so pretty
 And we're ready to begin
 We're going to play the good guys
 By singing the good guys hymn
 Ah we're building the halls with the outer walls
 But we haven't got a thing within But if we keep on trying
 Though our purpose isn't clear
 We just may move the universe
 We'll learn to really care
 Eventually the whole facade
 Becomes more than a whim
 By starting to build on the outside
 We're gonna fill up the walls within
 By starting to build on the outside
 We'll fill up the wallls within
 Eventually the whole facade
 Becomes more than a whim
 And by starting to build on the outside
 We're gonna fill up the walls
 We're gonna fill up the walls within
                        
                    |
