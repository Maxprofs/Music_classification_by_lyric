                        Bài hát: To Love Somebody - Lizz Wright

[Intro:]
Oh oh oh oh oh oh ooo

[Verse 1:]
There’s a light
A certain kind of light
That’s never shown on me
I want my whole life to be
Lived with you.. lived with you
There’s a way
Everybody say
To do every every little thing
What good does it bring
If I ain’t got you.. if I ain’t got you

[Chorus:]
You don’t know what it’s like
Honey you don’t know what it’s like
To love somebody... to love somebody
The way that I love you

[Verse 2:]
In my brain
I see your face again
And I know my frame.. my frame of mind
You don’t have to be so blind
Oh but I’m blind.. yes I’m so blind
I’m a woman
Can you see what I am
I live and I breathe I live and breathe for you
What good... what good does it do
If I ain’t got you... if I ain’t got you

[Chorus:]
You don’t know what it’s like
Honey you don’t know what it’s like
To love somebody..to love somebody
The way that I love you
Hey... to love somebody... to love somebody
The way I love you.. the way I love you.. the way I love you
Hey.. you don’t know what it’s like.. oh you don’t know what it’s like
To love somebody the way I love you
                        
                    |
