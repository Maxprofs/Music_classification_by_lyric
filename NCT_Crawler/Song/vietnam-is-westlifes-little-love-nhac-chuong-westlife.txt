                        Bài hát: Vietnam Is Westlife's Little Love ( Nhạc Chuông) - Westlife

People ask me why
I always smile and have a strong belief.
I just tell them
it’s all because of WESTLIFE
My heart is SHANE
My mind is MARK
Oh my soul is NICKY
And KIAN is the one I’ve always dreamt of, oh yeah

And don’t you see my restless heart is waiting,
waiting for a day you come to me

So I say a little prayer and hope my dream will take you here
My country VIETNAM
Where all its love’s for you, WESTLIFE
Come to me and you will see
How beautiful you mean to me
Dreams are incomplete without you here with me, WESTLIFE.

Your smiling eyes
Your charming voice
You’re everything I need

You are the sun, the stars that light up my life, WESTLIFE
How can I live just one day long without your great music?
You’re all my breathes, all that I believe in, WESTLIFE.

And don’t you see my restless heart is waiting, waiting for a day you come to me

Finally my little prayer is heard by God and dream comes true
I can’t believe one day
I will reach you right here, in VIETNAM
Come to you and let you see
How beautiful you mean to me
It’s a perfect dream when you are here with me

To hold you in my arms
To hear your voice so close
To see your shining smiles
WESTLIFE, you’re all I need

WESTLIFE can’t you feel my restless heart???

Finally my little prayer is heard by God and dream comes true
I can’t believe one day
I will reach you right here, in VIETNAM
Come to you and let you see
How beautiful you mean to me
It’s a perfect dream when you are here with me


Your name is in each prayer (my sweet love)
And my dream becomes true
I can’t believe one day I will reach you right here.

Say to you all sweetest words
That only you I love the most
God has spent to me a miracle, it’s you, WESTLIFE.
