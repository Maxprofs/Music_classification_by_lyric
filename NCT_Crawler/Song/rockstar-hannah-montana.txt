                        Yeah, uh oh, uh oh, uh oh, yeah, hey, hey, yeah 

whoo! 

Sometimes I walk a little faster, 
In the school hallway just to get next to you 

Some days I spend a little extra time, 
In the morning just to impress you 

Guess you don't notice, 
Guess you dont need this, 
Sad you're not seein' what you're missin' 
On the outside shyin' away, 
On the inside dyin' to say 

I'm unusual, 
Not so typical, 
Way too smart to be waiting around, 
Tai Chi practicin' 
Snowboard champion, 
I could fix the flat on your car, 
I might even be a rockstar 
I might even be a rockstar! 

Sometimes I wish, 
When the phone rings, 
That it would be you, 
Sayin' let's hang out! 
Then you confess, 
That there's somethin' 
Special between us, 
Why don't we find out? 

But you don't even know me, 
Guess you don't need me, 
Why you're not seein' what you're missin' 
On the outside shyin' away, 
On the inside dyin' to say, 
Whoo! 

I'm unusual, 
Not so typical, 
Way to smart to be waiting around, 
Tai Chi practicin' 
Snowboard champion, 
I could fix the flat on your car, 
I might even be a rockstar (A rockstar) 

If you only knew who the real me, 
I might even be a rockstar, 
I'm tellin' you that we are meant to be, 
Now wouldn't it be nice if you could see, 
That I really am a rockstar! 
(yeah, yeah) 

Whoo! 

Yeah, I really am a rockstar, 
Hey, hey, hey! 

Whoo! Ha, a rockstar! 

I'm unusual, 
Not so typical, 
Way to smart to be waiting around, (Yeah!) 
Tai Chi practicin' 
Snowboard champion! 
I could fix the flat on your car, 
Rockin' it where ever we are! 
Yeah, yeah, yeah! 
'Cause I really am a rockstar 
'Cause I really am a rockstar 

I am a rockstar 

Wah oh ah oh 

Yeah, Goodnight everybody!
