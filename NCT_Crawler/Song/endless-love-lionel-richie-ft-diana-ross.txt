                        Bài hát: Endless Love - Lionel Richie, Diana Ross

My love
There's only you in my life
The only thing that's right

My first love
You're every breath that I take
You're every step I make

And I
I want to share
All my love with you
No one else will do

And your eyes
They tell me how much you care
Oh, yes you will always be
My endless love

Two hearts
Two hearts that beat as one
Our lives had just begun

Forever
I'll hold you close in my arms
I can't resist your charms

And love
I'll be a fool for you
I'm sure
You know I don't mind
Whoooooa, you know I don't mind

'Cos you
You mean the world to me
Oh, I know
I know I found in you
My endless love

[Instrumental Interlude]

Oooooooh
And love
I'll be that fool for you
I'm sure
You know I don't mind
Whooooa, you know I don't mind
And yes
You'll be the only one
'Cos no one can't deny
This love I have inside
And I'll give it all to you
My love
My endless love
