                        Bài hát: Legends Never Die - Ferras, Katy Perry

[Ferras:]
Rev up leaving all in the dust
Got a Cadillac six-pack vision of us
Tonight, we ride high into the desert sky
Hands up feel the heat in the air
Legends never die they play truth or dare
Tonight it’s our time, let go of the wheel and drive
How does it feel to fly

We are the stars that shine
We don’t even have to try
We could go down in flames
But we’ll melt our world away
All I know it’s you're my rock n roll
And wherever we go we are heroes, heroes
They don’t make ‘em like you and I
Legends never die

[Katy Perry:]
Undressed in a beautiful mess
But I got your gold heart right here in my chest
They say we’re crazy
So baby lets go insane

Cause I know a key when we’re together
I know we will live forever maybe
One day we’ll make history
How does it feel to be free

We are the stars that shine
We don’t even have to try
We could go down in flames
But we’ll melt our world away
All I know it’s you're my rock n roll
And wherever we go we are heroes, heroes
They don’t make ‘em like you and I
Legends never die, die
Legends never die, die
Legends never

Burn out, just a fade away
We keep the clock turning like a figure 8
Tonight, it’s our time
Let go of the wheel and drive

We are the stars that shine
We don’t even have to try
We could go down in flames
But we’ll melt our world away
All I know it’s you're my rock n roll
And wherever we go we are heroes, heroes, heroes
They don’t make ‘em like you and I
Legends never die, die
Legends never die, die
Legends never die, die

[Ferras:]
All I know it’s you're my rock n roll
And wherever we go we are heroes, heroes
They don’t make ‘em like you and I
Legends never die, die
Legends never die, die
                        
                    |
