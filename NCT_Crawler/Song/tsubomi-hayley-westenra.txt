                        Bài hát: Tsubomi - Hayley Westenra

Only now I know of time
For too long I have
Drifted, never turning back
Now I am standing, the tide
Drawing me
I never felt so weak,
'Cos you mean everything to me.

Only you I feel your love
Golden, burning
Covering just like a glove
I feel the warmth of your gaze
Over me
Never felt such tranquility inside of me

And like a distant dream I see
The blossom vanishing
Just as each bud finally is blossoming
And I watch each petal dance
It's way over to me
They fall
They fall
They fall
All around me

I am here with you
You are here with me
Your smile and your loving face
Is everything I see
And, in this town
The memories you left behind
Swirld round and around
And forever I'm searching for the light
On a cloud away from time
Where our memories can shine
Wait for me and we can live them all
Again

Only now do I see you
In the way that other people do
I see you clearer than before
And love you more
I never knew that I would feel this way

And like a distant dream I see
The blossom vanishing
Just as each bud finally is blossoming
And I watch each petal dance
It's way over to me
They fall
They fall
They fall
All around me

I am here with you
You are here with me
Your smile and your loving face
Is everything I see
And, in this town
The memories you left behind
Swirld round and around
And forever I'm searching for the light
On a cloud away from time
Where our memories can shine
Wait for me and we can live them all
Again

I am here with you
You are here with me
Your smile and your loving face
Is everything I see
I am here with you
You are here with me
Your smile and your loving face
Is everything I see

I am here with you
You are here with me
Your smile and your loving face
Is everything I see
And, in this town
The memories you left behind
Swirld round and around
And forever I'm searching for the light
On a cloud away from time
Where our memories can shine
Wait for me and we can live them all
Again
