                        Bài hát: Within You'll Remain (Hòa Tấu Tranh Sáo Bầu) - V.A

Facing the world with an empty heart I could disappear into the dark
And you were the one who could always make my dreams Come true my dear it's you
when you're not around my heart stood still
Within you'll remain and always will ...
Lllusions say there is another man
Who would interfere into my plans

(我愛你) i love you (我愛你) i need you
More than i ever did to anyone
I Never felt like this before
(我愛你) I love you (我愛你) I need you
We could be two lovers from the past
And the future is our chance...

when you're not around my heart stood still
Within you'll remain and always will ...
我愛你) I love you (我愛你) I need you
More than i ever did to anyone
I Never felt like this before
(我愛你) I love you (我愛你) I need you
We could be two lovers from the past
And the future is our chance...
                        
                    |
