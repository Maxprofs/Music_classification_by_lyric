                        I'm halfway gone, sleepless I'm battle-worn
 And you're all I want, so bring me the dawn I need the sun to break, you've woken up my heart
 I'm shaking, oh my luck could change
 Been in the dark for weeks and I've realized you're all I need
 I hope that I'm not too late, and I hope I'm not too late Back of the room, how come my friends already know you?
 Feel like a kid, too shy to speak up so I keep it hid
 Oh butterflies, you steal my sleep each night I need the sun to break, you've woken up my heart
 I'm shaking, oh my luck could change
 Been in the dark for weeks and I've realized you're all I need
 I hope that I'm not too late, and I hope I'm not too late
 Ooh, oh, oh
 Ooh, oh, oh
 Ooh, oh, oh I need the sun to break, you've woken up my heart
 I'm shaking, oh my luck could change
 Been in the dark for weeks and I've realized you're all I need
 I hope that I'm not too late, and I hope I'm not too late Oh no yes I hope that I'm not too late
 Ooh, oh, oh
 Ooh, oh, oh
 Ooh, oh, oh
 Ooh, oh, oh
