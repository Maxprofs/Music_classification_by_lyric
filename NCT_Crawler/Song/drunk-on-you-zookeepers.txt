                        Bài hát: Drunk On You - Zookeepers

[Verse 1]
Don't stop what you're doing
You're good when you're good
When you're bad you're the best
No, I can't stop looking
You make my heart beat out of my chest

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Let me know what you're thinking
You're looking so good in your ripped up jeans
Let me know what you're drinking
Choose from the bar, next drink is on me

[Chorus]
Hey, I'm not in love
I'm just a little drunk on you
Hey, I'm not in love
I'm just a little drunk on you
Hey, I'm not in love
I'm just a little drunk on you
Hey, I'm not in love
I'm just a little, just a little drunk on you
Drunk on you
Hey, I'm not in love
I'm just a little drunk on you
Hey, I'm not in love
I'm just a little drunk on you

[Verse 2]
I can't even shut up
I keep spilling words over you all the time
I think of it too much
But I'm not done, not done to your mind

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Let me know what you're thinking
You're looking so good when you're looking at me, yeah
Let me know what you're drinking
Pouring them down like one, two, three

[Chorus]
Hey, I'm not in love
I'm just a little drunk on you
Hey, I'm not in love
I'm just a little, just a little drunk on you
Drunk on you
Hey, I'm not in love
I'm just a little drunk on you
Hey, I'm not in love
I'm just a little drunk on you

[Bridge]
Tomorrow I will be sober
And there will be no more
You and I, you and I
Just a little hungover
And aftertaste to remember you by

[Chorus]
Hey, I'm not in love
I'm just a little drunk on you
Hey, I'm not in love
I'm just a little, just a little drunk on you
Drunk on you
Hey, I'm not in love
I'm just a little drunk on you
Hey, I'm not in love
I'm just a little drunk on you
                        
                    |
