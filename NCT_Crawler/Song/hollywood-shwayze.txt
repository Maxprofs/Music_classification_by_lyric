                        Some say when it rains it pours
 Hollywood ain't no place for lovers anymore
 And it ain't no place for us Some say when it rains it pours
 Hollywood ain't no place for lovers anymore
 And it ain't no place for us Ay yo
 What the hell am I rhymin' for?
 Designer clothes and designer whores
 Designer cars and designer doors
 Designer kitchen with designer drawers Hell no, vagina dog
 The other *** wore me like a monologue
 Like the Beatles when they were bigger than Jesus
 I'm a genius, Bill Clinton with my speeches
 Look you in the eye and lie, believe it, I mean it Girl, I'm leavin'
 I don't really know where I'm gonna go
 But I got a backpack full of demos
 I'm a player baby, I should run for mayor maybe The way I'm politickin' lately
 The way I'm politickin' ladies
 The way I'm politickin' ladies Some say when it rains it pours
 Hollywood ain't no place for lovers anymore
 And it ain't no place for us Some say when it rains it pours
 Hollywood ain't no place for lovers anymore
 And it ain't no place for us I'm convinced that if I hop the fence
 I can climb on in and get my fingerprints on your booty, Julie
 I know you wanna do me
 Since I moved to Malibu from the hood like a movie Peoples chant with my sneakers in the sand
 Blowin' up like an amp so they kicked me out the band
 That's when I met my man strummin' on a six string
 Drink in his hand, talkin' to his ding-a-ling Why's everybody always pickin' on me?
 Why's everybody always pickin' on me?
 Why's everybody always pickin' on me?
 Why's everybody still comin' to my party? Some say when it rains it pours
 Hollywood ain't no place for lovers anymore
 And it ain't no place for us Some say when it rains it pours
 Hollywood ain't no place for lovers anymore
 And it ain't no place for us Everybody comin' to my party, it starts today
 We gettin' naughty by nine, so don't be late
 There's gonna be a line so be prepared to wait Fine, fine, ladies first
 And bring your ice skates and bring your wings
 We all gettin' high tonight and touchin' things and things
 Muffin butt blowin' cigarette rings Everybody comin' to my party
 Everybody comin' to my party
 Everybody comin' to my party
 Everybody comin' to my party Some say when it rains it pours
 Hollywood ain't no place for lovers anymore
 Some say when it rains it pours
 Hollywood ain't no place for lovers anymore Some say when it rains it pours
 Hollywood ain't no place for lovers anymore
 And it ain't no place for us Some say when it rains it pours
 Hollywood ain't no place for lovers anymore
 And it ain't no place for us Some say when it rains it pours
 Hollywood ain't no place for lovers anymore
 And it ain't no place for us Some say when it rains it pours
 Hollywood ain't no place for lovers anymore
 And it ain't no place for us
