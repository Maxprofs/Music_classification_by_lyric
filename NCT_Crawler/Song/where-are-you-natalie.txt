                        Bài hát : Where Are You - Natalie

I know you're out there baby
Somewhere

There's someone out there for me
(I know there's somebody out there)
I know she's waiting so patiently
Can you tell her name
(Won't somebody tell me her name)
This lifelong search is going to drive me insane
(That's right)

How does she laugh, how does she cry
What's the color of her eyes
Does she even realize, I'm here

Where is she, where is she, where is she
Where is this beautiful girl
Who is she, who is she
Who's going to complete my world
Where is she, where is she
Where is this beautiful girl
Who is she, who is she
Who's going to complete my world
(Where are you)

I'm staring out at the sky
(I see you baby)
Praying that he will walk in my life
Where is the man of my dreams, yeah yeah
(I'm right here)
I'll wait forever, how silly it seems

How does he laugh, how does he cry
What's the color of his eyes
Does he even realize, I'm here

Where is he, where is he, where is he
Where is this beautiful guy
Who is he, who is he
Who's going to take me so high
Where is he, where is he
Where is this beautiful guy
Who is he, who is he
Who's going to take me so high
(Where are you)

There's someone out there for me
(There's someone out there for me)
I know she's waiting so patiently
(So patiently)
Can you tell me her name
(Can you tell me his name)
This lifelong search is going to drive me insane
(Thats right)

How does he laugh, how does he cry
What's the color of his eyes
Does he even realize, I'm here

Where is she, where is she, where is she
Where is this beautiful girl
Who is she, who is she
Who's going to complete my world
Where is he, where is he
Where is this beautiful guy
Who is he, who is he
Who's going to take me so high

I know you're out there

Where are you
I'm going to look all over the world baby
Because I know you're out there
I know it might sound crazy but I think I love you

Where are you
