                        I, I want to go, I want to run, run to the places where I can be
I wanna know what is the sound
The sound out of the something reminding me
I want to go, I got to run
Run to the moment and set me free
You tell me boy I hear the sound
Sound of my dream.

So now,
Now is the time to make it right
Now is the time to feel the heat
This is my place I stay the night
Just move your body to the beat.
