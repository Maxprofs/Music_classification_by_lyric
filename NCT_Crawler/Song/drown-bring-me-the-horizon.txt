                        Bài hát: Drown - Bring Me The Horizon

What doesn't kill you 
Makes you wish you were dead 
Got a hole in my soul growing deeper and deeper 
And I can't take 
One more moment of this silence 
The loneliness is haunting me
And the weight of the worlds getting harder to hold up 
It comes in waves 
I close my eyes
Hold my breath 
And let it bury me 
I'm not alright 
And it's not ok 
Won't you drag the lake 
And bring me home again 
Who will fix me now?
Dive in when I'm down? 
Save me from myself, 
Don't let me drown 
Who will make me fight? 
Drag me out alive? 
Save me from myself, 
Don't let me drown 
What doesn't destroy you 
Leaves you broken instead. 
You know that I can't do this on my own.
                        
                    |
