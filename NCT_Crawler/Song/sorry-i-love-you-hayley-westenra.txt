                        Together hand in hand we walked through evening gloom
Long shadows on the pavement, cast from the sunset sky
If only this would last until the end of time
And if this is forever I swear that I could cry

The northern wind starts to blow
And the smell of winter’s in the air
As we take each step upon the ground
The season of love grows near

We could share the very first snowflowers of the year
In your arms where I belong
Watch as the city turns from grey to white
The day turns into night
Love that floats like wayward clouds, that’s not what we’re about
Sure and strong is my love for you
And it comes from the bottom of my heart

With you by my side, to catch me when I fall
I can cast my fears aside; feel twice as tall
If only this would last, this smile upon my face
And if this is forever, you’re my saving grace

The nights were so cold without you
And the days were always short on light
Now a fire’s warming me through
And suddenly this upturned world is feeling right

We could share the very first snowflowers of the year
In your arms where I belong
Watch as the city turns from grey to white
The day turns into night
Love that floats like wayward clouds, that’s not what we’re about
Sure and strong is my love for you
And it comes from the bottom of my heart

If there comes a time when you have lost your way
I’ll turn myself into a star to guide you through
If ever you find tears upon your face
I will be there, always be there for you

We could share the very first snowflowers of the year
In your arms where I belong
Watch as the city turns from grey to white
The day turns into night
Love that floats like wayward clouds, that’s not what we’re about
Sure and strong is my love for you
The city turns from grey to white
The day turns into night

We could share the very first snowflowers of the year
In your arms where I belong

Cold winds from the North blow
The sky casts its last glow
But you and I are standing strong
                        
                    |
