                        I gotta say what's on my mind
Something about us
Doesn't seem right these days
Life keeps getting in the way
Whenever we try
Somehow the plan
Is always rearranged

It's so hard to say
But I've got to do what's best for me
You'll be okay

[Chorus]
I've got to move on and be who I am
I just don't belong here
I hope you understand
We might find a place in this world someday
But at least for now
I gotta go my own way

Don't wanna leave it all behind
But I get my hopes up
And I watch them fall every time
Another color turns to gray
And it's just to hard
To watch it all
Slowly fade away

I'm leaving today
'Cause I gotta do what's best for me
You'll be okay

[Chorus]
I've got to move on and be who I am
I just don't belong here
I hope you understand
We might find a place in this world someday
But at least for now
I gotta go my own way

Zac-
What about us?
What about everything we've been through?

Vanessa-
What about trust?

Zac-
You know I never wanted to hurt you

Vanessa-
What about me?

Zac-
What am I supposed to do?

Vanessa-
I gotta leave but I'll miss you

Vanessa-
So, I've got to move on and be who I am

Zac-
Why do you have to go?

Vanessa-
I just don't belong here
I hope you understand

Zac-
I'm trying to understand

Vanessa-
We might find a place in this world someday
But at least for now

Zac-
I want you to stay

Vanessa-
I gotta go my own way (hold "way")
I've got to move on and be who I am (say during "way")

Zac-
What about us?

Vanessa-
I just don't belong here
I hope you understand

Zac-
I'm trying to understand

Vanessa-
We might find a place in this world someday (World someday)
But at least for now
I gotta go my own way
I gotta go my own way
I gotta go-my own way
                        
                    |
