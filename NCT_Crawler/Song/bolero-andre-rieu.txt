                        On the moon stage that floats in the darkness
I had a dream of you dancing there
The deep, deep wound of your heart
Don't bear them all one by one
Nobody will blame you
It's okay to be who you are


Let me hear the melody of the lovely, fragile ballerina that is played by your tiptoes
Fly up!
Your saddness will also find a place to be healed


Inside the dark room
The satisfying feelings overflow from the window of the heart
Dreams grow under the moon light
You frantically engrave the rhythm of hope
Dreams grow
You seem to be yourself
You flap your wings freely
And search for th answer that no one will ever know


Let me hear the melody of the lovely, fragile ballerina that is played by your tiptoes
Fly up!
Your saddness will also find a place to be healed


Oh...
Let you dance away
Don't you know, yeah
I'll stand by your side
Yeah...
Fly away, fly away, fly away, fly all the way to the top
Fly forever yeah yeah yeah


Forever I will continue to iluminate you
I will watch over your future
No matter where you go
I'll continue to wish for you
I'll protect so...


Let me hear the dazzling, heart-rending ballerina that shines by passion
The song of joy
You're never alone, so
Fly up with all your life's strength
Your place is here
Your place...
Is here.
