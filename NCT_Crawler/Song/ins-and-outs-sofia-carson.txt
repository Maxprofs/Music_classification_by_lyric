                        Bài hát: Ins And Outs - Sofia Carson

Yeah
Don't leave anything out, don't spare no details
And say what you want, I'm not fragile
'Cause I can promise (uh) that how I'm doing
No, I won't let your history get to the best of me (uh, huh, huh)

No, I (I) won't bring the gavel down on you
No, no, no, no, no, no no
No, no, no, no, no, no no
No, I (I) condition over to judge you
No, no, no, no, no, no no
No, no, no, no, no, no no

Tell me, tell me, tell me
All the ins and outs
They carry something, something (ah) to figure out
Discover your information, this intimate situation
Show me, show me, show me
All the ins and outs
'Cause it'll just make it easier to love you (uh, uh, uh, uh)

You got 21 questions, I got 21 answers
Open the pages, yeah, to unlock what's yours
Baby, don't let my history get to the best of you
And don't let my energy get to the rest of you (no, huh, huh)

No, I (I) won't bring the gavel down on you
No, no, no, no, no, no no
No, no, no, no, no, no no

Tell me, tell me, tell me
All the ins and outs
They carry something, something (ah) to figure out
Discover your information, this intimate situation
Show me, show me, show me
All the ins and outs
'Cause it'll just make it easier to love you

Ah, ah, ah, ah
Easier to touch you
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Easier to hold you
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Easier to love you
Ah, ah, ah, ah

Tell me, tell me, tell me
All the ins and outs
They carry something, something (ah) to figure out
Discover your information, this intimate situation
Show me, show me, show me
All the ins and outs
'Cause it'll just make it easier to love you

Ah, ah, ah, ah
Easier to touch you
Ah, ah, ah, ah
All the ins and outs
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Easier to love you
Ah, ah, ah, ah
All the ins and outs
