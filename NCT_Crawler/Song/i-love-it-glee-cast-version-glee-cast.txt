                        Tina and Kitty:
I got this feeling on the summer day when you were gone
I crashed my car into the bridge
I watched, I let it burn
I threw your stuff into a bag and pushed it down the stairs
I crashed my car into the bridge

Brittany, Kitty and Tina with New Direction Girls:
I don't care, I love it
I don't care!

I got this feeling on the summer day when you were gone
I crashed my car into the bridge
I watched, I let it burn
I threw your stuff into a bag and pushed it down the stairs
I crashed my car into the bridge

Brittany, Tina and Kitty with New Direction Girls:
I don't care, I love it
I don't care

Unique with New Direction Girls:
You're on a different road, I'm in the Milky Way
You want me down on Earth, but I am up in space
You're so damn hard to please, we gotta kill this switch
You're from the 70's (and New Directions Girls: but I'm a 90's bitch!)

Brittany, Tina and Kitty with New Direction Girls:
I love it!
I love it!

Tina and Kitty:
