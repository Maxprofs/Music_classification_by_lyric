                        Would you know my name?
if I saw you in Heaven
Would it be the same
if I saw you in Heaven

I must be strong and carry on
Cause I know I don't belong here in heaven

Would you hold my hand,
if I saw you in heaven
Would you help me stand,
if I saw you in heaven

I'll find my way through night and day
Cause I know I just can't stay here in heaven.

Time can bring you downTime can bend your knees
Time can break your heart
Have you beggin
please beggin please

Beyond the door, there's peace for sure
and I know there'll be no more tears in heaven.
Cause I know I don't belong here in heaven
                        
                    |
