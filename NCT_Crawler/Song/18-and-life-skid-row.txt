                        Ricky was a young boy
He had a heart of stone
Lived 9 to 5 and worked his
Fingers to the bone

Just barely out of school
Came from the edge of town
Fought like a switchblade
So no one could take him down

He had no money, ooh
No good at home
He walked the streets a soldier
And he fought the world alone
And now it's...

Chorus:
Eighteen and life you got it
Eighteen and life you know
Your crime is time and it's
Eighteen and life to go
Eighteen and life you got it
Eighteen and life you know
Your crime is time and it's
Eighteen and life to go

Tequila in his heartbeat
His veins burned gasoline
It kept his motor runnin'
But he never kept it clean

They say he loved adventure
Ricky's the wild on
He married trouble
Had a courtship with a gun

Bang, bang! Shoot 'em up
the party never ends
You can't think of dying
When the bottle's your best friend
And now it's...

Chorus

"Accidents will happen"
They all heard Ricky say
He fired his six-shot to the wind
That child blew a child away
                        
                    |
