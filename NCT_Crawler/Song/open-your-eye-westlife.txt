                        Bài hát: Open Your Heart - Westlife

I didn't mean to let you down
You have to believe it
I don't know what went through my mind
But now I can see

That I waited too long
To tell you how much it matters
Just to be right here with you
But I couldn't think of anything better
I should have told you so

Refrain:
Baby open your heart
Won't you give me a second chance
And I'll be here forever
Open your heart
Let me show you how much I care
And I will make you understand
If you open your heart
To love me once again

I'll try to make it up to you
I want you to know (you have to know)
Baby I swear that I'll be true
And never let go

That I waited too long
To tell you how much it matters
Just to be right here with you
But I couldn't think of anything better
I should have told you so

(Refrain)

We could relive this pain and sorrow
(But we better do it in time)
Start over here and save tomorrow
I wanna make you mine

(Open your heart, give me a second chance, and I'll be here forever) forever
(Open your heart, how much I care)
And I will make you understand
If you open your heart
To love me once again

(Refrain)
                        
                    |
