                        In a lifetime, made of memories
 I believe in destiny
 Every moment returns again in time
 When I've got the future on my mind
 Know that you'll be the only one Meet me halfway across the sky
 Out where the world belongs to only you and I
 Meet me halfway across the sky
 Make this a new beginning of another life In a lifetime there is only love
 Reachin' for the lonely one
 We are stronger when we are given love
 When we put emotions on the line
 Know that we are the timeless ones Meet me halfway across the sky
 Out where the world belongs to only you and I
 Meet me halfway across the sky
 Make this a new beginning of another life Meet me halfway across the sky
 Out where the world belongs to only you and I
 Meet me halfway across the sky
 Make this a new beginning of another life
 Meet me halfway across the sky
