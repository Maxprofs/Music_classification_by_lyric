Backstreet Boys---Back To Your Heart
It's not that I can't live without you
It's just that I don't even want to try
Every night I dream about you
Ever since the day we said goodbye
If I wasn't such a fool
Right now I'd be holding you
There's nothing that I wouldn't do
Baby if I only knew
The words to say, The road to take
To find a way back to your heart
What can I do, To get to you
And find a way back to your heart
I don't know how it got so crazy
But I'll do anything to set things right
Cause your love is so amazing
Baby you're the best thing in my life
Let me prove my love is real
And made you feel the way I feel
I promise I would give the world
If only you would tell me girl
The words to say, The road to take
To find a way back to your heart
What can I do, To get to you
And find a way back to your heart
Give me one more chance
Give me one more chance
Give my love to you, give my love, my love
Cause no one on this earth loves you like I do,
Tell me
The words to say, The road to take
To find a way back to your heart
What can I do, To get to you
And find a way back to your heart
I turn back time, To make you mine
And find a way back to your heart
I beg and plead, Fall to my knees
To find a way back to your heart
The words to say, The road to take
To find a way back to your heart
What can I do, To get to you
And find a way back to your heart
BACK TO YOUR HEART!...
