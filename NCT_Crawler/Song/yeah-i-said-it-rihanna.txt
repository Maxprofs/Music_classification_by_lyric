                        Bài hát: Yeah, I Said It - Rihanna


[Intro]
Yeah yeah
Yeah yeah

[Verse 1]
I ain't trying to think about it, no
Yeah I said it boy get up inside it
I want you to homicide it
Going slow I want you to pop it
Anything can kinda like ya
Up against the wall we don't need a title

[Chorus 1]
Yeah I said it, yeah I said it baby
Yeah I said it, yeah I said it *** a title

[Verse 2]
Boy I always like to show
Get a little bit, come a little close no
Take it home on your camera phone
Get a little bit, nigga watch me blow it down

[Chorus 2]
Yeah I said it, yeah I said it baby, yeah I said it
Yeah I said it, yeah I said it baby, yeah I said it

[Bridge]
You could be rough boy but you won't
Give me some love, boy give it to me 'til the morn'

[Chorus 2]
Yeah I said it, yeah I said it baby, yeah I said it
Yeah I said it, yeah I said it baby, yeah I said it
