                        Bài hát: Don't Let Me Down Remix - The Chainsmokers, Daya

[Verse 1]
Crashing, hit a wall
Right now I need a miracle
Hurry up now, I need a miracle
Stranded, reaching out
I call your name but you're not around
I say your name but you're not around

[Chorus]
I need you, I need you, I need you right now
Yeah, I need you right now
So don't let me, don't let me, don't let me down
I think I'm losing my mind now
It's in my head, darling I hope
That you'll be here, when I need you the most
So don't let me, don't let me, don't let me down
D-Don't let me down

[Post-Chorus: Instrumental]
Don't let me down
Don't let me down, down, down
Don't let me down, don’t let me down, down, down

[Verse 2]
R-r-running out of time
I really thought you were on my side
But now there's nobody by my side

[Chorus]
I need you, I need you, I need you right now
Yeah, I need you right now
So don't let me, don't let me, don't let me down
I think I'm losing my mind now
It's in my head, darling I hope
That you'll be here, when I need you the most
So don't let me, don't let me, don't let me down
D-Don't let me down

[Post-Chorus: Instrumental]
Don't let me down
Don't let me down, down, down
Don't let me down, down, down
Don't let me down, down, down
Don't let me down, don’t let me down, down, down

[Bridge]
Oh, I think I’m losing my mind now, yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh, I think I’m losing my mind now, yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
I need you, I need you, I need you right now
Yeah, I need you right now
So don't let me, don't let me, don't let me down
I think I'm losing my mind now
It's in my head, darling I hope
That you'll be here, when I need you the most
So don't let me, don't let me, don't let me down
Don't let me down

[Outro]
Yeah, don't let me down
Yeah, don't let me down
Don't let me down, oh no
Said don't let me down
Don't let me down
Don't let me down
Don't let me down, down, down

Don't Let Me Down
