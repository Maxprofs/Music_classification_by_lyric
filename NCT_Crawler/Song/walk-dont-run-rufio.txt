                        I see the sand fall through my hand
 A subtle picture, quiet reminder
 We're staring through this hour glass
 When will it run out? When will we run out? We've learned to build our castles out of sand for so long
 So temporary, I watch them tumble down It's time to let it go
 Turn back the hand to the beginning
 Wouldn't it be nice, give me some more time Bury yourself under the blanket
 How do we slow down?
 How do we walk when we're supposed to run? Surround ourselves with plastic bonds
 It give us comfort, comfort in numbers
 These monuments will always stand
 Our lonely temples lean too, we'll all fall Try to appreciate what little time we have, let's slow it down
 Life's so uncertain, we lay our brother's down It's time to let it go
 Turn back the hand to the beginning
 Wouldn't it be nice, give me some more time Bury yourself under the blanket
 How do we slow down?
 How do we walk when we're supposed to run? Don't let life pass you by tonight
 Brace inside, brace yourself this time Now I know it's time to let it go
 Turn back those hands to the beginning
 Wouldn't it be nice, give me some more time Bury yourself under the blanket
 How do we slow down?
 How do we walk when we're supposed to run?
