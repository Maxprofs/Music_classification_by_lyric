                        When you taught me how to dance
Years ago with misty eyes
Every step and silent glance
Every move a sweet surprise

Someone must have taught you well
To beguile and to entrance
For that night you cast your spell
And you taught me how to dance

Light reflections in a lake
I recall what went before
As I give, I'll learn to take
And to be alone no more

Other lights may light my way
I may even find romance
But I won't forget that night
When you taught me how to dance

Cold winds blow
But on those hills you'll find me
And I know
You're walking right behind me

When you taught me how to dance
Years ago with misty eyes
Every step and silent glance
Every move a sweet surprise

Someone must have taught you well
o beguile and to entrance
For that night you cast your spell
And you taught me how to dance
And you taught me how to dance.
