                        Bài hát : Until It's Gone - Linkin Park

A fire needs a space to burn,
A breath to build a glow.
I've heard it said a thousand times,
But now I know.

That you don't know what you've got,
Oh you don't know what you've got,
No you don't know what you've got,
Until It's Gone
Until It's Gone
Until It's Gone.

I thought I kept you safe and sound,
I thought i made you strong.
But something made me realize,
That I was wrong.
'Cause finding what you got sometimes,
Means finding it alone.
And I can finally see your light,
When I let go.

'Cause you don't know whats you've got,
'Til It's Gone
Until It's Gone
'Til It's Gone

What's up
Until It's Gone
Until It's Gone
Until It's Gone
'Til It's Gone

'Cause you don't know what you've got,
Oh you don't know what you've got,
No you don't know what you've got,
It's your battle to be fought,
No you don't know what you've got,
'Til It's Gone
'Til It's Gone
'Til It's Gone
                        
                    |
