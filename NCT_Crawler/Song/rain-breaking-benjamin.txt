                        Take a photograph
 It'll be the last
 Not a dollar or a crowd
 Could ever keep me here I don't have a past
 I just have a chance
 Not a family or honest
 Plea remains to say Rain, rain go away
 Come again another day
 All the world is waitin' for the sun Is it you I want
 Or just the notion of
 Your heart to wrap around
 So I can find the way around Safe to say from here
 You're getting closer now
 We're never sad
 'Cause we are not allowed to be Rain, rain go away
 Come again another day
 All the world is waitin' for the sun Rain, rain go away
 Come again another day
 All the world is waitin' for the sun To lie here under you
 Is all that I could ever do
 To lie here under you is all
 To lie here under you
 Is all that I could ever do
 To lie here under you is all Rain, rain go away
 Come again another day
 All the world is waitin' for the sun Rain, rain go away
 Come again another day
 All the world is waitin' for the sun All the world is waitin' for the sun
 All the world is waitin' for the sun
                        
                    |
