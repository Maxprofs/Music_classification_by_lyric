Yo G they can't stop me from rapping can they?
Can they huh?
I spit it through the wire man
To much stuff on my heart right now man
I'll probably risk it all right now
It's a life or death situation man
Y'all don't really understand how I feel right now man
It's your boy Kayne to the....
Chi-Town what's going on man

[Verse 1]
I drink a Boost for breakfast, and Ensure for dizzert
Somebody ordered pancakes I just sip the sizzurp
That right there could drive a sane man beserk
Not to worry the Mr. H to the Izz-O's back to wizzerk
How do you console my mom or give her light support
Telling her your sons' on life support
And just imagine how my girl feel
On the plane scared as hell that her guy look like Ed Mitill
She was with me before the deal she been trying to be mine
She a delta so she been throwing that dynasty sign
No use of me tryna be lyin
I been trying to be signed
Trying to be a millionaire
How I use two lifelines
In the same hospital where Big and Tupac died
The doctor said I had blood clots
But I ain't Jamaican man
Story on MTV and I ain't trying to make a band
I swear this right here, history in the making man

I really apologize how I sound right now man
This ain't fair at all man
They got my mouth wired shut for like I don't know
the doctor said for like six weeks
You know we had reconstru....
I had reconstructive surgery on my jaw
Looked in the mirror half my jaw was missing and half my mouth
I couldn't believe it
But im still here for yall right now man
This is what I gotta say yo

[Verse 2]
Yeah, turn me up yeah
What if somebody from the Chi that was ill got a deal
\on the hottest rap label around but he wasn't talking bout coke
and birds it was more like spoken word
Except he really putting it down
And he explained the story about how blacks came from glory
And what we need to do in the game
Good dude, Bad night, Right place, Wrong time
In the blink of an eye his whole life changed
If you could feel how my face felt you would know how Mase felt
Thank God I ain't too cool for the safe belt
I swear to God drive a two on the sue
I got lawyer for the case to keep whats in my safe-safe
My dawgs couldn't tell if I, I look Tom Cruise on Vanilla Sky
All they heard was in accident like GEICO
They thought I was burnt up like Pepsi did Michael I must gotta angel
Cause look how death missed his ass Unbreakable,
would you thought they called me Mr.
Glass Look back on my life like the ghost of Christmas past
Toys R Us where I used to spend that Christmas cash
And I still wont grow up, I'm a grown ass kid
Swear I should be locked up for stupid *** that I did
But I'm a champion, so I turned tragedy to triumph
Make music that's fire, spit my soul through the wire

Know what im saying
When the doctor told me I had a um..
I was goin to have a plate on my chin
I said dawg don't you realize I'll never make it on the plane now
Its bad enough I got all this jewelry on
Can't be serious man
