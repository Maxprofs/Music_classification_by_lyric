                        [Intro:]
 Hey baby
 I wish you could see what I have on right now
 You so s***
 Imagine how intense it would be to hold me right now
 Our song's playing

 [Verse 1 (Beyonce)]
 At night when you're far and I'm alone
 I feel the fabric from your t-shirt
 Close To My Body...
 I can still hear your baritone
 In my ear telling me you'll take it slow,
 And I was in the mirror playing role
 Like you were here, I couldn't turn me on,
 So I fell asleep with the music on,
 Woke up again hearing the same old song, playing

 [ Bridge (Kelly) ]
 (Oh) Give it to me deeper
 (Oh) You giving me the fever
 (Oh) Now you got my feet up
 This one is a keeper
 Now the second verse is playing
 (Oh) Won't we try to stand up
 (Oh) Hold me while my hands up
 (Oh) And the music picks up
 Fantasies were shook up
 I'm thinking to myself again

 [ Chorus ]
 When you're not here (I sleep in your t-shirt)
 I wish you were here (To take off your t-shirt)
 After we make love (I sleep in your t-shirt)
 Wake up in your t-shirt
 Still smell the scent of your cologne
 When I need your feel (I sleep in your t-shirt)
 I need you help (to take off your t-shirt)
 After we make love (I sleep in your t-shirt)
 Wake up in your t-shirt,
 Still smell the scent of your cologne

 [ verse 2 (Beyonce) ]
 Outside, I hear the rain on my windowpane
 Hold up a minute, thought I heard your name
 My mind, playing tricks on me again
 I hear knocks at the door, is that my baby home
 Why, couldn't it be reality
 Looked at the clock and it says 4: 03
 At 9, he'll be arriving on a plane
 Then we'll be making love and hearing the song again

 [ Bridge (Kelly)]

 [ Chorus ]

 [ Michelle ]
 Oh boy I've been waiting
 Now my body's shaking
 You're so deep, baby please, take it easy
 I look at your face and
 Got my heart racing
 You're so deep, baby please, take it easy

 [ Talking (Beyonce)]
 Keep it right there,
 Oh, wait, wait, yeah
 Keep it right there
 You driving me crazy

 [ Chorus ]
                        
                    |
