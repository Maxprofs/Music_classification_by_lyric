R&B/Hip Hop/Rap|

                        It's that L to the I to the Z Z O
 Ain't got no time for the C3p0, wookie/rookie
 Never knock nookie, but I'd rather stack cookies
 Looking at the sunset the color of Snookie
 Woman of the year, Huzzah! Huzzah! Huzzah!
 Gimmie three cheers
 Killin everyone up in the coven, witch
 Cuttin all these niggas, better sew up, stitch
 Will Smithin' these hoes, you know how it works
 Punch a brotha out and say "Welcome to Earth"
 I drop a mil, take off a scarf
 Locs on my face like 'i make this look good'
 Ugh! Capitalize your capital, with a capital G
 I'm giving out my secrets, man ya'll better pay me
 Sucky people marry suckers then they suck
 Then they have sucky kids they grow up, then what
 They attend all the sucky universities
 And spend our money like it grows on trees
 Siphon to the authorities then get confused when we
 Conglomerate to the inner cities
 Perched on streets
 Looking super sketchy
 Skid marks on their knees
 Their hands in their pockets
 They walking by real fast incase we got that rocket
 Boom! Slam the door to their apartment
 That sucky wife is pregnant with another suck-ass kid
 I'm askin!
 When will it end?
 Waiting on the meteor shower to rain down and bring all these suck niggas to their final hour

 Don't tell us to slow it down, we won't listen
 We're twenty-somethings and it's twenty something
 Greenrooms drugs and liquor and hiphop
 We're twenty somethings and it's twenty something
 (It's the end of the world)

 Rumors that world's gonna end don't faze me
 I'mma get faded, I'mma get faded
