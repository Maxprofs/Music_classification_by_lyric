                        I mean was it me or was it you?
was it love? still don't get it ... still can't see ...

Separation does not want to believe this to come
I feel this strange winter alI
Jingle Bells each one sounds cute couples I really want to cry
Snow piled up in the busy streets of sorrow I walked and walked toward
Even the belts you see a friend in the wound is always sorrowful farewell
Now what do I think you do
We do regret heeojingeol

I do every day ~
Many thought
I do every day ~
Many mistaken
Do not have time to relax my mind

White snow white snow came down down
All blissfully smile and I'm left alone in the winter neoeopneun
They do not survive a day
Only love one only God's love to come back to me please
You have not yet left a little love, who do not have damgien
still with you

(Rap)
You sound too much wear on me and then felt bad and sick leave
Wear sound No i can `t believe ... what's the reason
We have to end so easily between
Someone else besides me ever had?
Or did you get tired of our love
I'm losing you lost in transaction ...
damn it girl why can `t you feel my pain ~

2)
What is the reason why a nice person to meet me, 

So I do not know

White snow white snow came down down
Both also blissfully funny
Left alone in the winter without you I do not own one day hold
God Please give me one love One love to come back
Neoahnin who still love the rest do not have any damn
I'm still with you
Now, you'll erase it gonna bury 'em in the chest
All of them in the snow nokilge
You do not want to keep that much harder, I guess I'm sorry I can not forget
Snow in the world have gathered together all the candles I tell my heart grow
Until today I cry for you, thank you, sincerely loved ~
