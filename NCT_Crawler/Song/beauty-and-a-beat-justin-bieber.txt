Justin..

S how you off
Tonight I wanna show you off (aye,aye,aye)
What you got
A billion could've never bought (aye,aye,aye)

We gonna party like it's 3012 tonight
I wanna show you all the finer things in life
So just forget about the world, we're young tonight
I'm coming for ya, I'm coming for ya

Cause all..
I need, is a Beauty and a Beat
Who can make my life complete
It's all..
Bout you, when the music makes you move
Baby do it like you do
Cause..

[Beat break]

Body rock,
Girl, I can feel your body rock (aye,aye,aye)
Take a bow, you on the hottest ticket now (aye,aye,aye)

We gonna party like it's 3012 tonight
I wanna show you all the finer things in life
So just forget about the world, we're young tonight
I'm coming for ya, I'm coming for ya

Cause all..
I need, is a Beauty and a Beat
Who can make my life complete
It's all..
Bout you, when the music makes you move
Baby do it like you do

[Nicki Minaj]
Uh, Uh
In time, ink lines, b-bitches couldn't get on my incline
World tour, it's mine, ten little letters, on a big sign
Justin.. Bieber, you know Imma hit 'em with the ether
Buns out, weiner, but I gotta keep an eye out for Selena
Beauty, Beauty and the Beast
Beauty from the east, beautiful confessions of the priest
Beast, beauty from the streets, we don't get deceased
Every time a beauty on the beats
(Body rock, girl, I wanna feel your body rock)
(Yeah, Yeah, yeah, Let's go, Let's go!)

Cause all..
I need, is a Beauty and a Beat
Who can make my life complete
It's all..
Bout you, when the music makes you move
Baby do it like you do
Cause...
