                        Bài hát: Moon River - Pixie Lott

Moon River, wider than a mile
I'm crossing you in style someday
Oh, dream maker you heartbreaker
Wherever you're going, I'm going your way

Two drifters out to see the world
There's such a lot of world to see
We're after the same rain mosses
Waiting round the bend, my Huckleberry friend
Moon River

Two drifters out to see the world
There's such a lot of world to see
We're after the same rain mosses
Waiting round the bend, my Huckleberry friend
Moon River, and me
                        
                    |
