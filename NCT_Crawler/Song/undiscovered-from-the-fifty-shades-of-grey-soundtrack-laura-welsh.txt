                        [Verse 1]
 You're the only one that I've got
 But I can't get lost in you
 I can't get lost in you

 It can be someone that I know
 To make it up to you
 Make it up to you
 Oooh ooh ooooh
 Oooh ooh ooooh

 [Chorus]
 You're undiscovered
 I wanna see the rest of you
 I can't get next to you
 I can't get next to you

 You're undiscovered
 I wanna see the rest of you
 I can't get next to you
 I can't get next to you

 [Verse 1]
 You don't wanna look ahead
 When it's staring back at you
 Staring back at you

 Oooh ooh ooooh
 Oooh ooh ooooh
 Baby I'm about to lose
 Oooh ooh ooooh
 But I can't decipher you
 Oooh ooh ooooh 

 [Chorus]
 You're undiscovered
 I wanna see the rest of you
 I can't get next to you
 I can't get next to you

 You're undiscovered
 I wanna see the rest of you
 I can't get next to you
 I can't get next to you

 [Bridge]
 It's evident that you never were fully person
 In a composition
 Holding in what you really want
 Left no evidence that you were listening

 It's evident that you never were fully person
 In a composition
 Holding in what you really want
 Left no evidence that you were listening (you were listening)

 [Chorus]
 You're undiscovered
 I wanna see the rest of you
 I can't get next to you
 I can't get next to you

 You're undiscovered
 I wanna see the rest of you
 I can't get next to you
 I can't get next to you

 You're undiscovered
 I wanna see the rest of you
 I can't get next to you
 I can't get next to you

 You're undiscovered
 I wanna see the rest of you
 I can't get next to you
 I can't get next to you
                        
                    |
