                        Bài hát: Undiscovered (From The “Fifty Shades Of Grey” Soundtrack) - Laura Welsh

You’re the only one that I’ve got
But I can’t get lost to you
I can’t get lost to you
Can’t be someone that I am not
To make it up to you
Make it up to you

Who moves
Who moves

You’re undiscovered
I wanna see the rest of you
I can’t get next to you
I can’t get next to you
You’re undiscovered
I wanna see the rest of you
I can’t get next to you
I can’t get next to you

You don’t wanna look ahead
When It’s staring back at you
Staring back at you

Who moves
Who moves
Maybe I’ve got more to lose
Who moves
But I can’t decide for you
Who moves

You’re undiscovered
I wanna see the rest of you
I can’t get next to you
I can’t get next to you
You’re undiscovered
I wanna see the rest of you
I can’t get next to you
I can’t get next to you

It’s evident that you never were fully present in our conversations
holding in what you really meant left no evidence that you were listening
It’s evident that you never were fully present in our conversations
holding in what you really meant left no evidence that you were listening

You’re undiscovered
I wanna see the rest of you
I can’t get next to you
I can’t get next to you
You’re undiscovered
I wanna see the rest of you
I can’t get next to you
I can’t get next to you
You’re undiscovered
I wanna see the rest of you
I can’t get next to you
I can’t get next to you
You’re undiscovered
I wanna see the rest of you
I can’t get next to you
I can’t get next to you
                        
                    |
