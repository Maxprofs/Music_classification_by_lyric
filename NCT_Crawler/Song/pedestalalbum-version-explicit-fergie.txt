                        Your pedestal is falling down, falling down, falling down
 Your pedestal is falling down, da da da da da da da da da da

 [Verse 1:]
 Record sales are on the mark
 'cause that's about the time the rumors start
 Where all the people talking out of their ass
 Well, someone's gotta school ya cause ya got no class
 Well I've paid my dues
 I'm a seasoned dame
 So why you gotta throw salt in my game
 You hide behind the computer screens so that you don't have to be seen
 How could a person be so mean

 [chorus:]
 Who are you-and what do you do
 That makes you think you're above me
 But have you walked in my shoes
 The pedestal
 You put yourself on
 Well since I'm breaking it down now
 It's gon collapse and be gone-gone-gone-gone-gone

 Probably one of them tag a longs down 4 the free t-shirt
 'cause you're a hanger on
 You think you got me figured out
 Never met me have no clue what I'm about
 Maybe I got things you wish you had
 You need to stop the hate and get a pen and pad
 I work around the clock, so fill your mouth up with a sock
 And get you head up off your jock
 Tell me who you are and what your background is
 Tell me how you're feelin' when you listen to this

 [Chorus:]

 [Bridge:]
 Your pedestal is falling down, falling down, falling down
 Your pedestal is falling down, dum dum dum dum
 Your pedestal is falling down, falling down, falling down
 Your pedestal is falling down, da da da da da da da da da da da
 Tell me who you are and what your background is
 Tell me how you're feelin' when you listen to this
 You think I don't see you on the internet, I read it, don't think I wont forget

 [chorus x2]
                        
                    |
