                        Bài hát : Something You Need - Against The Current

That night I still remember
It was warm in the middle of summer
Your voice like a lullaby, so low, so sweet
Thought you had me but I’d never been so free

Now you’re scared but you don’t know why
You keep running but there’s nowhere to hide

[Chorus:]
You never thought I’d ever be
Something you want, something you need
Uh, oh, we got lost in the summer heat
Now you just can’t get over me

We’ll spend the night watching movies in the dark
You’re playing bands I’ve never heard of
And I know you tend to always overthink
But tonight it’s as simple as just kiss me

Now you’re scared but you don’t know why
You keep running but there’s nowhere to hide
Scared to care because then you lose
Try and hide how you feel but I feel it, too

[Chorus]

Take all of your doubts and throw them away
We’re falling tonight tell me that you’ll stay
You’ll stay

[Chorus x2]
                        
                    |
