                        Bài hát: Wavin' Flag - K'naan

Give me freedom, give me fire, give me reason, take me higher 
See the champions, take the field now, you define us, make us feel proud 
In the streets our hands are lifting as we lose our inhabition, 
Celebration its around us, every nations, all around us 

Singin forever young, singin songs underneath the sun 

Lets rejoice in the beautiful game. 

And together at the end of the day. 

WE ALL SAY 

When I get older I will be stronger 
They'll call me freedom 
Just like a wavin' flag 

And then it goes back 
And then it goes back 
And then it goes back 
And then it goes 

When I get older I will be stronger 
They'll call me freedom 
Just like a wavin' flag 

And then it goes back 
And then it goes back 
And then it goes back 
And then it goes 
Oooooooooooooh woooooooooohh hohoho 

[Repeat all] 

WE ALL SAY ! 

When I get older I will be stronger 
They'll call me freedom 
Just like a wavin' flag 

And then it goes back 
And then it goes back 
And then it goes back 

When I get older I will be stronger 
They'll call me freedom 
Just like a wavin' flag 

And then it goes back 
And then it goes back 
And then it goes 

Wooo hooooo hohohohoooooo 

And everybody will be singinit 

Wooooooooo ohohohooooo 

And we are all singinit
