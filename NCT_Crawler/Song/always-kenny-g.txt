Girl you are to me
All that a woman should be
and I dedicate my life to you, always
A love like yours is rare
It must have been sent from up above
and I know you'll stay this way, for always
And we both know
That our love will grow
and forever it will be you and me
Ooh, You're like the sun
Chasing all the rain away
When you come around
You bring brighter days
You're the perfect one for me
and you forever will be
and I will love you so, for always
Come with me my sweet
Let's go make a family
and they will bring us joy for always
Oh boy I love you so
I can't find enough ways to let you know
But you can be sure, I'm yours, for always
And we both know
That our love will grow
and forever it will be you and me
Ooh, You're like the sun
Chasing all the rain away
When you come around
You bring brighter days
You're the perfect one for me
and you forever will be
and I will love you so, for always

Ooh, You're like the sun
Chasing all the rain away
When you come around
You bring brighter days
You're the perfect one for me
and you forever will be
and I will love you so, for always
Ooh~~
