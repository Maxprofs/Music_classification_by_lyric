                        Outside of the party where it's gettin' too loud
 It feels like we're the only ones alone in the crowd
 Chat college and politics in time that we spend
 You look back and you say you think you lost all your friends
 And I'm hoping that it's all my fault
 Yeah, I'm hoping that it's all my fault Hey, let's not be alone tonight
 Hey, let's not be alone tonight (You don't have to be alone)
 No it don't, no it don't mean love
 But it might, but it might be love
 Hey, let's not be alone tonight (You don't have to be alone) Not wrong if you come on strong, 'cause life is too short
 I like how we get along like snow and New York
 All good if you change your mind, you know where I stand
 Look back and I say to you I lost all my friends
 And I know you know it's all your fault
 Yeah, I know you know it's all your fault Hey, let's not be alone tonight
 Hey, let's not be alone tonight (You don't have to be alone)
 No it don't, no it don't mean love
 But it might, but it might be love
 Hey, let's not be alone tonight (You don't have to be alone) And I know it's gotta be my fault
 Yeah, I know it's gotta be my fault La la la la la
 La la la la la, yeah
 La la la la la
 La la la la la, yeah
 La la la la la
 La la la la la
 La la la la la
 La la la la la Hey, let's not be alone tonight (You don't have to be alone)
 Hey, let's not be alone tonight (You don't have to be alone)
 No it don't, no it don't mean love
 But it might, but it might be love
 Hey, let's not be alone tonight (You don't have to be, hey!)
 You don't have to be alone tonight 
 Hey, You don't have to be alone tonight (You don't have to be alone) No it don't, no it don't mean love
 But it might, but it might be love
 Hey, let's not be alone tonight (You don't have to be alone)
