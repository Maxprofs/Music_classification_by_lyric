                        Bài hát: Red Lights - Tiesto

Blacked out,
everything faded on your love,
I’m already wasted so close
that I can taste it now... now...

So let’s break right out of these guilty cages
we’re going to make it now...
don’t ever turn around
don’t ever turn around

Nobody else needs to know
where we might go...
We could just run them red lights
we could just run them red lights

There ain’t no reason to stay
we’ll be light years away...
We could just run them red lights
we could just run them red lights

We could just run them red lights
we could just run them red lights

White lights, flirt in the darkness
this road leads where your heart is
these signs, something we can’t ignore

We can’t back down
we’ll never let them change us
we’re going to make it now
what are we waiting for...
what are we waiting for...

Nobody else needs to know
where we might go...
We could just run them red lights
we could just run them red lights

There ain’t no reason to stay
we’ll be light years away...

We could just run them red lights
we could just run them red lights

We could just run them red lights
we could just run them red lights
                        
                    |
