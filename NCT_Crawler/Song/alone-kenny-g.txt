You don`t care for me,
you don`t carry where I have been,
I`ve done all I could,
so that I could be with you.
Anyway you want,
I do everhing you need,
Maybe now you can see,
that our love was went to be.
But I was so wrong,
always thought I could be strong.
When you left me here,
you took my heart away dear.
I feel so alone,
I’ve miss you so long.
I just can’t carry on,
feeling lost at all alone.
You love me with a whole broken heart,
left me here thinking why we fall apart.
But I was so wrong,
always thought I could be strong.
When you left me here,
you took my heart away dear.
I feel so alone,
I’ve miss you so long.
I just can’t carry on,
feeling lost at all alone.
You love me with a whole broken heart,
left me here thinking why we fall apart.
But I was so wrong,
always thought I could be strong.
When you left me here,
you took my heart away dear.
I feel so alone,
I’ve miss you so long.
I just can’t carry on,

You love me with a whole broken heart,
left me here thinking why we fall apart.
You love me with a whole broken heart,
left me here thinking why we fall apart.
