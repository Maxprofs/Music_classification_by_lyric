                        Bài hát: Sure Thing (Live) - BlackPink

Love you like a brother 
Treat you like a friend 
Respect you like a lover 

You could bet that 
Never gotta sweat that (x4) 

If you be the cash 
I'll be the rubberband 
You be the match 
Imma be your fuse 
Boom! 
Painter baby you 
Could be the muse 
I'm the reporter baby 
You could be the news 
Cause your the cigarrette 
And I'm the smoker 
We raise a bet... 
Cause your a joker 
Truth told 
You are the chalk 
And I could be the blackboard 
And you can be the talk 
And I could be the walk 

Even when the sky comes falling 
Even when the sun don't shine 
I got faith in you and I 
So put your pretty little hand in mine 
Even when we're down to the wire babe 
Even when it's do or die 
We can do it baby simple and plain 
This love is a sure thing 

You could bet that 
Never got to sweat that (x4) 

You could be the lover 
I'll be the fighter babe 
If I'm the blunt 
You could be the lighter babe 
Fire it up! 
Writer babe 
You could be the quote 
If I'm the lyric baby 
You could be the note 
Record that! 
Saint, I'm a sinner 
Prize, I'm a winner 
And it's you 
What can I do to deserve that 
Paper baby 
I'll be the pen 
Say that I'm the one 
Cause you are a ten 

Even when the sky comes fallin 
Even when the sun don't shine 
I got faith in you and I 
So put your pretty lil hand in mine 
Even when were down to the wire baby 
Even when it's do or die 
We can do it babe simple and plain 
Cause this love is a sure thing 

[Rock with me baby 
Let me hold you in my arms 
Talk to with me baby (x2)]

I fall in love every single time 
I look into your eyes those eyes they never lie 
I can tell your mine its so hard when you're not around 
I get mad thinking how I can't always have you around 
I wanna make you spend the whole day with me boy 
Play me like you toy, I'm all yours to enjoy 
Hoping this moment lasts long and forever 
I got no fear what so ever you're my one and only lover 
Roll a dice I bet it twice 
Don't think I can live a life without 
You in it you can bet that never sweat that you know what I'm best at 
Ready or not 
I'm gon have you by tonight 
I call the shot won't you be my kryptonite 
Love you like a brother 
Treat you like a friend 
Respect you like a lover
