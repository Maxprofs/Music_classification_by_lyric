No, this is not a test
Never was
Never will be
You can take my best
It's yours
It was never for me

I'm just looking for something
To get me out of my seat
Something that's true
What did I do

Cause every time I turn around
I'm back down to one
Tell me why it feels like
I'm still on the run

I need some good news baby
Feels like the world's gone crazy
Give me some good news baby
Give it to me
Give it to me

I need some good news baby
Cause all the world's gone crazy
I need some good news baby
Give it to me
Give it to me

I've been holding back
When I - I should be falling free, yea
But it's not having faith
Just believing what you can see

And I'm still looking for something
To get me out of my seat
Something that's true
What can I do

Cause every time I turn around
I'm back down to one
Tell me why it feels like
I'm still on the run

I need some good news baby
Feels like the world's gone crazy
Give me some good news baby
Give it to me
Give it to me

I need some good news baby
Cause all the world's gone crazy
I need some good news baby
Give it to me
Give it to me

Give it all or
Give me up
I won't settle for enough
It's the highs and it's the lows we remember, oooh

Give it all or
Give me up
I won't settle for enough
It's the highs and it's the lows we remember, remember

I need some good news baby
It’s like the world's gone crazy
Give me some good news baby
Give it to me
Give it to me

I need some good news baby
Cause all the world's gone crazy
I need some good news baby
Give it to me
Give it to me

Give me some good news baby, oh
I need some good news baby
Give it to me
Give it to me

Give it all or
Give me up
I won't settle for enough
It's the highs and it's the lows we remember, oooh
