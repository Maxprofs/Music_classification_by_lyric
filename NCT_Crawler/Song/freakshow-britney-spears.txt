10 PM to 4
And I came to hit the floor
Thought you knew before
But if you don't then now you know
Well tonight I'm 'bout to mash?
Make them other chicks so mad
I'm 'bout to shake my ass
Watch that boy?
It's all about me and you
Doin' how we do
Tear the floor up, up, up
Tell them to make room
They wanna know, tell them I'm alone
They wanna look, we can give 'em an
encore
Make it a freakshow, freak
Freakshow
We can give 'em a
Peep peep show, peep peep show
Peep show
Don't stop and let it flow
Let your inhibitions go
It's crazy now
Let's make them make a freakshow
Make it a freak show, freak
Freakshow, freakshow
Make it a freakshow, freak
Freakshow, a freakshow
Make them clap when we perform
Wanna be crazy we can show 'em
Dancin' table top freak, freaky
So outside the norm
I'm some superstar ish, ish
Christian hot, Bugatti whips
Hope the new designer fits
We can do it if you wish?
It's all about me and you
Doin' how we do
Tear the floor up, up, up
Tell them to make room
They wanna know, tell them I'm alone
They wanna look, we can give 'em an
encore
Make it a freakshow, freak
Freakshow
We can give 'em a
Peep peep show, peep peep show
Peep show
Don't stop and let it flow
Let your inhibitions go
It's crazy now
Let's make them make a freakshow
Make it a freakshow, freak
Freakshow, freakshow
Make it a freakshow, freak
Freakshow, a freakshow
Me and my girls like to get it on
Grab us a couple boys to go
Said me and my girls like to get it on
Grab us a couple boys to go
Me and my girls like to get it on
Grab us a couple boys to go
Said me and my girls like to get it on
Grab us a couple boys to go
Freakshow...
Me and my girls...
Make it a freakshow, freak
Freakshow
We can give 'em a
Peep peep show, peep peep show
Peep show
Don't stop and let it flow
Let your inhibitions go
It's crazy now
Let's make them make a freakshow
Make it a make it a
Me and my girls like to get it on
Grab us a couple boys to go
Said me and my girls like to get it on
Grab us a couple boys to go
