Janet Jackson - Curtains

BY Larry Cheng & Kevin Boul

You seen my show
You followed my tour
I heard you scream
With eighty thousand more
But tonight
I close up my door
In your room
Know I pull em
Out of the crowd
And guess who

The band is in place
The cameras are set
Make sure we tape it
So you don't forget

I'm a take the road
Take it slow so don't move
It's bout to come down
So just wait for my cue

House lights go low
Spotlight up more
It's time so just sit back
And enjoy the show

Time to close the curtains
Come up on the stage and sing
Before the show starts Mic check
Tonight is so exclusive
We should make it Pay-Per-View

Time to close the curtains
I only take requests from you
Just tell me what you want me to do
I promise you, you'll be screaming out at home when I'm through

It's just the set
Choice in these steps
Lets take it somewhere we haven't been yet
Its gonna be kinda hard cus' I can't always bring you
The crowd is screaming out I want more I hear you

How is your seat
Can you see everything?
Baby I don't want you'miss anything
I'ma dedicate this next one to you cus' you my number one fan
and I'm showing you love

House lights go low
Spotlight up more
It's time so just sit back
And enjoy the show

Time to close the curtains
Come up on the stage and sing
Before the show starts Mic check
Tonight is so exclusive
We should make it Pay-Per-View

Time to close the curtains
I only take requests from you
Just tell me what you want me to do
I promise you, you'll be screaming out at home when I'm through

Now's the perfect time for an Intermission
If you need something to drink
Better get it by now (by now)
Gotta break it down (by now)
Cus' I don't want some, no more

Now I call You for the end of the show
Let me slow it down
I'm not ready to get off
As the finale's done I'll open the door

Time to close the curtains (To close the Curtains baby)
Come on in the stage is set (Stage is set)
Before the show starts Mic check (baby)
Tonight is so exclusive
We should make it Pay-Per-View

Time to close the curtains
I only take requests from you
Just tell me what you want me to do
I promise you, you'll be screaming out at home when I'm through
