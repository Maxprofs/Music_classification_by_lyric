                        Bài hát: I Lay My Love On You - Westlife

Just a smile and the rain is gone
Can hardly believe it, yeah
There's an angel standing next to me
Reaching for my heart

Just a smile and there's no way back
Can hardly believe it, yeah
But there's an angel calling me
Reaching for my heart

I know that I'll be okay now
This time, it's real

I lay my love on you
It's all I wanna do
Every time I breathe I feel brand new

You open up my heart
Show me all your love and walk right through
As I lay my love on you

I was lost in a lonely place
Could hardly believe it, yeah
Holding on to yesterday
Far, far too long

Now, I believe it's okay
'Cause this time it's real

I lay my love on you
It's all I wanna do
Every time I breathe I feel brand new

You open up my heart
Show me all your love and walk right through, oh yeah
As I lay my love on you

I never knew that love could fell so good

Like a once in a lifetime
You change my world

I lay my love on you
You make me feel brand new
Show me all your love and walk right through, oh yeah
As I lay my love on you

I lay my love on you
It's all I wanna do
Every time I breathe I feel brand new

You open up my heart
Show me all your love and walk right through
As I lay my love, I lay my love on you

I lay my love on you, oh
You make me feel brand new
You open up my heart
Show me all your love and walk right through
As I lay my love on you
As I lay my love on you
