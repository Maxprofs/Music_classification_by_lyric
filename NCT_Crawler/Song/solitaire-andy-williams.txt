                        There was a man,
 A lonely man
 Who lost his love
 Through his indifference.
 A heart that cares
 That went unshared
 And slowly dies
 Within his silence. Now Solitaire's the only game in town
 And every road that takes me takes me down,
 And by myself it's easy to pretend,
 I'll never love again.
 And keeping to myself I play the game,
 Without your love it always ends the same,
 While life goes all around me everywhere,
 I'm playing Solitaire. Another day, a lonely day,
 So much to say that goes unspoken.
 And through the night
 Each sleepless night
 The eyes are closed
 The heart is broken. Now Solitaire's the only game in town
 And every road that takes me takes me down,
 And by myself it's easy to pretend
 You're coming back again.
 And keeping to myself I play the game,
 Without your love it always ends the same,
 While life goes all around me everywhere,
 I'm playing Solitaire. Solitaire's the only game in town
 Every road that takes me takes me down ...
