                        Song: We Belong Together - Randy Newman

Don't you turn your back on me
Don't you walk away
Don't you tell me I don't care, cause I do
Don't you tell me I'm not the one
Don't you tell me I ain't no fun
Just tell me you love me like I love you, you know you do
When we're together, gray skies clear up
And I cheer, to where I'm less depressed
It's sincerer from the bottom of my heart
I just can't take it when we're apart
We belong together
We belong together
Yes we do
You'll be mine forever
We belong together
We belong together
Oh, it's true
It's gonna stay this way forever
Me and you
If I could really talk to you
If I could find a way
I'm not shy, there's a whole lot I wanna say
Of course there is
Talk about friendship and loyalty
Talk about how much you mean to me
And I promise to always be be your side
Whenever you need me
The day that I met you
Was the luckiest day of my life
And I bet you feel the same
At least, I hope you do!
So don't forget me
If the future should take you away
So that you'll always be
Part of me
We belong together
We belong together
Wait and see
S'gon be this way forever
We belong together
We belong together, honestly
We'll go on this way forever
Me and you
You and me
                        
                    |
