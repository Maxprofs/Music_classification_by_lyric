                        Don't hold your breath

 You can't touch me now
 There's no feeling left
 If you think I'm coming back
 Don't hold your breath
 What you did to me
 Boy I can't forget
 If you think I'm coming back
 Don't hold your breath

 I was under your spell for such a long time, 
 Couldn't break the chains
 You played with my heart, 
 Told me (...) with all your lies and games
 It took all the strength I had
 But I crawled up on my feet again
 Now you're trying to lure me back
 But no, those days are gone, my friend

 I loved you so much that I thought someday that you could change
 But all you brought me was a heart full of pain

 You can't touch me now
 There's no feeling left
 If you think I'm coming back, 
 Don't hold your breath
 What you did to me
 Boy I can't forget
 If you think I'm coming back, 
 Don't hold your breath
 Don't hold your breath

 I was worried about you
 But you never cared about me none
 You took my money
 And I know that you, you could kill someone
 I gave you everything
 But nothing was ever enough
 You were always jealous over such crazy stuff

 You can't touch me now
 There's no feeling left
 If you think I'm coming back, Don't hold your breath
 What you did to me
 Boy I can't forget
 If you think I'm coming back, 
 Don't hold your breath
 Don't hold your breath

 Move on, 
 Don't look back
 I jumped off a train
 Running off the tracks
 Your days gone, 
 Face the facts
 A bad movie ends
 And the screen fades to black

 What you did to me
 Boy I can't forget
 If you think I'm coming back
 (You can't touch me now)

 You can't touch me now
 There's no feeling left
 If you think I'm coming back, 
 Don't hold your breath
 What you did to me
 Boy I can't forget
 If you think I'm coming back, 
 Don't hold your breath

 You can't touch me now
 There's no feeling left
 If you think I'm coming back, 
 Don't hold your breath
 What you did to me
 Boy I can't forget
 If you think I'm coming back, 
 Don't hold your breath

 Oooh
