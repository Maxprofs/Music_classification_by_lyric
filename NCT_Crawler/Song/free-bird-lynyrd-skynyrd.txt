                        If I leave here tomorrow 
Would you still remember me? 
For I must be travelling on, now, 
'Cause there's too many places I've got to see. 
But, if I stayed here with you, girl, 
Things just couldn't be the same. 
'Cause I'm as free as a bird now, 
And this bird you can not change. 
Lord knows, I can't change.

Bye, bye, its been a sweet love. 
Though this feeling I can't change. 
But please don't take it badly, 
'Cause Lord knows I'm to blame. 
But, if I stayed here with you girl, 
Things just couldn't be the same. 
Cause I'm as free as a bird now, 
And this bird you'll never change. 
And this bird you can not change. 
Lord knows, I can't change. 
Lord help me, I can't change.
