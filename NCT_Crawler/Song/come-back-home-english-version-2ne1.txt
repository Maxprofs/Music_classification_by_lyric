                        Bài hát : Come Back Home (English Version) - 2NE1

One, two, three, you left me without a sign
But I can hear you breathing somewhere, I'm lost in my mind
Once again four, five, six, red tears are flowingfrom my eyes
I miss your smell I miss your touch I miss how we cried

You said "baby, this is better, turn around"
and you walked away and left me asking;
Why did you not stay? you not stay? You're gone away

Come back home
Can you come back home, eh
Don't leave me wasting all my time,
Don't leave me helpless in this cold world
Come back home
Can you come back home, eh
Let's put the pain we feel away,
'Cause I'm still waiting for you every day
Now you gotta do what you gotta do

COME BACK HOME
COME BACK HOME

Come baby baby come come baby
Come come baby baby come come (come back to me now)
Come baby baby come come baby
Come come baby baby come come

You never answer me, just try and give me a call
Do you still miss me? Do you think of me at all? Yeah
Now I am trapped in time without you, let me fall
I can't see you or what's in front of me, come home

All the days we have are waiting, let them be
like a way for us to find each other
It's the only way, only way, too far away

Come back home
Can you come back home, eh
Don't leave me wasting all my time,
Don't leave me helpless in this cold world
Come back home
Can you come back home, eh
Let's put the pain we feel away,
'Cause I'm still waiting for you everyday
Now you gotta do what you gotta do

COME BACK HOME
COME BACK HOME

Come baby baby come come baby
Come come baby baby come come (come back to me now)
Come baby baby come come baby
Come come baby baby come come

Come back home
Can you come back home, eh
Don't leave me wasting all my time,
Don't leave me helpless in this cold world
Come back home
Can you come back home, eh
Let's put the pain we feel away,
'Cause I'm still waiting for you everyday
Now you gotta do what you gotta do
                        
                    |
