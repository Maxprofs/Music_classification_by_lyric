                        Bài hát: Knock On My Door - Shakira

I'm gonna obey all your wishes as if
they were orders
I'm gonna dye your body in kisses
while we're growing older
I'll be there to beat your fears in all the
three hundred sixty five days a year

so this is what I say

Knock on my door
you know I'll be in town
come ask for more don't let me down
what is off what is on
what is left what is gone
I'm gonna give it all for you baby
you can consider it done

I'm gonna live all my mondays like the
sunniest sundays
I'm gonna go through life every moment
thinking of you always
and again we'll beat our fears there's
only three hundred sixty five days a
year

so this is what I say

Knock on my door
you know I'll be in town
come ask for more don't let me down
what is off what is on
what is left what is gone
I'm gonna give it all for you baby
you can consider it done

Knock on my door
Knock on my door

don't let me down
you know I'll be in town
                        
                    |
