                        Song: Hey Mama (Club Killers Remix) (Listeninâ€™ Continuous Album Mix) - David Guetta, Nicki Minaj, Bebe Rexha, Afrojack

Banging the drum like dum di di day
I know you want it in the worst way
I wanna hear you callin' my name
Like hey ma ma mama
hey ma ma mama

Yes I do the cooking
Yes I do the cleaning
Plus I keep ... for your eating
Yes you be the boss 
and yes I be respecting
Whatever that you tell me 
cause it's game you be spitting

Best believe that
when you need that
I'll provide that
you will always have it
I'll be on deck
keep it in check
When you need that
I'm a let you have it

Beating my drum like dum di di day
I like the dirty rhythm you play
I wanna hear you callin' my name
Like hey ma ma mama
hey ma ma mama

Banging the drum like dum di di day
I know you want it in the worst way
I wanna hear you callin' my name
Like hey ma ma mama
hey ma ma mama

Whole crew got the juice
Your dick came the truth
My screams is the proof
Them other dudes get the deuce
When I speed in the coupe
Leavin' this interview
It ain't nothing new
I been *** with you
None of them bitches ain't taking you
Just tell 'em to make a U
That's how it be
I come first like debut
So baby when you need that
Gimme the word I'm no good
I'll be bad for my baby
Make sure that he's getting his share
Make sure that his baby take care
Make sure I'm on my toes on my knees
Keep him pleased rub him down
Be a lady and a freak

Beating my drum like dum di di day
I like the dirty rhythm you play
I wanna hear you callin' my name
Like hey ma ma mama
hey ma ma mama
