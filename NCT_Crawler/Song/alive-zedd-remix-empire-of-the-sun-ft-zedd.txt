                        Bài hát: Alive - Empire Of The Sun, Zedd

Days go by my window
World slows down as it goes
Goodbye to last night
Lost love out of sight
Can’t you help me see?
(They won’t get right)

Loving every minute cause you make me feel so alive
Alive Loving every minute cause you make me feel so alive
Alive, alive, alive

Waking in the snow
Tracing steps with you
Swimming through the smoke
Wrapped in velvet coat
Can’t you help me see?
(They won’t get right)

Loving every minute cause you make me feel so alive,
alive Loving every minute cause you make me feel so alive, alive
Alive, alive, alive

Can you describe through me
All the world that you see?
I need someone, I’m just waiting on
Freedom is within you
Giving makes us feel good
Hello to our people
Say hello to the future
Freedom is within you
Giving makes us feel good
Hello to our ṗeople
Say hello to the future

Loving every minute cause you make me feel so alive,
alive Loving every minute cause you make me feel so alive, alive
Alive, alive, alive
Loving every minute cause you make me feel so alive
Alive Loving every minute cause you make me feel so alive
Alive, alive, alive
