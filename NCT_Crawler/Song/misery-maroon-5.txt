                        Bài hát: Misery - Maroon 5

Oh yeah
Oh yeah
So scared of breaking it
But you won't let it bend
And I wrote two hundred letters
I will never send
Sometimes these cuts are so much deeper than they seem
You'd rather cover up
I'd rather let them bleed
So let me be
And I'll set you free

[Chorus:]
I am in misery
There ain't nobody who can comfort me
(Oh yeah)
Why won't you answer me
The silence is slowly killing me
Girl you really got me bad
You really got me bad
I'm gonna get you back
Gonna get you back

Your salty skin and how
It mixes in with mine
The way it feels to be
Completely intertwined
Not that I didn't care
It's that I didn't know
It's not what I didn't feel,
It's what I didn't show
So let me be
And I'll set you free

I am in misery
There ain't nobody who can comfort me (Oh yeah)
Why won't you answer me
The silence is slowly killing me

Girl you really got me bad
You really got me bad
I'm gonna get you back
I'm gonna get you back

Say your faith is shaken
You may be mistaken
You keep me wide awake and
Waiting for the sun
I'm desperate and confused
So far away from you
I'm getting there
I don't care where I have to go

Why do you do what you do to me, yeah
Why won't you answer me, answer me, yeah
Why do you do what you do to me, yeah
Why won't you answer me, answer me, yeah

I am in misery
There ain't nobody who can comfort me (Oh yeah)
Why won't you answer me
The silence is slowly killing me (Oh yeah)

[x3]
Girl you really got me bad
You really got me bad
I'm gonna get you back
Gonna get you back
