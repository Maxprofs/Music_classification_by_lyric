                        I'm so tired of feeling so alone 
So scared I'm sick inside I long to see my home 
On yellow river

So long boy, you can take my place
Got my papers got my pay
So pack my bags and I'll be on my way
To yellow river

Put my gun down the war is won
Fill my glass high the time has come
I'm going back to the place that I love
Yellow river

Chorus:
Yellow river, yellow river
Is in my mind and in my eyes
Yellow river, yellow river
Is in my blood, it's the place I love
Got no time for explanation got no time to lose
Tomorrow night you'll find me
Sleeping underneath the moon at yellow river

Cannon fire lingers in my mind
I'm so glad that I'm still alive
And I've been gone now for such a long time
From yellow river

I remember the nights were cool
I can still see the water pool
And I remember the girl that I knew
On yellow river

(Chorus)
                        
                    |
