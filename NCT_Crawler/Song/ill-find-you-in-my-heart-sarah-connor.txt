Hey Hmmmmmm

What ever happened to our lovescene
Somethin' that we may never know
The touch of your tender hands
That once curess your soul
But I never thought a day you have to go

I will always find you in my heart
No matter if we're near or if you're far
I just have to close my eyes
Just make a wish, I see you there
And all my dreams come true
(Whenever you're not right here by my side)
Then I know forever you'll be mine
No matter if you're close or far
I'll find you in my heart

Walking alone I hear your footsteps
Lyin' alone and feel your breath, uuhh
(Lyin' alone I feel your breath)
Wish I could turn back time
When love was also mood
And I realize I miss the times with you

I will always find you in my heart
No matter if you're near or if you're far
I just have to close my eyes
Just make a wish, I see you there
And all my dreams come true

(Background)
Then I know forever we'll be mine
No matter if you're close or far
I'll find you in my heart

I'm not gonna let the pain displace be
I'll do everything I've got to do to
hold you near and find you in my heart
I never believed that friends and lovers
simply walk away
So I ask of you (ask of you)
If the love was true (love was true)
Why couldn't you just stay (couldn't you stay)
Yeahyyeah

I will always find you in my heart
No matter if you're near or if you're far
I just have to close my eyes
Just make a wish, I see you there
And all my dreams come true
(And all my dreams come true)
Then I know forever you'll be mine
No matter if we're close or far
I'll find you in my heart

Baby, baby, baby I know
I will always, I will always find you in my heart
I just have to close my eyes
Make a wish, I see you there
And all my dreams come true
I will always, I will always find you in my heart
No matter if you're near or if you're far
I'll find you in my heart
No matter if you're near or if you're far
I'll find you in my heart.
