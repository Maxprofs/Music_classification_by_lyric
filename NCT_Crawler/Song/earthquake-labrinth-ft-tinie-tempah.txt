 Labrinth come in...
 Labrinth come in...
 Ladies and gentleman
 This is something they call
 A ground-breaker, (breaker...)
 So let me first apologize
 To the shirts and the ties
 For your make up
 Cause I make you ugly
 As soon as it drops
 We're on a rampage
 Bottles poppin' off
 Before you know it
 There's rubble and dust
 Cuz we be f***ing it up
 Somebody say
 (You better run)
 Yeah!
 I predict an earthquake up in here
 say yeah!
 I predict an earthquake up in here
 Cause we throw bombs on it, throw bombs on it
 Just smash something, yeah mosh for me
 yeah!
 I can make an earthquake up in here
 Ladies and gentleman
 What you're about to witness
 Is no illusion
 And now, we got the bass banging from here to Buckingham Palace
 They're all moving
 Hey Simon, we're f***ing them up
 Turning them Syco
 Everybody rock
 Let's bring the house down to rubble and dust
 Cuz we be f***ing it up
 Somebody say
 You better run
 Yeah!
 I predict an earthquake up in here
 Say yeah!
 I predict an earthquake up in here
 Cause we throw bombs on it, throw bombs on it
 Just smash something, yeah mosh for me
 yeah!
 I can make an earthquake up in here
 (Say yeah!
 I predict an earthquake up in here
 Say Yeah
 I can make an earthquake up in here
 Cause we throw bombs on it, throw bombs on it
 Say Yeah!)
 So Here We Go We Go,
 [Tinie Tempah]
 Hey yo, Labrinth,
 This ones feeling like a straight 10 on the Richter scale you know,
 Yeah!
 Fire, fire,
 We about to set this place on fire
 Without a match or lighter
 Don't do girlfriends
 One nighters, make 'em (ahh)
 C-minor, if I want Christian
 Or Kurt Gieger, I just phone up the designer
 Doing all nighters
 No days off, grey hairs and a little weight loss
 I Predict (Riots)
 I Predict (Chaos)
 I Predict (people)
 I Predict (aahh)
 Disturbing london, got the whole city panicking
 I be nostradamus my n-n-n*ggah
 Labrinth

 I predict an earthquake up in here
 Say yeah!
 I predict an earthquake up in here
 Cause we throw bombs on it, throw bombs on it
 Just smash something, yeah mosh for me
