                        Bài hát: Ain't That Why - R3hab, Krewella

[Verse 1: Krewella]
These hearts are cold, it's hard, no joke
We go for broke (lips touch face up)
You say it yourself, I'm Heaven, I'm Hell
You crack my shell (take that case off)

[Pre-Chorus 1: Krewella]
Favorite room at the Roosevelt
Head is spinning like carousel
Strip tease and tequila, mad love is a healer
'Til I knock you off your pedestal
Blame the *** on the chemicals
'Cause I always speak my feelings, I mean it

[Chorus: Krewella]
Ain't that why you love me?
Ain't that why you still come back for more?
Ain't that why you love me?
Maybe I'm the truth you're looking for
Ain't that why you, ain't that why you
Ain't that why you, ain't that why you love me?
Ain't that why? Ain't that why?
Ain't that why? Ain't that why you love me?

[Verse 2: Krewella]
We're North, we're South, I run my mouth
You have your doubts (I don't blame ya)
I'm weak, I'm tough, *** up, make up
Then words get rough (that's my nature)

[Pre-Chorus 2: Krewella]
I stay unpredictable, borderline too cynical
You balance out that crazy, the sober to my faded
So I put on you on that pedestal, all on fire like chemical
But I always speak my feelings, I mean it

[Chorus: Krewella]
Ain't that why you love me?
Ain't that why you still come back for more?
Ain't that why you love me?
Maybe I'm the truth you're looking for
Ain't that why you, ain't that why you
Ain't that why you, ain't that why you love me?
Ain't that why? Ain't that why?
Ain't that why? Ain't that why you love me?
Ain't that why? Ain't that why?
Ain't that why? Ain't that why you love me?
