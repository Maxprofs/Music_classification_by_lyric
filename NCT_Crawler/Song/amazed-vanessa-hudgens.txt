                        "Amazed"
(feat. Lil Mama)

When I'm all broke down
Heading for disaster
And I'm spinning round
Trying to find a clue
And my head is tired
Searching for the answer
Can't figure out
How I'm gonna get through the next 10 minutes

[Chorus:]
Baby I'm amazed what I feel for you
Baby I'm amazed what your faith can do
Baby I'm amazed where you take me to
Don't you know, oh
Baby I'm amazed what I feel for you
Baby I'm amazed what your faith can do
Baby I'm amazed where you take me to
Don't you know, oh

Oh, get, oh
Oh, oh
Oh, Get, oh
Oh, oh
Oh, get, oh
Oh, oh
Oh, Get, oh
Oh, oh

When I'm all burnt down
Need a place to run to
No one hears me shout
Lost and all alone
And I'm losing ground
No one understands me
Can't figure out
What I'm gonna do cause I just can't take it

[Chorus]

Oh, get, oh
Oh, oh
Oh, Get, oh
Oh, oh
Oh, get, oh
Oh, oh
Oh, Get, oh
Oh, oh

[Lil Mama:]
Yea, Lil Mama
Lets go
It's hard to figure you out
Ask you could you stay a while
Even if you gotta go
Chase your dough that's for sure
It's my love you're raising
But my heart you're praising
Passion
If you staying, ain't that amazing?
They be calling it a phase
We gonna kick phasing
Some don't wanna play the game
So they keep acing
That's a loser
You see me? I'm gonna keep chasing
This so, oh

[Vanessa:]
Baby I'm amazed what I feel for you
Baby I'm amazed what your faith can do
Baby I'm amazed where you take me to
Don't you know, oh
Baby I'm amazed what I feel for you (what I feel for you)
Baby I'm amazed what your faith can do (what your faith can do)
Baby I'm amazed where you take me to
Don't you know, oh

Oh, get, oh
Oh, oh
Oh, Get, oh
Oh, oh
Oh, get, oh
Oh, oh
Oh, Get, oh
Oh, oh
