                        Bài hát: Arrived - Jessi

[Hook 1]
Tell em I've arrived yea
See them holding up the sign yeah
Took forever and a day
They still comin at me side ways
I ain't never known a feeling, this good
Don't give me a reason
Bitch i wish you would

[Verse 1]
Being bad never looked or felt better uh
Ya girls a rebel never been the type to settle uh
I ain't playin games only tryna level up
I'm here to regulate, never be regular
It's only the beginning so you better slow your roll
Addicted to chanel I'm in love wit the coco
Every rose has a thorn bitch i'm rose gold
Thought i'd be a no show, But i pulled up

[Hook 2]
Tell em I arrived yea
Tell the valet bring my ride yea
Feeling so alive yea
But the doors are suicide yea
Tell em I've arrived yea
See them holding up the sign yeah
Took forever and a day
They still comin at me side ways
I ain't never known a feeling, this good
Don't give me a reason
Bitch i wish you would

[Verse 2]
They want me to fail
Just got a check in the mail
Young girl checkin the males
Gimmie a second i'm feelin myself
God damn i'm feelin myself
I derseve a day off
Don't forget to smell the flowers in the chaos
Countin down on all days I waited patiently
And all these years I never let my haters get to me
Hol up
Don't question me
My destiny
I manifested
Count my blessings
Hold me down you can count on jessi

[Pre hook]
(Don't let em' blind you)
Its hard to see who's fake or real
(Let me remind you)
I'm here to stay I came to kill
Now who the *** gon gonna take it from me
I'm finally happy, i'm makin money
So when i pull up

[Hook 1]
Tell em I've arrived yea
See them holding up the sign yeah
Took forever and a day
They still comin at me side ways
I ain't never known a feeling, this good
Don't give me a reason
Bitch i wish you would

[Bridge]
This journey is a lonely road
But when i look at who i do it for (for you)
It's the beginning of this roller coaster
Ain't no sign of slowing anytime soon
It's worth while It's worth while
To put a smile upon ur face
Brighten up your day
Hope you shine in every way
So when you walk into that crowded room
Its all eyes on you
So live your life loud and

[Hook 1]
Tell em I've arrived yea
See them holding up the sign yeah
Took forever and a day
They still comin at me side ways
I ain't never known a feeling, this good
Don't give me a reason
Bitch i wish you would (x5)
