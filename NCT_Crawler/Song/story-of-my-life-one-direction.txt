                        Bài hát: Story Of My Life - One Direction 

Harry: 
Written in these walls are the stories that I can't explain 
I leave my heart open but it stays right here empty for days 

Liam: 
She told me in the morning she don't feel the same about us in her bones 
It seems to me that when I die these words will be written on my stone 

Zayn: 
And I'll be gone gone tonight 
The ground beneath my feet is open wide 
The way that I been holdin' on too tight 
with nothing in between... 

Harry and all: 
The story of my life I take her home 
I drive all night to keep her warm and time...is frozen 
(the story of, the story of) 
The story of my life I give her hope 
I spend her love until she's broke inside 
The story of my life 
(the story of, the story of) 

Niall: 
Written on these walls are the colors that I can't change 
Leave my heart open but it stays right here in its cage 

Liam: 
I know that in the morning now I'll see us in the light upon your fears 
Although I am broken my heart is untamed still 

Louis: 
And I'll be gone gone tonight 
The fire beneath my feet is burning bright 
The way that I been holdin' on so tight 
with nothing in between 

Harry and all: 
The story of my life I take her home 
I drive all night to keep her warm and time...is frozen 
(the story of, the story of) 
The story of my life I give her hope 
I spend her love until she's broke inside 
The story of my life 
(the story of, the story of) 

Zayn: 
And I been waiting for this time to come around 
But baby running after you is like chasing the clouds 

Niall: 
The story of my life I take her home 
I drive all night to keep her warm and time...is frozen 

Harry and all: 
The story of my life I give her hope (give her hope) 
I spend her love until she's broke inside (until she's broke inside) 
The story of my life (the story of, the story of) 
The story of my life 
The story of my life (the story of, the story of) 
The story of my life...
