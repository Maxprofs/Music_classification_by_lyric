                        There's a light in the sky that hangs on the edge of illusion
 something very fine but it's something you know is there
 mystery of time hidden by a man of confusion
 but the hand is quicker than the eye
 only the stranger knows why
 'cos it's magic
 you know it's magic that you'll find
 you see it's magic
 I know who you are and there's magic in you
 keep your eye on the man
 and don't look away for a moment
 how is it done how does he make me see
 something up his sleeve when speaks you want to believe him
 but the hand is quicker than the eye
 only the stranger knows why
 'cos it's magic
 can' you see it's magic that you'll find
 you know it's magic
 I know who you are and there's magic in you
 driven by a force
 moving in another dimension
 here for today, gone for eternity
 seeking for truth hidden by the word of his wisdom
 but the hand is quicker than the eye
 only the stranger knows why
 can't you feel it's magic
 you know it's magic that you'll find
 I said it's magic
 I know who you are and there's magic in you
                        
                    |
