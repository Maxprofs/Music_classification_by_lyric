                        Bài hát: Please Don't Go Away (Chỉ Có Em Trong Tim) - V.A

It took a while
To live without you in my mind
It took some time
To get your smile out of my mind

Please tell my why?
Why did you let our love go by?
Please let me know
How can I go on all alone

You went away left me in the rain
Left me with my heart in pain
I don't wanna be here on my own

Please don't go away
Won't you stay, won't you want me someday
Please don't go away
Won't you say?
You never go away

Each time when I try to close my eyes
Each time when I hear those sad goodbyes
I can feel my heart go breaking deep inside

It took a while
To live without you in my mind
It took some time
To get your smile out of my mind

Please tell my why?
Why did you let our love go by?
Please let me know
How can I go on all alone

You went away left me in the rain
Left me with my heart in pain
I don't wanna be here on my own

Please don't go away
Won't you stay, won't you want me someday
Please don't go away
Won't you say? You never go away

Each time when I try to close my eyes
Each time when I hear those sad goodbyes
I can feel my heart go breaking deep inside

Each time when I try to close my eyes
Each time when I hear those sad goodbyes
I can feel my heart go breaking deep inside

Please don't go away
Won't you stay, won't you want me someday
Please don't go away
Won't you say?
You never go away

Each time when I try to close my eyes
Each time when I hear those sad goodbyes
I can feel my heart go breaking deep inside
                        
                    |
