                        I've heard there was a sacred chord 
That David played, and it pleased the Lord.
But you don't really care for music, do you?
It goes like this: The fourth, the fifth
The minor fall, the major lift.
The baffled king composing "Hallelujah"
Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah

Your faith was strong, you needed proof,
You saw her bathing on the roof.
Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew you.
She tied you to the kitchen chair,
She broke your throne, she cut your hair
And from your lips she drew the Hallelujah.
Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah

Well, maybe there's a God above,
And all I ever learned from love,
Was how to shoot at someone who outdrew you.
It's not a cry you can hear at night,
It's not somebody who's seen the light,
It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah.
Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah

Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah

Maybe I've been here before, 
I know this room, I've walked this floor.
I used to live alone before I knew you.
I've seen your flag on the marble arch.
Love is not a victory march.
It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah.
Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah

There was a time you let me know
What's really going on below,
But now you never show it to me, do you?
I remember when I moved in you,
Your holy dark was moving, too.
And every breath we drew was Hallelujah. 
Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah Hallelujah
                        
                    |
