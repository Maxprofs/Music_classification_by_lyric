                        So long to all of my friends, 
Everyone of them met tragic ends, 
With every passing day, 
I’d be lying if I didn’t say, 
That I miss them all tonight... 
And if they only knew what I would say, 
If I could be with you tonight... 
I would sing you to sleep, 
Never let them take the light behind your eyes... 
One day, I’ll lose this fight... 

As we fade in the dark, just remember you will always burn as 
Bright 

Be strong, and hold my hand. 
Time becomes for us, you’ll understand. 
We’ll say goodbye today, 
And we’re sorry how it all ends this way... 
If you promise not to cry, then I will tell you just 
What I would say 
If I could be with you tonight, 
I would sing you to sleep, 
Never let them take the light behind your eyes. 
I’ll fail and lose this fight, 
Never fade in the dark 
Just remember that you will always burn as bright. 
The light behind your eyes....the light behind your- 
Sometimes we must grow stronger and, 
You can’t be stronger in the dark. 
When I’m here, no longer, you must be stronger 
And if I could be with you tonight, 
I would sing you to sleep, 
Never let them take the light behind your eyes. 
I failed and lost this fight, 
Never fade in the dark, 
Just remember you will always burn as bright. 

The light behind your eyes...the light behind your eyes...the light behind 
Your eyes...the light behind your eyes... 

The light behind your eyes...the light behind your eyes...the light behind 
Your eyes...the light behind your....the light behind your eyes... 

The light behind...
                        
                    |
