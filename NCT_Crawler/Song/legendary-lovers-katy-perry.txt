                        Bài hát : Legendary Lovers - Katy Perry

Under a silver moon, tropical temperature
I feel my load is blue, come closer
I want your energy, I want your aura
You are my destiny, my mantra

Never knew I could see something so clearly looking through my third eye
Never knew karma could be so rewarding and bring me to your life
Maybe this is the beginning of something so magical, tonight (oh, oh)

Take me down to the river
Underneath the blood on sun
Say my name like a scripture
Keep my heart beating like a drum

Legendary lovers, we could be legendary
Legendary lovers, we should be legendary

Go down in history
Go down together, into infinity, forever
You clear your path to right
You blushing to the end
Anything for your love, a ride or die

Never knew I could see something so clearly looking through my third eye
Never knew karma could be so rewarding and bring me to your life
Maybe this is the beginning of something so magical, tonight (oh, oh)

Take me down to the river
Underneath the blood on sun
Say my name like a scripture
Keep my heart beating like a drum

Legendary lovers, we could be legendary
Legendary lovers, we should be legendary

[Instrume ntal]

Take me down to the river
Underneath the blood on sun
Say my name like a scripture
Keep my heart beating like a drum

Legendary lovers, we could be legendary
Legendary lovers, we should be legendary

Take me down to the river
Underneath the blood on sun
Say my name like a scripture
Keep my heart beating like a drum

Legendary lovers, we could be legendary
Legendary lovers, we should be legendary
                        
                    |
