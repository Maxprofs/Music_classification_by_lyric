                        Cats are cryin', gates are slammin'
 The wind is howlin' 'round the house tonight
 I'm as lonely as a boat out on the sea
 When the night is black and the tide is high
 Oh, on nights like these, feel like fallin' to my knees
 Feel like callin' heaven please Find my love
 Find my love
 Find my love
 Find my love Well I turn the dial on my radio trying to find an all night station
 I want to hear a song I know, song about my situation
 Oh oh, on nights like these, feel like fallin' to my knees
 Feel like callin' heaven please Find my love
 Find my love
 Find my love
 Find my love Somewhere out there there must be a boy for this girl
 Could be anywhere, could be next door or the other side of the world
 Call up my radio, give them my number
 Tell them to put it out on the air There must be someone
 There must be someone like me
 Sittin' lonely as a boat out there
 Oh oh, on nights like these, feel like fallin' to my knees
 Feel like calling heaven please Find my love
 Find my love
 Find my love
 Find my love Oh, find my love
 Find my love
 Find my love Oh, find my love
 Find my love
 Find my love
 Find my love
 Find my love
 Find my love Find my love
 Find my love
 Find my love
 Find my love Do I have to find my love?
 Find my love
 Find my love
 Find my love
