                        I can still remember the time 
You were there when I needed to hold you, feel you 
Everytime I ask you to find a new way 
You lie a new way, is it gone, gone, gone, gone, gone 

You said you'd change, but I'm afraid 
It's something I won't live to see 
It's seems so strange that sometimes fate 
Can appear to be so real and yet turn out to be a fantasy 

** Same old line, one more time 
Say you're gonna be, there for me 
Say you'll change, change your ways 
Never gonna keep your promises 
Same old game (you know it doesn't turn me on) 
Brand new day (you're singing that same old song) 
No more lies (if you don't wanna find me gone, gone, gone, gone, gone) 

*** Another night, another day, what can I say (what can I say) 
You're still the same old brand new you 
You break your promises in two, what can I do (what can I do) 
When you're the same old brand new you 

Because of you, I guess we're through 
Is this the way it has to be 
I've been a fool (I've been a fool) 
A fool for you (a fool for you) 
But I've got better things to do than let you walk all over me
