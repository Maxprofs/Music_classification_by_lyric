                        [Intro:]
 Yeah
 I know sometimes things may not always make sense to you right now
 But hey, what'd daddy always tell you?
 Straighten up little soldier
 Stiffen up that upper lip
 Whatchu crying about?
 You got me.

 [Verse:]
 Hailie, I know you miss your mom
 And I know you miss your dad when I'm gone
 But I'm tryin' to give you the life that I never had
 I can see your sad
 Even when you smile
 Even when you laugh
 I can see it in your eyes
 Deep inside you wanna cry
 Cuz you're scared
 I ain't there,
 Daddy's with you in your prayers
 No more cryin'
 Wipe them tears
 Daddy's here
 No more nightmares
 We gonna pull together through it
 We gon' do it
 Lainie's uncle's crazy ain't he, yeah
 But he loves you girl and you better know it
 We're all we got in this world
 When it spins
 When it swirls
 When it whirls
 When it twirls
 Two little beautiful girls
 Lookin' puzzled, in a daze
 I know it's confusing you
 Daddy's always on the move
 Mama's always on the news
 I try to keep you sheltered from it
 But somehow it seems, the harder that I try to do that
 The more it backfires on me
 All the things, growin' up
 As daddy, daddy had to see
 Daddy don't want you to see
 But you see just as much as he did
 We did not plan it to be this way,
 Your mother and me
 But things have got so bad between us
 I don't see us ever being
 Together ever again
 Like we used to be like when we was teenagers
 But then of course
 Everything always happen for a reason
 I guess it was never meant to be
 But it's just something
 We have no control over
 And that's what destiny is
 But no more worries
 Rest your head and go to sleep
 Maybe one day we'll wake up
 And this will all just be a dream

 [Chorus:]
 Now hush little baby don't you cry
 Every thing's gonna be all right
 Stiffin' that upper lip up little lady I told ya
 Daddy's here to hold ya through the night
 I know mommy's not here right now and we don't know why
 We fear how we feel inside, it may seem a little crazy
 Pretty baby but I promise, Mama's gon' be alright

 [Verse two]
 It's funny,
 I remember back one year when daddy had no money
 Mommy wrapped the Christmas presents up
 And stuck 'em under the tree
 And said some of 'em were from me,
 Cuz daddy couldn't buy 'em
 I'll never forget that Christmas
 I sat up the whole night crying
 Cuz daddy felt like a bum,
 See daddy had a job, but his job
 Was to keep the food on the table for you and mom
 And at the time every house that we lived in
 Either kept getting broken into and robbed or shot up on the block
 And your mom, was saving money for you in a jar
 Tryna to start a piggy bank for you
 So you could go to college
 Almost had a thousand dollars
 'Till someone broke in and stole it
 And I know it hurt so bad it broke your mamma's heart
 And it seemed like everything was just starting to fall apart
 Mom and dad was arguing a lot
 So mama moved back on to Chalmers in a flat
 One bedroom apartment
 And dad moved back to the other side of 8 mile on Novara
 And that's when daddy went to California with his cd
 And met Dr. Dre and flew you and Mama out to see me,
 But daddy had to work, you and mama had to leave me,
 Then you started seeing daddy on the tv
 And mama didn't like it
 And you and Lainnie were too young to understand it
 Papa was a rollin' stone, mama developed a habit
 And it all happened too fast for either one of us to grab it
 I'm just sorry you were there and had to witness it firsthand
 Cuz all I ever wanted to do was just make you proud
 Now I'm sittin' in this empty house,
 Just reminiscing. Looking at your baby pictures it just tricks me out
 To see how much you both have grown it's almost like you're sisters now
 Wow, guess you pretty much are and daddy's still here
 Lainnie I'm talking to you too daddy's still here
 I like the sound of that, yeah
 It's got a ring to it don't it
 Shhh, mama's only gone for the moment

 [Chorus:]
 Now hush little baby don't you cry
 Every thing's gonna be all right
 Stiffin' that upper lip up little lady I told ya
 Daddy's here to hold ya through the night
 I know mommy's not here right now and we don't know why
 We fear how we feel inside, it may seem a little crazy
 Pretty baby but I promise, mama's gon' be alright

 [End chorus]
 And if you ask me to, daddy's gonna buy you a mocking bird
 I'ma give you the world, I'ma buy a diamond ring for you,
 I'ma sing for you, I'll do anything for you to see you smile
 And if that mockingbird don't sing and that ring don't shine
 I'ma break that birdie's neck, I'll go back to the jeweler
 Who sold it to ya
 And make him eat every carat
 Don't *** with Dad (ha ha)
