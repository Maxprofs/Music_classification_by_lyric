                        Bài hát: Boss - Lay (EXO)

You gotta trust me
Nothing ever bust me
Pretty girls wanna get with me
Dudes wanna hush me
Hey baby
I got the rhythm new flow
Got a dozen of ’em I put it on show

They see me rolling wanna be like me
All you hear is rumble cause you can’t be me
I don’t deal with hypes just me alone
Oh ask me how I do it now

I’m the boss
The boss
I make you feel this vibe
I’m the boss
The boss
I’m your stereotype
I’m the boss
The boss
Cause all I do is thrive
I’m the boss
No stopping on a highway

The night is young
The beat is dropped now
Imma blow you up and high yeah
Can you hear the beat of your heart
Do you feel the tension ah

Be aware of caution
Acting like you are an option
I hit the turbulence you watch me make eruption
Hey baby
My heads up I don’t look back
I’m out here popping I’m always on track

They see me rolling wanna be like me
All you hear is rumble cause you can’t be me
I don’t need to try cause you already crave
That’s what I’m talking ’bout

I’m the boss
The boss
I make you feel this vibe
I’m the boss
The boss
I’m your stereotype
I’m the boss
The boss
Cause all I do is thrive alright
I’m the boss
No stopping on a highway

No one thought I would be the one to hold it down
I don’t need to compete with ya
When the reflection of moonlight is in my eyes
I will show you what I got yeah oh

I’m the boss
The boss
I make you feel this vibe
I’m the boss
The boss
I’m your stereotype
I’m the boss
The boss alright
Cause all I do is thrive
I’m the boss
No stopping on a highway

Think you think you know
But you but you really don’t
You’re not even near my level you gotta know I’m the boss

Think you think you know
But you but you really don’t
You’re not even near my level you gotta know I’m the boss
