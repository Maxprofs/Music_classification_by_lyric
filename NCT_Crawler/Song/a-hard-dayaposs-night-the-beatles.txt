                        IT'S BEEN A HARD DAY'S NIGHT
AND I'VE BEEN WORKING LIKE A DOG
IT'S BEEN A HARD DAY'S NIGHT
I SHOULD BE SLEEPING LIKE A LOG
BUT WHEN I GET HOME TO YOU
I'LL FIND THE THINGS THAT YOU DO
WILL MAKE ME FEEL ALRIGHT
YOU KNOW I WORK ALL DAY
TO GET YOU MONEY
TO BUY YOUR THINGS
AND IT'S WORTH IT JUST TO HEAR YOU SAY
YOU'RE GOING TO GIVE ME EVERYTHING
SO WHY ON EARTH SHOULD I MOAN, 'CAUSE WHEN I GET YOU ALONE
YOU KNOW I FEEL OK
WHEN I'M HOME
EVERYTHING SEEMS TO BE RIGHT
WHEN I'M HOME
FEELING YOU HOLDING ME TIGHT, TIGHT
OWWW!
IT'S BEEN A HARD DAY'S NIGHT
AND I'VE BEEN WORKING LIKE A DOG
IT'S BEEN A HARD DAY'S NIGHT
I SHOULD BE SLEEPING LIKE A LOG
BUT WHEN I GET HOME TO YOU
I'LL FIND THE THINGS THAT YOU DO
WILL MAKE ME FEEL ALRIGHT
SO WHY ON EARTH SHOULD I MOAN, 'CAUSE WHEN I GET YOU ALONE
YOU KNOW I FEEL OK
WHEN I'M HOME
EVERYTHING SEEMS TO BE RIGHT
WHEN I'M HOME
FEELING YOU HOLDING ME TIGHT, TIGHT, YEAH
IT'S BEEN A HARD DAY'S NIGHT,
AND I BEEN WORKING LIKE A DOG
IT'S BEEN A HARD DAY'S NIGHT,
I SHOULD BE SLEEPING LIKE A LOG
BUT WHEN I GET HOME TO YOU
I'LL FIND THE THINGS THAT YOU DO
WILL MAKE ME FEEL ALRIGHT
YOU KNOW I FEEL ALRIGHT
YOU KNOW I FEEL ALRIGHT
