Something Right
Westlife
By: Kevin Habbie

Never thought that I’d be so inspired
Never thought that I would find the higher truth
I believed that love was overrated
‘Till the moment I found you
Now baby I know I don’t deserve
The love you give me
But now I understand that

If you want me
I must be doing something right
I got nothing left to prove
And it’s all because of you
So if you need me
And baby I make you feel alive
I know I must be doing
Doing something right

It’s because of you I feel so lifted
I’ve been looking at my life
from higher ground
Never thought I’d be so elated
You’re the one that turned it all around

Now baby
I didn’t know myself
Until you changed me
And made me understand that

If you want me
I must be doing something right
I got nothing left to prove
And it’s all because of you
So if you need me
And baby I'll make you feel alive
I know I must be doing
Doing something right

Oohhh

And baby
I know I don’t deserve the love you give me
But I don’t really care, cause

If you want me
I must be doing something right
I got nothing left to prove
And it’s all because of you
So if you need me
And baby I'll make you feel alive
I know I must be doing
Doing something right

Doing something right
Yeah yeah
Something right

So if you need me
And baby I make you feel alive
I know I must be doing
I know I must be doing something right
Yeah yeah

Something right
