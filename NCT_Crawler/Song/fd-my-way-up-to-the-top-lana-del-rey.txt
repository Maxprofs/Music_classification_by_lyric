                        Bài hát : F****d My Way Up To The Top - Lana Del Rey

Life is awesome, I confess
What I do, I do best
You got nothing, I got tested
And I'm best, yes
Lay me down tonight in my linen and curls
Lay me down tonight, Riviera girls

I *** my way up to the top
This is my show
I *** my way up to the top
Go, baby, go
This is my show
Go
This is my show

I'm a dragon, you're a ***
Don't even know what you're good for
Mimicking me is a *** bore to me
But babe
Lay me down tonight in my diamonds and pearls
Tell me songs at night about your favorite girl

I *** my way up to the top
This is my show
I *** my way up to the top
Go, baby, go
This is my show
Go
This is my show

Need you baby, like I breathe you, baby
Need you baby, more, more, more, more
Need you baby, like I breathe you, baby
Said I need you baby, more, more, more more

Lay me down tonight in my linen and curls
Lay me down tonight, I'm your favorite girl

I *** my way up to the top
This is my show
I *** my way up to the top
Go, baby, go
This is my show
Go
This is my show

Need you baby, like I breathe you, baby
Need you baby, more, more, more, more
Need you baby, like I breathe you, baby
Said I need you baby, more, more, more more
