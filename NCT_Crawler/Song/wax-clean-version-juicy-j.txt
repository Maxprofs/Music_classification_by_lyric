                        Bài hát: Wax (Clean Version) - Juicy J

 Let's get high, let's get stoned
 Take a hit of this and you won't make it home
 Take another hit now I'm in my zone
 I can't remember *** these drugs got me gone

 [Hook]
 I come up with a hit and put it on wax
 My homie high as ***, I put him on wax
 It's goin' down, like candle wax
 Homie, I get on that wax and I ain't coming back
 Wax, wax, put him on wax
 Wax, wax, put him on wax
 Homie, I get on that wax and I ain't coming back
 Wax, wax, put him on wax

 [Verse 1]
 Wasted like a white boy, you know I got the best grass
 Chillin' wit my snow bunny, kick back, blowin' hash
 Two, three hits put you on your ass
 Weed look like it got a diaper rash
 Loud pack in a plastic bag, smoke out in a gas mask
 Hippie bitch made a, apple bong, good weed, alcohol
 We party like we college kids, got more money than a powerball
 Bitch I live that fast life every day in jet speed
 Look up in the sky, is that a plane, no it's just me

 [Hook]
 I come up with a hit and put it on wax
 My homie high as ***, I put him on wax
 It's goin' down, like candle wax
 Homie, I get on that wax and I ain't coming back
 Wax, wax, put him on wax
 Wax, wax, put him on wax
 Homie, I get on that wax and I ain't coming back
 Wax, wax, put him on wax

 [Verse 2]
 Hey bitch what that ass like, blow me like a bag pipe
 Trippy *** get high as ***, I be on them bag pipes
 Plus I got my cash right, shining on them like a flash light
 In the projects wit a ratchet bitch, her house look like a crash sight
 Shawty pussy so wet, waterfall, TLC
 That wax got me turnt up, that *** just the THC
 (Fire) Gettin' paid (fire) Gettin' blazed
 In the new Bentley Truck and I'm whippin' it like a runaway slave

 [Hook]
 I come up with a hit and put it on wax
 My homie high as ***, I put him on wax
 It's goin' down, like candle wax
 Homie, I get on that wax and I ain't coming back
 Wax, wax, put him on wax
 Wax, wax, put him on wax
 Homie, I get on that wax and I ain't coming back
 Wax, wax, put him on wax

 [Bridge]
 Let's get high, let's get stoned
 Take a hit of this and you won't make it home
 Take another hit now I'm in my zone
 I can't remember *** these drugs got me gone

 Let's get high, let's get stoned
 Take a hit of this and you won't make it home
 Take another hit now I'm in my zone
 I can't remember *** these drugs got me gone
