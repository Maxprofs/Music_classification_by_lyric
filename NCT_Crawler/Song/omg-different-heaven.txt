                        Bài hát: OMG - Different Heaven

We are the champions my friend 
And we'll keep on fighting 'til the end 
We are the champions, we are the champions 
No time for losers 'cos we are the champions of the world. 

[Crazy Frog:]
Ding A Dang Dong We're The Champions 

[Rapper:]
Ding a dang dong let's rock that sound (ding ding) 
Everybody hear what's going down (*** ***) 
Ding a dang dong we've reached the top (ding ding) 
Time and again from the penalty spot (bom bom bom) 

Ding a dang dong in the stadium (ding-a-dang-dong ding-a-dang-dong) 
Cos it's a goal we have won (ding-a-dang-dong we're the champions) 

(Ding-ding-ding-ding-ding-ding-ding) 

[Chorus:]
We are the champions my friend 
And we'll keep on fighting 'til the end 
We are the champions, we are the champions 
No time for losers 'cos we are the champions of the world. 

(Ding-a-dang-dong we're the champions) 
C'mon 
(Ding-a-dang-dong we're the champions) 
Of the world
                        
                    |
