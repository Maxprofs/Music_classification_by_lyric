[al:Year Of The Dragon]
Behind the sun
I found some one
My china woman, oh no
She's painting clouds,day in day out
My china girl, don't go
Oh I can't oh I can't oh I can't ignore
The way she looks to me
Oh I can't oh I can't oh I can't give her more
Just my heart, she is my destiny
She has china in her eyes, can't you see it
China in her eyes, can't you feel it
China in her eyes, a secret smile
Oh can't you see, it's you and me
My china woman, oh no
I miss you so, can't let you go
My china girl, don't go
Behind brown eyes
She's mystify
My china woman, oh no
It's like a dream the moon turns green
My china girl, don't go
I believe I believe I believe I'll fly
I'm writing hearts to you
And I wait and I wait, see a rose in the sky
Take my heart, what have I got to do
She has china in her eyes, can't you see it
China in her eyes, can't you feel it
China in her eyes, a secret smile
Oh can't you see, it's you and me
My china woman, oh no
I miss you so, can't let you go
My china girl, don't go
She has china in her eyes, can't you see it
China in her eyes, can't you feel it
China in her eyes, a secret smile
Oh can't you see, it's you and me
My china woman, oh no
I miss you so, can't let you go
My china girl, don't go
