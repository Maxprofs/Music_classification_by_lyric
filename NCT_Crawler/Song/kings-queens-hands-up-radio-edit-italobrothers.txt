Waiting for the night to shine like a star
Everyone no matter where you are.
If you're near or far...
And this is what we need, what we will be
Clearing black for all the world to see
This is you and me
Ohhh, oh, oh, oh, oh!
Where the Kings and the Queens of the night?
Wohoo!
Where the Kings and the Queens of the night?
Wohohoo!
Where the Kings and the Queens of the night?
Ohhh, oh, oh, oh.
Wohohoo!
Where the Kings and the Queens of the night?
Wohohoo
Where the Kings and the Queens of the night?
Wohohoo
Where the Kings and the Queens of the night?
Long and for the ligth to fate from the sky
Everyone let's raise their hands up high
'Till the day we die
And this is what we like, is what we do.
All along is gonna get us through
This is me and you
Wohohoo
Where are the Kings and the Queens of the night?
Wohohoo
Where are the Kings and the Queens of the nigh?
Wohohoo
Where are the Kings and the Queens of the night?
Wohohoo
Where are the Kings and the Queens of the night?
The Kings and the Queens!
Wohooho
Where are the Kings and the Queens of the night?
Wohohoo
Where are the Kings and the Queens of the night?
