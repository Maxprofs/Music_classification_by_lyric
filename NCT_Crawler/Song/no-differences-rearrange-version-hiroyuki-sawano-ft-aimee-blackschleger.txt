                        Bài hát: No Differences (ReArrange Version) - Hiroyuki Sawano, Aimee Blackschleger

Got over it ages ago 
Where we were from the same river 
Thinking about how we lost our minds 
I don't care what's in the past 

They don't care about old trouble 
Many wars wherever you go 
Somebody please, can we stop all the fights? 
I'll do it because it's my turn 

Take a step back 
Please face up to reality yes 
You don't hear me no 
You can change that if you want 

But don't you know 
There are people crying everyday 
Let's fly away for earth and mars today 
Don't stop me now 

Look around the world 
How can we stop the war? 
Hello. But are we sure enough? 
You'll come back tomorrow but I need to know that 

Look around the world 
So what are we fighting for? 
Can I ask you, why the sky is blue? 
There's no difference you and me 

Take a step back 
Please face up to reality yes 
You don't hear me no 
You can change that if you want 

But don't you know 
There are people crying everyday 
Let's fly away for earth and mars today 
Don't stop me now 

Look around the world 
How can we stop the war? 
Hello. But are we sure enough? 
You'll come back tomorrow but I need to know that 

Look around the world 
So what are we fighting for? 
Can I ask you, why the sky is blue? 
There's no difference you and me 

Because it's time to wake you up 
Over there my friend now 
Come on take my hand 
Take it now see far away 

See the dawn, it's time to fly 
Over there my friend here we are 
Come on just share this perfect sky 
See the dawn 

Hold me now 
Catch my hopes 
Feel me now 
In your arms
                        
                    |
