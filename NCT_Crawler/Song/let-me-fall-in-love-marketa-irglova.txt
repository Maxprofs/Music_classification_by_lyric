                        Bài hát: Let Me Fall in Love - Marketa Irglova

Before I go to sleep tonight
Won't you tell a story?
One that does not center
Around power or glory

A simple tale of love
That is tender and sweet
However glorified still uncorrupted
With a steady heartbeat

Or better still of love
That's also passionate and wide
That holds the light of youth
And makes you playful like a child

And let me fall in love, fall in love
Let me fall in love, fall in love

I've heard people speak
Of sad endings and broken hearts
But the heart does heal
And where you thing ends another starts

I've hear them say they wish
They never knew such pain
But to wish for pain-free love
Is to wish in vain

And anyway pain does not have
To mean suffering
If love is a gift, to it yield an offering

'Cause when you in love, you fall in love
With everything, with everyone
And you look at the world through a new pair of eyes
And you see fear it crawls, but love it flies

So, fly away, fly away
Grow a pair of wings and soar up high
This bird it sings a lullaby
Close your eyes, now go asleep
And dream a dream of falling deep in love

This bird it sings a lullaby
Close your eyes, now go asleep
And dream a dream of falling deep in love

This bird it sings a lullaby
Close your eyes, now go asleep
And dream a dream of falling deep in love

Let me fall in love, fall in love
Let me fall in love, fall in love
Let me fall in love, fall in love
Let me fall in love, fall in love

Let me fall in love, fall in love
Let me fall in love, fall in love
Let me fall in love, fall in love
Let me fall in love, fall in love
