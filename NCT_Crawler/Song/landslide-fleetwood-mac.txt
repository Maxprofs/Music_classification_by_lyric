                        Landslide
Fleetwood Mac

I took my love, I took it down
I climbed a mountain and I turned around
And I saw my reflection in the snow covered hills
till the landslide brought me down

Oh, mirror in the sky!
What is love!
Can the child within my heart rises above
Can I sail thru the changing ocean tides
Can I handle the seasons of my life

Uh oh I don't know!

Well, I've been afraid of changing
cause I've built my life around you
but time makes you bolder
Children get older
I'm getting older too!

I've been afraid of changing
'cause I've built my life around you
but time makes you bolder
Children get older
I'm getting older too!

I'm getting older too!

So, take this love, take it down
Oh, you climb a mountain and you turn around
If you see my reflection in the snow covered hills
The landslide will bring it down!

And if you see my reflection in the snow covered hills
Maybe the landslide will bring it down

Well well well bring it down!
