                        What I want, you've got
And it might be hard to handle
But like the flame that burns the candle
The candle feeds the flame
What I've got is full stock 
of thoughts and dreams that scatter
You pull them all together
And how, I can't explain

Oh yeah
Well well, you, You make my dreams come true
Well well, you, You make my dreams come true

On a night when bad dreams become a screamer
When they're messin' with the dreamer
I can laugh it in the face
Twist and shout my way out
And wrap yourself around me
'Cause I ain't the way that you found me
And I'll never be the same

Oh yeah
Well, 'cause you, You make my dreams come true
Well well, you, You make my dreams come true

Oh yeah
Listen to this

I'm down on my daydream
Oh that sleepwalk should be over by now
I know 
well you, You make my dreams come true"

I am waiting for you, for you girl
You make my dreams come true
                        
                    |
