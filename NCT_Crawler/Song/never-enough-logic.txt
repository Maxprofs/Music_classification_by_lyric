                        When that liquor get po' up
 And that green get roll up
 When them sets get throwed up
 I'm like naw man, hol' up
 Yea we bout it, sho 'nuff
 Better hope they don't call my bluff
 Cause my mind is going crazy
 This *** is never enough When that liquor get po' up
 And that green get roll up
 When them sets get throwed up
 I'm like naw man, hol' up
 Yea we bout it, sho 'nuff
 Better hope they don't call my bluff
 Cause my mind is going crazy
 This *** is never enough Never enough, never enough, never enough
 This *** is never enough
 Never enough, never enough, never enough
 This *** is never enough Crush a bit, little bit
 Roll it up, take a hit
 At the party with my homies
 Walk up and they play my ***
 On the road, kick a song
 Didn't have to sell my soul
 Visionary in this bitch and domination is the goal
 Where you stay, every day
 Just got my crib in LA
 Never play, we been at it way before that IDJ
 Never seems to be enough when money is the motive, cuh
 Bitches on my dick, don't give a ***
 Y'all must not know what's up
 In the cut, we don't give a ***
 We just tryna cut
 Line em up, if they say they bout then we'll sign em up
 Rattpack, that's a fact
 Basic bitch can't *** with that
 Where you at
 That's what they be asking, I say on the map We are, the coolest mother***ers on the planet
 Drop that new *** just cause they demand it
 Living like we got it cause we get it
 Do it just to say we ***ing did it
 We are, the coolest mother***ers on the planet
 Drop that new *** just cause they demand it
 Living like we got it cause we get it
 Do it just to say we ***ing did it When that liquor get po' up
 And that green get roll up
 When them sets get throwed up
 I'm like naw man, hol' up
 Yea we bout it, sho 'nuff
 Better hope they don't call my bluff
 Cause my mind is going crazy
 This *** is never enough Never enough, never enough, never enough
 This *** is never enough
 Never enough, never enough, never enough
 This *** is never enough
