                        Bài hát: Oops - Little Mix, Charlie Puth 

[Chorus: Perrie] 
Oops my baby, you woke up in my bed 
Oops we broke up, we're better off as friends 
Now I accidentally need you, I don't know what to do 
Oops baby I love you[Verse 1: Jesy] 
It started with "what's up with you?" 
I messed around and got caught up with you 
Yeah, yeah, I don't know what to do 
I've got these feelings like it's nothing new 
Now I can't get enough of you[Pre-Chorus: Leigh-Anne & Little Mix] 
And when I think about the way you touch my body 
I don't know how long I can wait 
And when I think about the way you touch my body 
This could be my greatest mistake 
You've got me singing[Chorus: Little Mix] 
Oops my baby, you woke up in my bed 
Oops we broke up, we're better off as friends 
Now I accidentally need you, I don't know what to do 
Oops baby I love you[Verse 2: Charlie Puth] 
We had a good run 
We messed around and had some good fun 
Guess it turns out I lost a good one 
'Cause now I miss you every morning [?] 
Wish you next to me babyAnd when I think about the way you touch my body 
This could be my greatest mistake 
You've got me singing[Chorus: Little Mix & Charlie Puth] 
Oops my baby, you woke up in my bed 
Oops we broke up, we're better off as friends 
Now I accidentally need you, I don't know what to do 
Oops baby I love you[Pre-Bridge: Perrie] 
Now I accidentally know that you're in love with me too 
Oops baby I love you[Bridge] 
If it was up to me 
I'd take a time machine to the day I said goodbye 
So can we try again 
We're official, more than friends 
No, don't you tell me goodbye 
You've got me singing[Chorus: Little Mix & Charlie Puth] 
Oops my baby, you woke up in my bed 
Oops we broke up, we're better off as friends 
Now I accidentally need you, I don't know what to do 
Oops baby I love you[Ending: Jade] 
Now I accidentally know that you're in love with me too 
Oops baby I love you
