                        Remember we'd be up all night
Talking 'til the morning light, yeah
Like the way it used to be
Those simple days
Just you and me, mmmm

I think baby I know
What's on your mind
Cuz you look like you've
Got something to say

I may not say those words anymore
But maybe it just ain't my way

**Chorus:
You ask me do I love you but
Do you remember
Why I walked on water for you
Do you remember
My first steps on the moon
Have you ever wondered why
I gave three wishes to you
You asked the question
Do You Remember lyrics on 
http://music.***/song/English/257-Do-You-Remember~Aaron-Carter.html
But the answer lies
In you, in you
The answer lies in you

Remember we used to laugh and say
No one else could get in our way
And there were times
When you would cry
And came knocking
On my door
And I was there
To shelter your pain

I think baby you should
Get that off your mind
Make it seem like
A brighter day

I may not say those words anymore
But maybe I can make it my way

Chorus**

The answer girl
Lies within your heart
Take a look inside


Chorus**
