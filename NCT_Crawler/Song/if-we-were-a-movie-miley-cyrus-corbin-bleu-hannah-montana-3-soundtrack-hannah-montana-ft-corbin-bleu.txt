                        Uh oh

There you go again talking cinematic

Yeah you!

You're charming, got everybody star struck.

I know

How you always seem to go

For the obvious instead of me

But get a ticket and you'll see



If we were a movie

You'd be the right guy

And I'd be the best friend that you'd fall in love with

In the end we'd be laughing

Watching the sunset

Fades to black

Show the names

Play the happy song



Yeah, yeah, when you call me

I can hear it in your voice

Oh, sure, you wanna see me

And tell me all about her

La La, I'll be acting through my tears

Guess you'll never know That I'll sure win an oscar for this scene I'm in



If we were a movie

You'd be the right guy

And I'd be the best friend that you'd fall in love with

In the end we'd be laughing

Watching the sunset

Fades to black

Show the names

Play the happy song



Wish I could tell you there's a twist

Some kind of hero in disguise

And we're together, it's for real now playing

Wish I could tell you there's a kiss

Like something more than in my mind

I see it, could be amazing



If we were a movie

You'd be the right guy

And I'd be the best friend that you'd fall in love with

In the end we'd be laughing

Watching the sunset

Fades to black

Show the names

Play the happy song

If we were a movie

You'd be the right guy

And I'd be the best friend that you'd fall in love with

In the end we'd be laughing

Watching the sunset

Fades to black

Show the names

Play the happy song

If we were a movie

You'd be the right guy

And I'd be the best friend that you'd fall in love with

In the end we'd be laughing

Watching the sunset

Fades to black

Show the names

Play the happy song
