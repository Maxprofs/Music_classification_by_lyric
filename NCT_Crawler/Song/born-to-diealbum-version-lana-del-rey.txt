                        Feet don't fail me now
 Take me to the finish line
 Oh my heart it breaks every step that I take
 But I'm hoping at the gates
 They'll tell me that your mine

 Walking through the city streets
 Is it by mistake or design
 I feel so alone on a friday night
 Can you make it feel like home
 If I tell you you're mine

 It's like I told you honey

 Don't make me sad
 Don't make me cry
 Sometimes love is not enough
 And the road gets tough I don't know why

 Keep making me laugh
 Lets go get high
 The road is long we carry on
 Try to have fun in the meantime

 Come take a walk on the wild side
 Let me kiss you hard in the pouring rain
 You like your girls insane

 Choose your last words
 This is the last time
 Because you and I
 We were born to die

 Lost but now I am found
 I can see but once I was blind
 I was so confused as a little child
 Trying to take what I could get
 Scared that I couldn't find

 All the answers honey

 Don't make me sad
 Don't make me cry
 Sometimes love is not enough
 And the road gets tough I don't know why

 Keep making me laugh
 Lets go get high
 The road is long we carry on
 Try to have fun in the meantime

 Come take a walk on the wild side
 Let me kiss you hard in the pouring rain
 You like your girls insane

 Choose your last words
 This is the last time
 Because you and I
 We were born to die

 We were born to die
 We were born to die

 Come take a walk on the wild side
 Let me kiss you hard in the pouring rain
 You like your girls insane

 Don't make me sad
 Don't make me cry
 Sometimes love is not enough
 And the road gets tough I don't know why

 Keep making me laugh
 Lets go get high
 The road is long we carry on
 Try to have fun in the meantime

 Come take a walk on the wild side
 Let me kiss you hard in the pouring rain
 You like your girls insane

 Choose your last words
 This is the last time
 Because you and I
 We were born to die

 We were born to die...
