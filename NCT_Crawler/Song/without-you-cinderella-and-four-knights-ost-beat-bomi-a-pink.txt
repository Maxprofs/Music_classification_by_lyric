Yoon Bomi – Without You English Translation
Don’t come any closer
Don’t make me dream
Run far away
I’m always dreaming a sad dream
I’ve placed you in my reddened eyes
In my frozen heart
A strong wind blows
It hurts even to breathe
I can’t stop my love
How much more do I have to hurt
In order to hold you in my arms?
I will wait until always
The reason I live is only you
Without you
Without you
Without you
I can’t let you go
Without you
Without you
Without you
I will wait for you until always
You don’t even know
That the reason I breathe is you
The words I love you aren’t enough
My only love in the world
How much more do I have to hurt
In order to hold you in my arms?
I will wait until always
The reason I live is only you
Without you
Without you
Without you
I can’t let you go
Without you
Without you
Without you
I will wait for you until always
Without you
Without you
Without you
I can’t live without you
Without you
Without you
Without you
I will love you until always
