                        Little lady, you're my music
 You're my favorite song
 Little lady, like to play
 Through the night, on and on And I know how to go slowly
 To the bottom of your soul Gimme, gimme, gimme your lovin'
 Give me vibration and sweet inspiration
 Oh, gimme, gimme, gimme your lovin'
 Don't keep me waiting, forever Little lady, give me more
 Give me more of your love and magical healing
 So little lady, keep me warm
 In your arms tonight Little lady, you're my ocean
 Let my boat sail along
 Little lady, something tender
 Through my heavenly home Take your time, time for devotion
 Lay your body next to mine Gimme, gimme, gimme your lovin'
 Gimme vibration and sweet inspiration
 Oh, gimme, gimme, gimme your lovin'
 Don't keep me waiting, forever Little lady, give me more
 Give me more of your love and magical healing
 So little lady, keep me warm
 In your arms tonight Gimme, gimme, gimme your lovin'
 Gimme vibration and sweet inspiration
 Oh, gimme, gimme, gimme your lovin'
 Don't keep me waiting, forever Little lady, give me more
 Give me more of your love and magical healing
 So little lady, keep me warm
 In your arms tonight Gimme, gimme, gimme your lovin'
 Gimme vibration and sweet inspiration
 Oh, gimme, gimme, gimme your lovin'
 Don't keep me waiting
