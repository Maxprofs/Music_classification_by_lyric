                        Bài hát: Hologram - Sia

[Intro]
Oh, oh

[Verse 1]
Oh
Red handed love
There is smoke and fire
You are the greatest liar
I wish you'd disappear
Now i've seen enough
Of your dirty love

Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Yes, I have seen enough
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Of your dirty love

[Pre-Chorus]
Now I got you out, I just want you gone
I need to be alone
You're dirty magic, you broke in my heart
With your black heart

[Chorus x2]
Now the power's up, and you are thin air
What an illusion, I could have sworn that you were there
Smoke and mirrors
You are just a hollow man, hologram

[Verse 2]
And I fear you'll be back, inside all the cracks
No, I can't handle that
History's heartbreak, was in my mind
Now I no longer cry

I-i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i
I no longer cry
Cry, i-i-i-i-i-i-i-i
I'll no longer cry

[Pre-Chorus]
Now I got you out, I just want you gone
I need to be alone
You're dirty magic, you broke in my heart
With your black heart

[Chorus x2]
Now the power's up, and you are thin air
What an illusion, I could have sworn that you were there
Smoke and mirrors
You are just a hollow man, hologram

[Bridge]
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

[Chorus - Variation]
But now the power's up, and you are thin air
What an illusion, I could have sworn that you were there
Smoke and mirrors
You are just a hollow man, hologram

[Outro]
Da, da-da, da, da-da-da-da-da...
                        
                    |
