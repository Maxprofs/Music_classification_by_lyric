[00:-2.00]Daughtry - Get Me Through
[00:-1.00]

Cry out to all who care to know
(Care to know, care to know)
I've been hollow way to long
I know where I'm going wrong

There's nothing I can do,
I believe you can get me through
(It's you that I believe in)
Nothing else would do,
I believe you can get me through
(So can you start believing)

Get me through

Colorblind, I paint your blue sky gray
(Blue sky gray, blue sky gray)
But this time
You'll shed some light on me
Just before I fade away

There's nothing I can do,
I believe you can get me through
(It's you that I believe in)
Nothing else would do,
I believe you can get me through
(So can you start believing)

Get me through

All the chances that you've taken
Promises that I keep breaking down
Are writings on the wall
Can't make out all the letters
But I know it's getting better now
The writings on, the writings on the wall

Get me through

There's nothing I can do,
I believe you can get me through
(It's you that I believe in)
(Nothing else would do,
I believe you can get me through
(So can you start believing)
