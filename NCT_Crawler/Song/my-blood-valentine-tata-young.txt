                        Song: My Bloody Valentine - Tata Young

Love my love my
I still love my love my

My valentine running rings around me
Hanging by a thread but we're loosening, loosening
The sparks were flyin' not the type that we need
Bringing a fire that is burning me, burning me

I know
Nobody said that it'd be easy
My heart
That we could find a way ,make a way
But you don't
You don't prioritize me

How'm I s'posed to believe yours games will ever change, ever change

It's such a dirty mess imperfect at it's best
But it's my love, my love, my bloody valentine
Sometimes I wanna leave but then I watch you next to me
My love, my love, my bloody valentine
Maybe I should but still I just can't walk away
Try to convince me once again that I should stay
Through all the brokenness this bleeding heart must confess
I love my, love my bloody valentine

Love my, love my
I still love my, love my bloody valentine

I open doors but you close them on me
I'm compromising won't you show the same, help the change
You're phone is ringing it says shorty, so tell me
What's her name, how'd she get your number
Don't try to be playin' me
'Cause I'll know
Before you even say anything
But I hope
You wouldn't lie to me, don't lie to me
You know that we've been here before
Oh Don't patronize, don't feed me lines
Just change your ways, yeah make it right
                        
                    |
