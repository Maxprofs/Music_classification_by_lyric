                        Baby I know that what we got it may not look like much
 There's problems knocking at our door
 Sometimes it feels like these walls are closing in on us
 And we can't hold them anymore
 And we got troubles stacking up so high like building blocks
 Just a breath could knock them down
 So we hold the air inside our lungs and hope it's long enough
 To keep them from crashing to the ground But everything's going to be okay 'Cause I got you, whoa whoa
 I got you, whoa whoa
 When we got nothing left to lose
 Baby, you got me and I got you
 Ohhh, whoa, whoaa
 Ohhh, whoa, whoaa
 There's nothing in our way that can't be moved
 Baby you got me and I got you We'll stand together through the rain
 We'll take the blows, we'll feel the pain
 Even if it leaves us bruised
 You'll be the shelter in the storm
 I'll be the fire that keep you warm
 Anything to get us through But everything's going to be just fine 'Cause I got you, whoa whoa
 I got you, whoa whoa
 When we got nothing left to lose
 Baby, you got me and I got you
 Ohhh, whoa, whoaa
 Ohhh, whoa, whoaa
 There's nothing in our way that can't be moved
 Baby you got me and I got you It's not where we've been, it's where we're going to
 And I'm not alone as long as I got you, (I got you)
 I got you, whoa, whoa You'll be the shelter in the storm
 I'll be the fire that keep you warm 'Cause I got you, whoa whoa
 I got you, whoa whoa
 When we got nothing left to lose
 Baby, you got me and I got you
 Ohhh, whoaaa, whoaaaaa (I got you)
 Ohhh, whoaaa, whoaaaaa (I got you)
 There's nothing in our way that can't be moved
 Baby you got me and I got you
 There's nothing in our way that can't be moved
 Baby you got me and I got you
