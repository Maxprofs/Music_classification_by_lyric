[Intro]
I say hi, you say hi
We stay high
You look so pretty, yeah

[Chorus]
I'm sweatin' from head to toe
I'm wet through all my clothes
I'm fully charged, nipples are hard
Ready to go
I'm sweatin' from head to toe
I'm wet through all my clothes
I'm fully charged, nipples are hard
Ready to go

[Verse]
No, I don't, I don't have a type
Take a hit
Come on over tonight
Take a hit
You can follow my bloodstream
No, I don't have a type

[Pre-Chorus]
Live right now, peakin' on top
So wild now, I'm high as ***
Don't look down
My mind, you can relax
I know how to dial it back
Not this time

[Refrain]
I say hi, you say hi
We stay high
You look so pretty, yeah

[Chorus]
I'm sweatin' from head to toe
I'm wet through all my clothes
I'm fully charged, nipples are hard
Ready to go
I'm sweatin' from head to toe
I'm wet through all my clothes
I'm fully charged, nipples are hard
Ready to go

[Verse]
No, I don't, I don't have a type
Take a hit
Come on over tonight
Take a hit
You can follow my bloodstream
No, I don't have a type

[Pre-Chorus]
Live right now, peakin' on top
So wild now, I'm high as ***
Don't look down
My mind, you can relax
I know how to dial it back
Not this time

[Refrain]
I say hi, you say hi
We stay high
You look so pretty, yeah

[Chorus]
I'm sweatin' from head to toe
I'm wet through all my clothes
I'm fully charged, nipples are hard
Ready to go
I'm sweatin' from head to toe
I'm wet through all my clothes
I'm fully charged, nipples are hard
Ready to go

[Bridge]
You think I'm drunk now, but I am not
You're so pretty, come roll with me
I'm 'bout to get down, I'm high as ***
I'm no chemist, but it's good ***

[Chorus]
I'm sweatin' from head to toe (oh)
I'm wet through all my clothes
I'm fully charged, nipples are hard
Ready to go (oh, oh)
I'm sweatin' from head to toe
I'm wet through all my clothes (yeah)
I'm fully charged, nipples are hard
Ready to go

[Outro]
I say hi, you say hi
We stay high
You look so pretty, yeah
Got good ***, what is it?
No chemist, still want that magic, yeah
I say hi, you say hi
We stay high
You look so pretty, yeah
Got good ***, what is it?
No chemist, still want that magic, yeah
