                        Like a shot through my heart, such a fool boy
How you spin me down
Show me all the stars in your world boy
Circling around
But I can’t let go, cause I want you so
Baby Imma hold you tight
If you just say so I’ll be falling in your arms tonight

[Chorus]
Higher, flying, higher
Higher, flying, higher
Feels like I’m walking on air
Feels like I’m flying
Feels like I’m walking on air
Feels like I’m flying

Falling lights from the sky like a showdown
Lighting up the night
I’ll be your satellite, take my hand now
Till the end of time
But I can’t let go, cause I want you so
Baby I’ma hold you tight
If you just say so I’ll be falling in your arms tonight

[Chorus]
Higher, flying higher
Higher, flying higher
Feels like I’m walking on air
Feels like I’m flying
Feels like I’m walking on air
Feels like I’m flying

[Snoop Dogg]
Mind to mind, eye to eye
Talk it, walk it, in the sky
Yeah yeah, what a player
Cloud nine, in the air
Elevate that, celebrate that
This feels good to me
Love is peace, see to see
Heart to heart, you and me
What’s it gonna be?
What you wanna do?
I just got to find some time to spend ... with you
Tasty aroma, all upon ya
G is the word, free is the bird
Snooping down, snoop in town
Blasting off in the clouds

[Chorus]
Feels like I’m walking on air
Feels like I’m flying
Feels like I’m walking on air
Feels like I’m flying
                        
                    |
