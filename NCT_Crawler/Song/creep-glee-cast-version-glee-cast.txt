                        [Brody:]
When you were here before,
Couldn't look you in the eye,
You're just like an angel,
Your skin makes me cry.

[Rachel:]
Ohh,
You float like a feather,
In a beautiful world,
Oh, I wish I was special,
You're so very special.
Ohh..

[Both:]
But I'm a creep (I'm a creep),
I'm a weirdo (I'm a weirdo),
What the hell am I doing here (What the hell am I doing here),
I don't belong here.

[Rachel:]
Ohh..
I don't care if it hurts, mmm,
I wanna have control, oh oh,
And I want a perfect body,
I want a perfect soul.

[Both:]
I want you to notice,
When I'm not around,
You're so very special,
I wish I was special, ohh.

But I'm a creep,
I'm a weirdo,
What the hell am I doing here,
I don't belong here.

Ohh, ohh.
He's running out the door,
He's running out,
He's run, run, run, run, run.

Whatever makes you happy,
Whatever you want,
You're so very special,
I wish I was special.

But I'm a creep,
I'm a weirdo,
What the hell am I doing here,
I don't belong here, mm,
I don't belong here.
