                        Bài hát: Boys & Girls - Will.I.Am, Pia Mia

We get *** up way before the party
Turnt up, hotel lobby
Fast life like a Ducati
Spending money like I'm from Saudi
Bagging bitches with the bad bodies
See me cooling with the black barbies
I got brain cause she a smarty
And now I'm feeling like la-di-da-di

(Hey!) Wait a second, wait a minute
I don't think you're ready for it
(Hey!) Party like a pro, baby, I don't gotta train for it
(Oooh) Drinking all the liquor, and I ain't even paying for it
(Woah) Any second, any minute, we about to sing the chorus

The girls wanna play with boys
And the boys wanna play with girls
And the girls wanna play with girls
Boys wanna play with boys
So boy, don't you love this world?
The girls wanna play with boys
And the boys wanna play with girls
And the girls wanna play with girls
Boys wanna play with boys
So boy, don't you love this world?

Oh-oh oh, oh-oh, oh-oh oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh oh, oh-oh, oh-oh oh
Oh-oh oh, oh-oh, oh-oh oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh oh, oh-oh, (hey!)

Baby, we don't stop, and we don't quit
In the club like we the ***
Too motherfucking legit
Up, up in it and we so lit
Up in this bitch, and we so lit
Oh my God, oh my goodness
Feel good, cause I'm sipping on good ***
Two drinks, got two fists
Three chicks, got two, four, six tits

(Hey!) Wait a second, wait a minute
Take you to the next level
(Hey!) Turn up the base, turn up the tre-treble
(Oooh) Party like an animal, party like a re-rebel
(Woah) Any second, any minute, we about to get in trouble

The girls wanna play with boys
And the boys wanna play with girls
And the girls wanna play with girls
Boys wanna play with boys
So boy, don't you love this world?
The girls wanna play with boys
And the boys wanna play with girls
And the girls wanna play with girls
Boys wanna play with boys
So boy, don't you love this world?

Oh-oh oh, oh-oh, oh-oh oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh oh, oh-oh, oh-oh oh
Oh-oh oh, oh-oh, oh-oh oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh oh, oh-oh, (hey!)

(All I wanna do)
Turn up, that's all I wanna do
Drink up (more), drink two
Repeat like it's deja vu (oh, oh)
Stay lit, that's all I wanna do
So high, got a wonderful view
I stay so fly, I flew
Yeah, baby, no lie, that's true (oh, oh)
Yeah, baby, I'm cool like (woo)
Damn, baby, I'm cool like (woo)
Yeah...

The girls wanna play with boys
And the boys wanna play with girls
And the girls wanna play with girls
Boys wanna play with boys
So boy, don't you love this world?
The girls wanna play with boys
And the boys wanna play with girls
And the girls wanna play with girls
And the girls wanna play with girls

Yeah...

The girls wanna play with boys
The boys and the girls (oh, oh)
The girls wanna play with boys
The boys and the girls (oh, oh)
The girls wanna play with boys
The boys, the boys, the boys and the girls
