Không Lời|

                        You and I go on at each other like we’re going to war
You and I go rough. We keep throwing things and slamming the door
You and I get so damn dysfunctional, we start keeping score
You and I get sick, yeah I know that we can’t do this no more

But baby there you go again, there you go again, making me love you
Baby, I stopped using my head, using my head. Let it all go
now you’re stuck on my body, on my body like a tattoo
and now I’m feeling stupid, feeling stupid coming back to you

So I cross my heart and i hope to die
that I’ll only stay with you one more night
and I know I said it a million times
but I’ll only stay with you one more night

Try to tell you no but my body keeps on telling you yeah
Try to tell you stop but your lipstick’s got me so out of breath
I’ll be waking up in the morning probably be hating myself
I’ll be waking up inner satisfied, guilty as held

But baby there you go again, there you go again, making me love you
and I stopped using my head, using my head. Let it all go
now you’re stuck on my body, on my body like a tattoo
and now I’m feeling stupid, feeling stupid running back to you

So I cross my heart and i hope to die
that I’ll only stay with you one more night
and I know I said it a million times
but I’ll only stay with you one more night

Yeah maybe we need one more night x3

baby there you go again, there you go again, making me love you
and i stopped using my head, using my head. Let it all go
now you’re stuck on my body, on my body like a tattoo
Yeah... yeah... yeahhhh

So I cross my heart and i hope to die
that I’ll only stay with you one more night
and I know I said it a million times
but I’ll only stay with you one more night x2

Oh maybe we need one more night
