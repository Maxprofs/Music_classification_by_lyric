                        Bài hát: Les Jours Tristes (Void) - Yann Tiersen

Its hard, hard not to sit on your hands
And bury your head in the sand
Hard not to make other plans
And claim that youve done all you can all along
And life must go on
Its hard, hard to stand up for whats right
And bring home the bacon each night
Hard not to break down and cry
When every idea that youve tried has been wrong
But you must go on

Its hard but you know its worth the fight
'Cause you know youve got the truth on your side
When the accusations fly, hold tight
Dont be afraid of what theyll say
Who cares what cowards think, anyway
They will understand one day, one day

Its hard, hard when youre here all alone
And everyone else has gone home
Harder to know right from wrong
When all objectivities gone
And its gone
But you still carry on
'Cause you, you are the only one left
And youve got to clean up the mess
You know youll end like the rest
Bitter and twisted, unless
You stay strong and you carry on

Its hard but you know its worth the fight
'Cause you know youve got the truth on your side
When the accusations fly, hold tight
Dont be afraid of what theyll say
Who cares what cowards think, anyway
They will understand one day, one day
                        
                    |
