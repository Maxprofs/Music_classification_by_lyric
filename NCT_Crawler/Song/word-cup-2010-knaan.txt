                        Give me freedom, give me fire.
Give me reason take me higher.
See the champions,take the field now you difine us,make us feeri proud
In the sreets are, uplinting,as we lose uot inhibition.
Celebration it's around us,every nations, all around us.
Singin forever young, singin song underneath that sun.
Let's rejoice in the beautifull game
And toghetter at the end of the day.
WE ALL SAY
When i get older ,I will be stronger
They'' call me freedom ,Just like a waving flag
And then it goes back
And then it goes back
And then it goes back
And then it goes back
When i get older ,I will be stronger
They'' call me freedom ,Just like a waving flag
And then it goes back
And then it goes back
And then it goes back
And then it goes back
