 (whoo!
 It sure is hot out here
 Ya know?
 I don't mind, though.
 Just glad to be free.
 Know what I'm saying, uh!)

 Take the shackles off my feet so I can dance
 I just wanna praise you
 (what'cha wanna do?)
 I just wanna praise you
 (yeah, yeah)
 You broke the chains now I can lift my hands
 (uh feel me?)
 And I'm gonna praise you
 (what'cha gondo?)
 I'm gonna praise you

 In the corners of my mind
 I just can't seem to find a reason to believe
 That I can break free
 Cause you see I have been down for so long
 Feel like all hope is gone
 But as I lift my hands, I understand
 That I should praise you through my circumstance

 Take the shackles off my feet so I can dance
 I just wanna praise you
 I just wanna praise you
 You broke the chains now I can lift my hands
 And I'm gonna praise you
 I'm gonna praise you

 Everything that could go wrong
 All went wrong at one time
 So much pressure fell on me
 I thought I was gonlose my mind
 But I know you wanna see
 If I will hold on through these trials
 But I need you to lift this load
 Cause I can't take it no more

 Take the shackles off my feet so I can dance
 I just wanna praise you
 I just wanna praise you
 You broke the chains now I can lift my hands
 And I'm gonna praise you
 I'm gonna praise you

 Been through the fire and the rain
 Bound in every kind of way
 But God has broken every chain
 So let me go right now

 Take the shackles off my feet so I can dance
 I just wanna praise you
 I just wanna praise you
 You broke the chains now I can lift my hands
 And I'm gonna praise you
 I'm gonna praise you
 (repeat x3)

 Take them off
 What'cha gonna do, yeah

 Take the shackles off my feet so I can dance
 I just wanna praise you
 I just wanna praise you
 You broke the chains now I can lift my hands
 And I'm gonna praise you
 I'm gonna praise you
