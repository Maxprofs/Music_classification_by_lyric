Phil Collins - The Way You Look Tonight (Live)
Some day, when I'm awfully low,
And the world is cold,
I will feel a glow just thinking of you...
And the way you look tonight.

But you're lovely, with your smile so warm
And your cheek so soft,
There is nothing for me but to love you,
Just the way you look tonight.

With each word your tenderness grows,
Tearing my soul apart...
And that laugh that wrinkles your nose,
Touches my foolish heart.

But you're lovely, never never change.
Keep that breathless charm.
Won't you please arrange it ?
'Cause I love you
Just the way you look tonight.

But you're lovely, never never change.
Keep that breathless charm.
Won't you please arrange it ?
'Cause I love you
Just the way you look
Just the way you look
Just the way you look tonight.
