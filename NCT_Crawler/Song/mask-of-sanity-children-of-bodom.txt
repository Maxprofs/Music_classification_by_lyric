                        Aaa aoh I can't waste away
 I'm slowly losin' my way forever
 I better raise your slave for me anymore
 Daylight's sin inside
 Days growing closer, wait for pain
 I cannot wait another night to be alone Uh, the voices are calling me
 Be my knight
 This devil sigh
 Yeao, shadows are tainting me
 Yeao, I know that only you can render pain Peace of mind
 You run away from me
 So make me lose my
 Mask of sanity I can't waste away
 I'm slowly getting my way alone
 Better is what I used to feel alone
 Shattered lights, sin in taint
 Days growing longer, wait for pain
 I cannot wait another night to be with you Yea Peace of mind
 You run away from me
 So make me lose my
 Mask of sanity Peace of mind
 You run away from me
 So make me lose my
 Mask of sanity
