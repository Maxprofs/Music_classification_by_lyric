                        Song: We Run The Night - Havana Brown, Pitbull

Havana Brown
Red One
Mr. Worldwide
From Miami, Morocco, to Australia
To the world.
Run em like run em run em, whoop!
Run em like run em run em, whoop!

[ Havana Brown ] :
When the sun goes down down down down
Boy are you afraid of dark dark
And when the lights go out out out out
Tell me do you know where to start start
And when the bass gets loud loud loud
That is when i feel a part, apart
And when the world sleeps sound sound sound
well the sound is the key of my heart

Chorus:
We run, yes we run the night.
we run, yes we run the night
we-we-we run, we-we-we run
we run, yes we run the night
Run em like run em run em whoop!
Run em like run em run em whoop!
Run em like run em run em whoop!

[ Pitbull ] :
From the bottom of the map, Miami
To the land down under, Australia
You feel my draft, see my vision and hear my hunger
As my money gets older, their's get younger
They sell their soul
But the devil knows I have no number
I'm global baby hey!
Official baby hey!
Go go baby hey!
Oh oh baby hey!
No no baby hey!
Yeah yeah baby hey!
Now jiggle it baby
Let me tickle it baby
I know I'm lost
It's gonna be hard to save me
I'm sorry that's how Dade County raised me
Ya heard me right
We run the night
Now f*** you pay me

Chorus:
We run, yes we run the night.
We run, yes we run the night
We-we-we run, we-we-we run
We run, yes we run the night
Run em like run em run em whoop!
Run em like run em run em whoop!
Run em like run em run em whoop!

[ Havana Brown ] :
Feel it like a rush rush rush
Brushing past me all over my skin skin
I can't get enough 'nough 'nough
Cause the beat keep pulling me in
Taking me so high up up up
A place that i've never been
Party party all night night night
Sleep all day ..then do it again

[Chorus:]
We run, yes we run the night.
Run em like run em run em whoop!
we run, yes we run the night
we-we-we run, we-we-we run
we run, yes we run the night, the night
Run em like run em run em whoop!
                        
                    |
