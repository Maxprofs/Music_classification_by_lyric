                        I've been in and out of favor with lady luck
 I gotta tell you, I've seen things I never wanted to see
 I've got to get back on my feet, I feel like I've been sleeping
 Sweet, sweet time has been a real good friend of mine Waiting for that change of season
 Oh, the winter's been so long
 Searching for that rhyme or reason
 You've just got to Move on, yeah
 Hold it together, move on, move on
 Life's so short, move on, only time will set you free
 You put your tears behind you, better get yourself where you wanna be
 I think of all the days and nights I spent crying and I move on I've been in and out of favor with love because I gotta tell you
 I've been things I never wanted to be
 And then some angel called me up, he told me I was sleeping
 Said "Don't waste time 'cos even angels say goodbye" Waiting for that change of season
 Oh, the winter's been so long
 Searching for that rhyme or reason
 You've just got to Move on, yeah
 Hold it together, move on, move on
 Life's so short, move on, only time will set you free
 You put your tears behind you, better get yourself where you wanna be
 I think of all the days and nights I spent crying and I move on And oh, there goes another season
 Getting hard to find a decent song to play
 But oh, I guess I got my reasons
 Everybody thinks I'm doing a.o.k
 They ought to know by now, yeah Oh, that such a thing should make a mark on your life
 And don't you think that maybe, moving on good advice?
 Move on, I tell you Move on, yeah
 Hold it together, move on, move on
 Life's so short, move on, only time will set you free
 You put your tears behind you, better get yourself where you wanna be
 I think of all the days and nights I spent crying and I move on And life, she won't wait for me to move on
 Put your feelings behind you
 Better get yourself where you wanna be
 I think of all the days and nights I spent crying
 Until my angel set me free I'm gonna be lucky in love someday
 I'm gonna be lucky in love someday
