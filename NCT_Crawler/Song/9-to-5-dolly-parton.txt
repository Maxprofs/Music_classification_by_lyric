                        Tumble outta bed and I stumble to the kitchen
 Pour myself a cup of ambition
 And yawnin', stretchin', try to come to life Jump in the shower and the blood starts pumpin'
 Out on the streets, the traffic starts jumpin'
 With folks like me on the job from 9 to 5 Workin' 9 to 5, what a way to make a livin'
 Barely gettin' by, it's all takin' and no givin'
 They just use your mind and they never give you credit
 It's enough to drive you crazy if you let it 9 to 5, for service and devotion
 You would think that I would deserve a fair promotion
 Want to move ahead but the boss won't seem to let me
 I swear sometimes that man is out to get me They let your dream, just watch 'em shatter
 You're just a step on the boss man's ladder
 But you got dreams he'll never take away In the same boat with a lot of your friends
 Waitin' for the day your ship 'll come in
 And the tide's gonna turn an' it's all gonna roll you away Workin' 9 to 5 what a way to make a livin'
 Barely gettin' by, it's all takin' and no givin'
 They just use your mind and you never get the credit
 It's enough to drive you crazy if you let it 9 to 5, yeah, they got you where they want you
 There's a better life and you think about it, don't you?
 It's a rich man's game, no matter what they call it
 And you spend your life putting money in his wallet Workin' 9 to 5, oh what a way to make a livin'
 Barely gettin' by, it's all takin' and no givin'
 They just use you mind and they never give you credit
 It's enough to drive you crazy if you let it 9 to 5, yeah, they got you where they want you
 There's a better life and you think about it, don't you?
 It's a rich man's game, no matter what they call it
 And you spend your life putting money in his wallet
