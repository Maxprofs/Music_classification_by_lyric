                        (Verse)
We’ve been hanging on all night,
Everything’s been so nice,
Wish I didn’t have to go.

Oh, you look so sexy,
Touching you so gently,
But I gotta get you home.

(Pre-Chorus)
So many things to tell you,
So long since I held you,
Uh, girl, you just don’t know.

Here’s my proposition,
Don’t speak, you just listen,
Before we go down this road

(Chorus)
Take the long way home,
I’m not trying to leave you now,
Ain’t no rest, can’t we slow down?
Taking the long way home,
I know that we’re pulling up
Somewhere around the block so we can touch some more.

Kiss me while we run,
Touch me while we run,
Just take you the long way home.
Kiss me while we run,
Touch me while we run,
Just take you the long way home.

(Verse)
Wish I could stay all night
But I just can’t tonight
Cause I gotta be up at 6.
Girl, you melt my heart now,
When you took of my seatbelt
And told me to come give you a kiss.

(Pre-Chorus)
So many things to tell you,
So long since I held you,
Uh, girl, you just don’t know.

Here’s my proposition,
Don’t speak, you just listen,
Before we go down this road

(Chorus)
Take the long way home,
I’m not trying to leave you now,
Ain’t no rest, can’t we slow down?
Taking the long way home,
I know that we’re pulling up
Somewhere around the block so we can touch some more.

Kiss me while we run,
Touch me while we run,
Just take you the long way home.
Kiss me while we run,
Touch me while we run,
Just take you the long way home.

(Bridge)
Something about you makes me wanna drive
All night, all night, all night long.
I can’t wait until the next time I see you again.

(Chorus)
Take you the long way home,
I’m not trying to leave you now,
Ain’t no rest, can’t we slow down?
Take you he long way home,
I know that we’re pulling up
Somewhere around the block so we can touch some more.

Kiss me while we run,
Touch me while we run,
Just take you the long way home.
Kiss me while we run,
Touch me while we run,
Just take you the long way home.

Kiss me while we run,
Touch me while we run,
Just take you the long way home.
Kiss me while we run,
Touch me while we run,
Just take you the long way home.
