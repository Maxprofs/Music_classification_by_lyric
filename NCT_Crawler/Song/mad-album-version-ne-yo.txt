                        (VERSE 1)
She's starin' at me
I'm sittin', wonderin' what she's thinkin'
Mmmmmm
Nobody's talkin' 'cause talkin' just turns into screamin'
Ohhh
And now is i'm yellin' over her, she's yellin' over me
All that that means
is neither of us is listening
[and what's even worse]
that we don't even remember why were fighting.


So both of us are mad for...


(HOOK)
Nothin' [fighting for]
Nothin' [crying for]
Nothin' [whooaaa]
But we wont let it go for nothin'
[no not for]
Nothin'
This should be nothin' to a love like what we got
Ohhh baby...

I know sometimes it's gonna rain
but baby, can we make up now
'cause I can't sleep through the pain
[can't sleep through the pain].

(CHORUS)
Girl, i don't wanna go to bed
[mad at you]
And i don't want you to go to bed
[mad at me]
No, i don't wanna go to bed
[mad at you]
And i don't want you to go to bed
[mad at me]
Ohhh no no no...


(VERSE 2)

And it gets me upset, girl
when your constantly accusing.
[askin' questions like you've already known]
We're fighting this war, baby
when both of us are losing.
[This ain't the way that love is supposed to go].

Whoahhhh.....
[what happened to workin' it out]
We've fall into this place
where you ain't backin' down and i ain't backin' down
so what the hell do we do now...

It's all for..

(HOOK)
Nothin' [fighting for]
Nothin' [crying for]
Nothin' [whooaaa]
but we won't let it go for
nothin'...
[no not for]
Nothin'
This should be nothin' to a love like what we got
Ohhh baby...

I know sometimes it's gonna rain
but baby, can we make up now
'cause I can't sleep through the pain
[can't sleep through the pain].

(CHORUS)
Girl, i don't wanna go to bed
[mad at you]
And i don't want you to go to bed
[mad at me]
No, i don't wanna go to bed
[mad at you]
And i don't want you to go to bed
[mad at me]
Ohhh no no no...


(BRIDGE)
Oh, baby this love ain't gonna be perfect
[perfect, perfect, ohh ohh]
and just how good it's gonna be
we can fuss and we can fight long as everythings allright between us...
before we go to sleep.

Baby, we're gonna be happy.

Baby I know sometimes it's gonna rain
but baby, can we make up now
'cause I can't sleep through the pain
[can't sleep through the pain].

(CHORUS)
Girl, i don't wanna go to bed
[mad at you]
And i don't want you to go to bed
[mad at me]
No, i don't wanna go to bed
[mad at you]
And i don't want you to go to bed
[mad at me]
Ohhh no no no...
