                        Bài hát: I Don't Wanna Die - Nightcore

I don't wanna die, I don't wanna die
 I don't wanna die so you're gonna have to
 I don't wanna die, I don't wanna die
 No I don't wanna die so you're gonna have to
 Blood is getting hotter, body's getting colder
I told you once I'm the only one who holds her
 I don't wanna die, I don't wanna die
 I don't wanna die so you're gonna have to

 I look inside of myself and try to find someone else
Someone who's willin' todie as to watch you crying for help
 I know that blood will be...
