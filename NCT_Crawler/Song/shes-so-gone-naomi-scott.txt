                        Insecure
 In a skin
 Like a puppet, a girl on a string Broke away
 Learn to fly
 If you want her back gotta let it shine So it looks like the joke's on you
 'Cause the girl that you thought you knew She's so gone
 That's so over now
 She's so gone
 You won't find her around
 You can look but you won't see
 The girl I used to be
 'Cause she's
 She's so gone Here I am
 This is me
 And I'm stronger than you ever thought I'd be Are you shocked?
 Are you mad?
 That you're missing out on who I really am So it looks like the joke's on you
 'Cause the girl that you thought you knew She's so gone
 That's so over now
 She's so gone
 You won't find her around
 You can look but you won't see
 The girl I used to be
 'Cause she's
 She's so gone away
 Like kiss the rain
 She's so gone
 Baby, this is me, yeah She's so gone
 That's so over now
 She's so gone
 You won't find her around
 You can look but you won't see
 The girl I used to be
 'Cause she's
 She's so gone
 She's so gone You can look but you won't see
 The girl I used to be
 'Cause she's
 She's so gone So long
 She's so gone
 Gone, gone, gone
