Katharine McPhee - Love Story

I think it was the summertime
When I laid eyes on you
I didn't even know your name
Somehow we'd end up in the same room
It never crossed my mind
I never saw you like that
I should've listened to my best friend
She knew it would be a perfect match

It's a typical love story
Started out as friends
We met way back when
This is just a typical love story
The boy you never wanted just steals your heart
I never saw it comin' 'til I fell so hard

I always made up some excuse
Saying you that weren't my type
Didn't want to face the truth
Didn't want to cross that line
'til one day I saw you
Out of the corner of my eye
You were flirting with some girl
And inside I thought I would die

It's a typical love story
Started out as friends
We met way back when
This is just a typical love story
The boy you never wanted just steals your heart
I never saw it comin' 'til I fell so hard

Can't believe its happening
When I least expect it
My prince under disguise
How you fooled me with those eyes
When I feel like letting go
In your arms is where I know
I am wrong
From the beginning we always belong

Love Love Story
Love Love Story
Love Love Story (Love)
Love Love Story (Love Story)
Love Love Story (This is my)
Love Love Story (This is my love story)
Love Love Story
Love
This is my love story

It's a typical love story
Started out as friends
This is how it ends
This is just a typical love story
The boy you never wanted just steals your heart
I never saw it comin' 'til I fell so hard

It's a typical love story
Started out as friends
This is how it ends
This is just a typical love story
The boy you never wanted just steals your heart
I never saw it comin' 'til I fell so hard
