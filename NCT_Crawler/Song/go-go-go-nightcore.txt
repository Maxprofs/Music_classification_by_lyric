                        Bài hát: Go Go Go - Nightcore

(CHORUS:)
Tell me why should I let you go go go go
You know I love you so, so, so, so
That's why I am here tonight
So put your hands up
Why shouldn't I flow, flow, flow, flow
And pump it up on stereo, oh, oh, oh
It's time to stomp on five

Ladies and gentlemen, the 89ers are back
Come on, let's go

(VERSE1:)
This song is for you and that's no lie
You can't imagine how hard I really try
To satisfy you every day
Don't let you do what's coming at me
You're doing it like a killer bee
Hey, hey, it's alright
We have to stop while we're feelin' fine
Ho, ho, you take my hand
89ers is a punk dance band

(CHORUS:)
Just tell me why
Should I let you go, go, go, go
Because I love you so, so, so
That's why I am here tonight
So put your hands up
Why shouldn't I let it flow, flow, flow, flow
And pump it up on stereo, oh, oh, oh
It's time to stomp on five

(VERSE2:)
Come with me, let's go for a ride
Follow me to the brighter side
Pretty girl just look around
That everybody is jumping around to the 89ers sound
Hey, hey, what's that noise?
Rushin' into ears of the girls and the boys
Oh, oh, enjoy the show
That the 89ers have a punch line flow

(CHORUS:)
Please tell me why
Should I let you go, go, go, go
Because I love you so, so, so, so
That's why I am here tonight
So put your hands up
Why shouldn't I let it flow, flow, flow, flow
And pump it up on stereo, oh, oh, oh
It's time to stomp on five

(CHORUS:)
Please tell me why
Should I let you go, go, go, go
Because I love you so, so, so, so
That's why I am here tonight
So put your hands up
Why shouldn't I let it flow, flow, flow, flow
And pump it up on stereo, oh, oh, oh
It's time to stomp on five
