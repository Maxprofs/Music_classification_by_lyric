                        I got enough on my mind that when she pulls me by the hair
She hasn't much to hold onto

She keeping count on her hand One, Two, Three days
That I been sleeping on my side

I finished kissing my death, so now I head back up the steps

Thinking about where I've been, I mean the sun was never like this

I wanna feel with the season. I guess it makes sense

Cause my lifes become as vapid as a night out in Los Angeles

And I just want to stay in bed, and hold you like I used to

You know that I am home, so darling if you love me

Would you let me know...

Or go on, go on, go on, if you were thinking that the worst is yet to come

Why and I the one always packing all my stuff

For once, for once, for once, I get the feeling that I'm right where I
Belong

Why am I the one always packing all my stuff

She got enough on her mind

That she feel no sorrow

I let my fate fill the air

So now she rollin down her window

Never been one to hold on

But I need a last breath

So I ask if she remembers when

She used to come and visit me

We were fools to think that nothing could go wrong

Go on, go on, go on, if you were thinking that the worst is yet to come

Why am I the one always packing all my stuff

For once, for once, for once, I get the feeling that I'm right where I
Belong

Why am I the one always packing all my stuff

I think I kinda like it but I might of had too much

I'll move back down to this western town

When they find me out make no mistake about it

I'll move back down to this western town

When they find me out make no mistake about it

I'll move back down to this western town...

Go on, go on, go on, if you were thinkin that the worst is yet to come

Why am I the one always packin all stuff

Go on, go on, go on, if you were thinkin that the worst is yet to come

Why am I the one always packin all my stuff


For once, for once, for once, I get the feeling that I'm right where I
Belong

Why am I the one always packin all my stuff

I think I kinda like it but I might of had too much

And I'll move back down...
