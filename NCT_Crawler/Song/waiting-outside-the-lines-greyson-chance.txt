                        You'll never enjoy your life
Livin' inside the box
You're so afraid of taking chances
How are you going to reach the top?

Rules and regulations
Force you to play it safe
Get rid of all the hesitation
It's time for you to seize the day

Instead of just sitting around
And looking down on tomorrow
You gotta let your feet off the ground
The time is now

I'm waiting, waiting, just waiting
I'm waiting, waiting outside the lines
Waiting outside the lines
Waiting outside the lines

Try to have no regrets
Even if it's just tonight
How you gonna walk ahead
If you keep living blind

Stuck in the same position
You deserve so much more
There's a whole world around us
Just waiting to be explored

Instead of just sitting around
And looking down on tomorrow
You gotta let your feet off the ground
The time is now, just let it go

I don't want to have to force you to smile
I'm here to help you notice the rainbow
'Cause I know what's in you is out there

I'm waiting, waiting, just waiting
I'm waiting, waiting outside the lines
Waiting outside the lines
Waiting outside the lines

I'm trying to be patient
(trying to be patient)
The first step is the hardest
(the hardest)
I know you can make it
Go ahead and take it

I'm waiting, waiting, just waiting
I'm waiting
I'm waiting, waiting, just waiting
I'm waiting, waiting outside the lines

Waiting outside the lines
Waiting outside the lines

You'll never enjoy your life
Livin' inside the box
You're so afraid of taking chances
How are you going to reach the top?
