                        Bài hát : Where No One Goes - John Powell

Let the wind carry us
Through the clouds, hurry up, all right
We can travel so far
As our eyes can see

We go where no one goes
We slow for no one
Can not follow us

Awake in the sky
We break up so high, all right
Let's make it around, let's savour it

We go where no one goes
We slow for no one
Can not follow us

We slow for no one
We go where no one goes
[x2]

We go where no one goes
                        
                    |
