                        Song: Girlfriend (Album Version) - NSYNC

Would you be my girlfriend
Would you be my girlfriend
Would you be my girlfriend
You know I like you right?
Would you be my girlfriend

I don't know why you care
He doesn't even know you're there (Oh no)
'Cause he don't love your eyes
And he don't love your smile
Girl you know that ain't fair

In the middle of the night
Is he gonna be by your side?
Or will he run and hide?
You don't know 'cause things ain't clear
And baby when you cry
Is he gonna stand by your side?
Does the man even know you're alive?
I got an idea!

Why don't you be my girlfriend
I'll treat you good (I'll treat you good girl)
I know you hear your friends when they say you should
'Cause if you were my girlfriend
I'd be your shining star
The one to show you where you are
Girl you should be my girlfriend

Does he know what you feel (does he know what you feel?)
Are you sure that it's real yeah (are you sure?)
Does he ease your mind (nah)
Or does he break your stride? (c'mon)
Did you know that love could be a shield yeah

In the middle of the night
Is he gonna be by your side?
Or will he run and hide?
You don't know 'cause things ain't clear
And baby when you cry
Is he gonna stand by your side?
Does the man even know you're alive?
I got an idea!

Why don't you be my girlfriend
I'll treat you good (I'll treat you good girl)
I know you hear your friends when they say you should
'Cause if you were my girlfriend
I'd be your shining star
The one to show you where you are
Girl you should be my girlfriend

Ever since I saw your face
Nothing in my life has been the same
I walk around just saying your name
Without you my world would end, yeah
I've searched around this whole damn place
And everything says you were meant to be
My girlfriend, oh

Why don't you be my girlfriend
I'll treat you good
I know you hear your friends when they say you should
'Cause if you were my girlfriend
I'd be your shining star
The one to show you where you are
Girl you should be my girlfriend

Girl You Should Be My Girlfriend
Girl You Should Be My Girlfriend
Girl You Should Be My Girlfriend
Girl You Should Be My Girlfriend
Girl You Should Be My Girlfriend
My Girlfriend!
