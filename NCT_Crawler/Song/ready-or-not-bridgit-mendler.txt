                        Bài hát: Ready Or Not - Bridgit Mendler

I’m the kinda girl who doesn’t say a word,
Who sits at the curb and waits for the world
But I’m about to break out, about to break out
I’m like a crook tonight

I caught you staring at me and I was thinking clearly
And now I’m like a bee and I’m huntin’ for the honey
And I’m kinda shy but you’re super fly yeah I could be your kryptonite

Like ohh ohh ohh
Light my heart up baby like a matchstick
Ohh ohh ohh
And hit the gas quick

Ready or not
Here I come
Where you at?
The night is young
In the crowd the music’s loud but I will find you
Ready or not
Here I come
I like your face
Do you like my song?
Just sing it la la la la la la and I'll find you
Ready or not
Ready or not

Hello my name is...
Nice to meet you
I think you’re famous
Where have I seen you?
You’ll be my William, I’ll be your Kate
Livin’ like a fairytale
We could have a palace right next to Oprah
37 cars and a yacht down in Boca
Take me away whereever you say
Yeah we could be setting sail

Like ohh ohh ohh
Light my heart up baby like a matchstick
Ohh ohh ohh
And hit the gas quick

Ready or not
Here I come
Where you at?
The night is young
In the crowd the music’s loud but I will find you
Ready or not
Here I come
I like your face
Do you like my song?
Just sing it la la la la la la and I will find you
Ready or not
Ready or not

Ready or not here I come here I come
You’re like a breath of fresh air in my lungs
You and me dance from the night to the dawn
Ready or not here I come boy it's on

Ready or not here I come here I come
You’re like a breath of fresh air in my lungs
You and me dance from the night to the dawn
Ready or not here I come boy it's on

Ready or not
Here I come
Where you at?
The night is young
In the crowd the music’s loud but I will find you
Ready or not
Here I come
I like your face
Do you like my song?
Just sing it la la la la la la and I'll find you

Ready or not (You're like a breath of fresh air in my lungs)
Ready or not (Here I come, ohhhh)
Ready or not
Ready or not
Ready or not
Ready or not
Boombada Boombada Boombada
Ready or not!
