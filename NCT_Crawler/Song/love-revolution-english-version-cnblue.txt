                        Love Revolution (English Version) - CNBLUE

Something like in the sky 
Uh... I can't define 
But certain thing in my heart, 
You know I can realize 
Like fairy tale I heard 
Precious thing in my heart 
Tell me how you feel, what what? uh same I do 

Something like a toy I got 
Yeah, I can remind 
My love is shining in my heart, it is so clear and mind 
Like fairy tale I heard 
Precious things in my heart 
Tell me how you feel, what what? 

I want you in my life (in the castle, in the air) 
I want you kiss me everyday (I take your hand, my dear) 
I want you in my life (I don't want you fly away) 
I want you smiling at me everyday (You're my dreaming days) 
If your love won't stay with me forever 
I'll be loving you, whenever 
You in my life (tell me everything's alright) 
I wanna be your shining light, do you know? 

Holdin' my pillow tight 
Oh girl, I can smile 
You are the part of my place, I don't tell you a lie 
You're every breath I take 
You're every step I make 
It's not a fake thing my love, oh let me remind you 

I'm feeling it inside 
The heaven in the sky 
You are the part of my life, girl it's not a lie 
Rolling down to my bed 
Gather and through my head 
It's not a fake thing my love 

I want you in my life (in the castle, in the air) 
I want you kiss me everyday (I take your hand, my dear) 
I want you in my life (I don't want you fly away) 
I want you smiling at me everyday (You're my dreaming days) 
If your love won't stay with me forever 
I'll be loving you, whenever 
You in my life (tell me everything's alright) 
I wanna be your shining light 

I don't wanna make your love an illusion 
I believe in you, don't tell me lies 
I don't wanna make your love an illusion 
Baby girl, your love is so true 
I don't wanna let you go 

(One, two, three, four) 
I want you in my life (in the castle, in the air) 
I want you kiss me everyday (I take your hand, my dear) 
I want you in my life (I don't want you fly away) 
I want you smiling at me everyday (You're my dreaming days) 
If your love won't stay with me forever 
I'll be loving you, whenever 
You in my life (Tell me everything's alright) 
I wanna be your shining light... 
It's right
