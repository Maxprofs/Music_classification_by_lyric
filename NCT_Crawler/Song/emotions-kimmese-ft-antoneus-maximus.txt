                        Song: Emotions - Kimmese, Antoneous Maximus

I cry many times at night 
Think about you all the time 
Your voice is on my mind it hurts so much inside 
Even though we try and try 
Break up to make up gets tired 
Always mad at you, you’re mad at me, time to say goodbye


Our love ain’t strong, couldn’t survive thru all these struggles 
Couldn’t never last too many troubles 
Can’t stand, the pain 
You cried for me, I cried for you babe 
Couldn’t believe all things we use to do


One thing stays on my mind 
The look that was in your eyes 
Why couldn’t I see at that time 
That you loved me and you tried 
Now you’re gone I ain’t mad at you 
Never wanted to let you go 
I wish I could hold you again 
But its too late, now baby I know


Look into my eyes 
What do you see? 
All I see is the hatred 
Isn’t that what you told me 
Why am I crying bout you and I 
It was all lies 
It was all lies 
All I do is cry cry 
All you say is lie lie 
Such a fool am I, I, I 
But I’l be fine once I get you out of my mind 
All I do is cry cry 
All you say is lie lie 
Such a fool am I, I, I 
I just wanna get you out of my mind


OUT OF SIGHT OUT OF MIND 
I DONT MIND THIS 
SICK OF ALL THE LYIN AND THE CRYIN GIRL IM DYING OVER HERE 
YOU NEED TO STOP WITH THE WINING 
GLAD YOU'D REALIZED YOU AND I WRONG TIMING 
GIRL YOU KNOW THAT YOU IS NO ANGEL 
CUZ IT ALWAYS TAKES TWO TWO TO TANGO 
BUT SOMEHOW I GET I GET THE BLAME THOUGH 
LOOK IN THE MIRROR ITS YOU THROWIN' THE LOW BLOW 
WHY DOES IT HAVE TO BE THIS WAY 
WHAT HAPPENED TO IT WILL BE OK 
I KNOW THAT I AM NOT PERFECT 
BUT I TRY REALLY HARD TO MAKE IT WORTH IT 
YOU'RE STILL A DIAMOND HOPE U KEEP SHININ' 
I JUST GOTTA DO WHAT I DO 
NO MORE HIDIN' THE TRUTH 
U AND I WE GOTTA LET GO 
CUZ I DONT WANT TO HURT YOU NO MORE

Our love ain’t strong, couldn’t survive thru all these struggles 
Couldn’t never last too many troubles 
Can’t stand, the pain 
You cried for me, I cried for you babe 
Couldn’t believe all things we use to do 
All i do is cry.......
