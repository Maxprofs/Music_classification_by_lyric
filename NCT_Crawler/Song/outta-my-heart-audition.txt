                        What? Is that all you've got to say?
What? What? You're rubbing me the wrong way
See your lips moving
But I don't catch a word you say
Shut up your chatter
I need for you to go away, uh huh

[CHORUS]
And all I hear is ay ya ya ya ya
You're talking way too much
I can't even hear me now
All your noise is messing with my head
You're in my head
Get outta my head

Outta my, outta my head
Want you outta my head
Outta my, outta my head
Get outta my head
Outta my outta my head
Want you outta my head
Outta my, outta my head

That's what I said
What? You looking at me for huh?
Show me respect or I will show you the door (Get out the door)

Lately, I've got a problem with the way that you behave
You're too much, and all your questions don't leave me no time for me, ha ha ha

[REPEAT CHORUS X2]

All your opinions, keep them to yourself
Just let me think so I can hear myself
Wouldn't it be nice if I could just go solo, take the day off?
I'd be alright if you would leave me to it, back off F**** off
Ay ya ya ya ya
You're talking way too much
You tell me one more time how I should live
I swear I'll bite your head off
I am who I am And I can't be no one else
You got nothing left to say
Keep your comments to yourself
Awww!

Outta my, outta my head
Want you outta my head
Outta my, outta my head
Get outta my head
Outta my outta my head
Want you outta my head
Outta my, outta my head
                        
                    |
