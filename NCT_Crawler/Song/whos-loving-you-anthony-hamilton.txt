                        Say you wanna walk out say you wanna leave
 I can tell by the way we make love
 You say things you don't believe
 It's like your mind says no but your hearts is sayin yes
 I felt the one inside that we can...
 So I try to confuse you with happiness
 Yes I do say

 Pre chorus:
 God only knows
 Are you really are feeling inside
 So I... Back in...
 She said you're runnin with... In the sky

 Chorus:
 Baby I'm missing you crazy, I'm missing you like crazy
 I've been thinking try me seeking wanna...
 Who's loving you baby, I'm missing you crazy
 I've been thinking try me seeking wanna...
 Who's loving you now

 All my friends say you're gonna be okay
 But days are start to...
 And more just to turn to make
 And say you wanna be alone
 But I see you...
 'Cause love is your religion girl you might hate the song
 But you love to pain...

 [Pre chorus:]
 [Chorus:]
 Who's loving you now
                        
                    |
