                        Bài hát: Last Friday Night - Katy Perry, Missy Elliott

(Missy)
Oh Katy. Let see 'em with the remix, baby.
T.G.I.F.

Is a friday night, now here we go.
I ain't no stripper but i work the pole.
Bartender, can you pour some more.
And i so tipsy comin' out my club.

Let's fly high high high.
And i can see so i can drive.
I party till i'm out my mind.
I kiss on him but he don't mind.

Then i wake up in the mornin'
Got a guy in my bed like hello good mornin'
Don't remember how i got a home.
But friday night it was nice so...

(Katy):
Last Friday night
Yeah we danced on tabletops
And we took too many shots
Think we kissed but I forgot

Last Friday night
Yeah we maxed our credit cards
And got kicked out of the bar
So we hit the boulevard

Last Friday night
We went streaking in the park
Skinny dipping in the dark
Then had a menage a trois

Last Friday night
Yeah I think we broke the law
Always say we're gonna stop-op
Whoa-oh-oah

This Friday night
Do it all again(x2)

Trying to connect the dots
Don't know what to tell my boss
Think the city towed my car
Chandelier is on the floor
Ripped my favorite party dress
Warrants out for my arrest
Think I need a ginger ale
That was such an epic fail

Pictures of last night
Ended up online
I'm screwed
Oh well
It's a blacked out blur
But I'm pretty sure it ruled
Damn

Last Friday night
Yeah we danced on table tops
And we took too many shots
Think we kissed but I forgot

Last Friday night
Yeah we maxed our credits card
And got kicked out of the bar
So we hit the boulevard

Last Friday night
We went streaking in the park
Skinny dipping in the dark
Then had a menage a trois

Last Friday night
Yeah I think we broke the law
Always say we're gonna stop-op
Oh whoa oh

This Friday night
Do it all again
Do it all again(x2)
This Friday night...

(Missy)
T.G.I.F(x3)
Let's do this like every weekend
T.G.I.F(x3)
Now pour my drink till there ain't nothin' left
T.G.I.F(x3)
