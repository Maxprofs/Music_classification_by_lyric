                        How do I breathe?
How do I breathe?
Mmm mmm

It feels so different being here, I was so used to being next to you
Life for me is not the same, there’s no one to talk to
I don't know why I let it go too far, starting over it's so hard
Seems like everywhere I try to go I keep thinking of you

I just had a wakeup call wishing that I never let you fall
Baby you are not to blame at all when I'm the one that pushed you away
Maybe if you knew I cared you’d’ve never went nowhere
Girl I should have been right there

How do I breathe without you here by my side?
How will I see when your love brought me to the light?
Where do I go when your heart’s where I lay my head?
When you’re not with me, how do I breathe, how do I breathe?

Girl I'm losing my mind, yes I made a mistake
I thought that you would be mine, guess the joke was on me
I miss you so bad I can’t sleep, I wish I knew where you could be
Another dude is replacing me, god this can’t be happening!

I just had a wakeup call wishing that I never let you fall
Baby you are not to blame at all when I'm the one that pushed you away
Maybe if you knew I cared you’d’ve never went nowhere
Girl I should have been right there
And I wonder

How do I breathe without you here by my side?
How will I see when your love brought me to the light?
Where do I go when your heart’s where I lay my head?
When you’re not with me, how do I breathe, how do I breathe?

Ooh, I should’ve brought my love home, girl
And baby I ain’t perfect, you know
The grind has got a tight hold, girl, come back to me
‘Cause girl you made it hard to breathe when you’re not with me

Tell me, how do I breathe without you here by my side?
How will I see when your love brought me to the light?
Where do I go when your heart’s where I lay my head?
When you’re not with me how do I breathe?

How do I breathe without you here by my side?
How will I see when your love brought me to the light?
Where do I go when your heart’s where I lay my head?
When you’re not with me, how do I breathe, how do I breathe?
