                        I'm looking, I'm looking for a foxy love
 Yeah... I'm a wolf in sheep's clothes, baby
 And I'm hunting for a foxy love
 I might look like a little lost lamb
 But you should hear me howl
 When the full moon shines above Mary had a little lamb
 His fleece was white as snow
 But that was really me
 In sheep disguise
 That's a fact I bet you did not know I'm a wolf in sheep's clothing
 I'm hunting for a foxy love
 Well, I might look like a little lost lamb
 But you should hear me howl when the full moon,
 The moon shines above Little lamb chops, she's such an innocent thing
 At least I thought that to be true
 But I found out, late one night
 She was a wolf in sheep skin too Because I'm a wolf in sheep's clothes, baby
 I'm hunting for a foxy love
 I might look like a little lost lamb
 You should hear me howl
 When the full moon shines above Let me howl now! [Instrumental] Little Bo Peep, you know she lost her sheep
 Nowhere could they be seen
 I shouted, hey Bo Peep, forget them sheep
 Come spend the night with me I'm a wolf in sheep's clothes,
 Baby, I'm looking for a foxy love
 I might look like a little lost lamb
 You should hear me howl
 When the full moon shines above I'm a wolf in sheep's clothing
 And I'm looking for a foxy love
 Well might look like a little lost lamb
 You should hear me howl
 When the full moon shines above
