                        Bài hát: Why Try - Ariana Grade

I've been living with devils and angels, angels, angels
Realize we were not in the same boat, same boat, yeah
Kills me, how you love me then you
Cut me down, I'll do the same
We been living like angels and devils, devils

I'm loving the pain
I never wanna live without it
So why do I try?
You drive me insane
Now we're screaming just to see who's louder
So why do I try?
You got me like (na na na na na na na na, na na na na na na na) (oh, yeah)

You and I redefine being lovesick, lovesick, lovesick
Through it all, you could still make my heart skip, heart skip, oh yeah
Even when you're yelling at me
I still think you're beautiful
Through it all you could still make my heart skip, heart skip

I'm loving the pain
I never wanna live without it
So why do I try?
You drive me insane
Now we're screaming just to see who's louder
So why do I try?
You got me like (na na na na na na na na, na na na na na na na)

Oh baby, look at us
We been living like angels, living like devils
Oh baby, look at us
We been loving like angels, loving like devils
Oh baby, look at us
We been living like angels, living like devils
Oh baby, look at us
We been loving like angels, loving like devils, oh baby, look

I'm loving the pain
I never wanna live without it
So why do I try? (do I try)
You drive me insane
Now we're screaming just to see who's louder
So why do I try?
You got me like (na na na na na na na na, na na na na na na na)

Na na na na na na na, na na na na na na na, na na na na na na na
