                        Bài hát: Do They Know It's Christmas Time - Band Aid 20

[Chris Martin:]
It's Christmastime, there's no need to be afraid
At Christmastime, we let in light and we banish shade

[Dido:]
And in our world of plenty we can spread a smile of joy
Throw your arms around the world at Christmastime

[Robbie Williams:]
But say a prayer, Pray for the other ones
At Christmastime it's hard, but when you're having fun

[Sugababes:]
There's a world outside your window
And it's a world of dread and fear

[Fran Healy:]
Where the only water flowing 

[Fran Healy & Sugarbabes:]
Is the bitter sting of tears

[Fran Healy & Justin Hawkins:]
And the Christmas bells that ring there are the clanging chimes of doom

[Bono:]
Well tonight thank God it's them instead of you

[Will Young & Jamelia:]
And there won't be snow in Africa this Christmastime
The greatest gift they'll get this year is life

[Ms Dynamite & Beverly Knight:]
Where nothing ever grows
No rain nor rivers flow

[Group of ten and Joss Stone:]
Do they know it's Christmastime at all?

[Tom Chaplin (Keane):]
Here's to you

[Justin Hawkins (Darkness):]
Raise a glass for everyone

[Dizzee Rascal:]
Spare a thought this yuletide for the deprived
If the table was turned would you survive

[Busted:]
Here's to them

[Justin Hawkins (Darkness):]
Underneath that burning sun

[Dizzee Rascal:]
You ain't gotta feel guilt just selfless
Give a little help to the helpless

[Joss Stone & Justin Hawkins:]
Do they know it's Christmastime at all?

[Tom Chaplin:]
Feed the world

[Tom Chaplin & Chris Martin:]
Feed the world

[Tom Chaplin & Chris Martin & Sugababes:]
Feed the world 

[Tom Chaplin & Chris Martin & Sugababes:]
Feed the world

[Everyone in full chorus line.]
Feed the world 
Let them know it's Christmastime again - [repeated]

[Group of ten:]
Feed the world 

[Everyone in full chorus line.]
Feed the world - [repeated to end]

[Joss Stone ]
[Ad libs over outro]
                        
                    |
