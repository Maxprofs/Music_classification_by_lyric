                        You should be gone beast
 Be gone from me
 Be gone from my mind at least
 Let a little lady be I don't want you to want me
 Wouldn't want you to know
 I don't care where you gone beast
 I care you go Take the night off
 Be bad for me
 Take it right off and
 Be bad for me You're a night bird early riser
 You have the kind of wing
 To take her and surprise her I didn't understand where you had gone
 Didn't know you'd be right back
 I didn't hear the night song
 Calling for you into the black Take the night off and
 Be bad for me Didn't ask you to save me
 Not when you knew me well
 Wouldn't ask you even to behave
 for me
 I know there's no helping hell Take the night off and
 Be bad for me
 Take it right off and
 Be bad for me
