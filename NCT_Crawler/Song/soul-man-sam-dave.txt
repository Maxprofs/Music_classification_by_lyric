                        Coming to you on a dusty road
 Good loving, I got a truck load
 And when you get it, you got something
 Don't worry, 'cause I'm coming I'm a soul man
 I'm a soul man
 I'm a soul man (come on!)
 I'm a soul man And that ain't all Got what I got the hard way
 And I make it better, each and every day
 So honey, said don't you fret
 'Cause you ain't seen nothing yet I'm a soul man
 I'm a soul man
 I'm a soul man
 I'm a soul man, oh I was brought up on a side street, yes mam
 I learned how to love before I could eat
 I was educated at woodstock
 When I start loving, oh I can't stop I'm a soul man
 I'm a soul man
 I'm a soul man (yeah!)
 I'm a soul man Just grab the rope and I'll pull you in
 Give you hope and be your only boyfriend
 Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah (yeah!) I'm talking about a soul man
 I'm a soul man
 (And you're a) soul man
 Soul man (oh lord)
 Soul man
 (I'm a) soul man
 (And you're a) soul man
 (And you're a) soul man
