                        Hey sucka nigga
 Where ever you are
 I thought about ya fool
 While I was driving my car I wonder if you fools
 Realize how far
 You are
 You're no where in my rear mirror Your last *** ain't better
 Than my first ***
 Your best ***
 Ain't better than my worst *** The truth in my verses
 Versus
 Your metaphors
 About what your net worth is, ha ha ha ha ha
