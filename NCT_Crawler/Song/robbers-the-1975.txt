                        She had a face straight outta magazine
 God only knows but you'll never leave her
 Her balaclava is starting to chafe
 When she gets his gun he's begging, "Babe stay, stay, stay, stay, stay" I'll give him one more time
 We'll give you one more fight
 Said one more lie
 Will I know you Now if you never shoot, you'll never know
 And if you never eat, you'll never grow
 You've got a pretty kinda dirty face
 When she's leaving your home she's begging you, "Stay, stay, stay, stay, stay." I'll give you one more time
 We'll give you one more fight
 Just said one more line
 There'll be a riot, 'cause I know you Well, now that you've got your gun
 It's much harder now the police have come
 Now shoot him if it's what you're worth
 But if you just take off your mask
 To find out that everything's gone wrong, wrong, wrong. Now everybody's dead
 And they're driving past my old school
 And he's got his gun, he's got his suit on
 She says, "Babe, you look so cold, you look so cold, you look so cold
 You look so cold, you look so cold, you look so cold"
