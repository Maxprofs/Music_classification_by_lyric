                        Bài hát: We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together (Live) - 365, Isaac (365)

I remember when we broke up the first time
Saying, this is it, I’ve had enough, it looks like
We hadn’t seen each other in a month
When you said you needed space, what?

Then you come around again and say, “Baby,
I miss you and I swear I’m gonna change, trust me.”
Remember how that lasted for a day?
I say I hate you, we break up, you call me, I love you

OoOOoooh, we called it off again last night for goOoOod
This time I am telling you, I’m telling you
We are never, ever, ever, getting back together
We (WHEE!) are never, ever, ever, getting back together
You go talk to your friends talk to my friends talk to me
But we (WHEE!) are never, ever, ever, getting back together

Like Ever

I’m really gonna miss you picking fights and me
Falling for it, screaming that I’m right and you
Hide away and find your peace of mind
With some indie record that’s much cooler than mine

OoOOoooh, you called it off again tonight but oOOoooh,
This time I, am telling you, I’m telling you
We are never, ever, ever, getting back together
We (WHEE!) are never, ever, ever, getting back together
You go talk to your friends talk to my friends talk to me
But we (WHEE!) are never, ever, ever, getting back together

I used to think, that we, were forever ever ever
And I used to say never say never
Huh, he calls me up and he's like, I still love you
And i'm like, I mean, I mean this is exhausting, you know
We are never getting back together, like ever

We are never, ever, ever, getting back together
We (WHEE!) are never, ever, ever, getting back together
You go talk to your friends talk to my friends talk to me
But we (WHEE!) are never, ever, ever, getting back together

We are never, ever, ever, getting back together
We (WHEE!) are never, ever, ever, getting back together
You go talk to your friends talk to my friends talk to me
But we (WHEE!) are never, ever, ever, ever getting back together
                        
                    |
