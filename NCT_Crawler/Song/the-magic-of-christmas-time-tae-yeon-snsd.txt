                        Bài hát: The Magic Of Christmas Time - Tae Yeon (SNSD)

Tonight while the world
Is sleeping
And all of the children
Are dreaming
Snowflakes will softly be bringing
The Magic of Christmas Time

Red cotton stockings all lined up
Tinsel and lights on the tree top
Everywhere it’s all around us
The Magic of Christmas Time

Angels on high hear them calling
Wishes like stardust are falling
Hold on hold tight
To The Magic of Christmas Time

Downstairs the fire is swaying
To songs about reindeer
And sleighing
Old holiday records are playing
The Magic of Christmas Time

This time of year brings
Laughter and love
When all of the celebration
Is done
In our hearts it lives on
It can last all year long

Angels on high hear them calling
Wishes like stardust are falling
Hold on hold tight
To The Magic of Christmas Time

Come and rejoice for the night is
Alive with the spirit of kindness
If you believe you will find it
The Magic of Christmas Time
Yes if you believe
You will find it
The Magic of Christmas Time
