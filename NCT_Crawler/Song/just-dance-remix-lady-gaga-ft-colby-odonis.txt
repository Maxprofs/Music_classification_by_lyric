                        A red one 
Convict 
Gaga 

I've had a little bit too much 
All of the people start to rush
(Start to rush by)

A dizzy twister dance 
Can't find my drink or man
Where are my keys, I lost my phone

What's going on on the floor? 
I love this record baby
But I can’t see straight anymore
Keep it cool, what's the name of this club? 
I can't remember but it's alright, alright

Just dance, gonna be okay
Da-doo-doo-doo 
Just dance, spin that record babe 
Da-doo-doo-doo 
Just dance, gonna be okay
Duh-duh-duh-duh 
Dance, dance, dance
Ju-ju-ju-just dance

Wish I could shut my playboy mouth
How'd I turn my shirt inside out? 
(Inside out right)

Control your poison babe 
Roses with thorns they say
And we're all gettin' hosed tonight

What's going on on the floor? 
I love this record baby
But I can’t see straight anymore
Keep it cool, what's the name of this club? 
I can't remember but it's alright, alright

Just dance, gonna be okay
Da-doo-doo-doo 
Just dance, spin that record babe 
Da-doo-doo-doo 
Just dance, gonna be okay
Duh-duh-duh-duh 
Dance, dance, dance
Ju-ju-ju-just dance

When I come through on the dance floor checkin' out that catalogue
Can’t believe my eyes so many women without a flaw
And I ain’t gonn' give it up, steady tryna pick it up like the car 
I'mma hit it, I'mma hit it and flex until the 'til done until tomorr' yeah

Show me I can see that you got so much energy 
The way you twirling up them hips round and round 
There’s no reason, I know why you can’t leave here with me 
In the meantime stand, let me watch you break it down

Just dance, gonna be okay
Da-doo-doo-doo 
Just dance, spin that record babe 
Da-doo-doo-doo 
Just dance, gonna be okay
Duh-duh-duh-duh 
Dance, dance, dance
Ju-ju-ju-just dance

I’m psychotic sync hypnotic 
I got my blue burners and phonic 
I’m psychotic sync hypnotic 
I got my brand electronic 
I’m psychotic sync hypnotic 
I got my blue burners and phonic 
I’m psychotic sync hypnotic 
I got my brand electronic 

Go, use your muscle comin' out work it hustle 
I got it, just stay close enough to get it 
Go slow, drive it, clean it
Like so clean it’s been molesto
I got it, and your popped coll'

Just dance, gonna be okay
Da-doo-doo-doo 
Just dance, spin that record babe 
Da-doo-doo-doo 
Just dance, gonna be okay
Duh-duh-duh-duh 
Dance, dance, dance
Ju-ju-ju-just dance
