                        Don't say it's over when you say goodbye.
You think it's easy to break her heart.
But don't forget the thousands tears I cry ,
Love games on you it from the start

Love is the name of the game, don't stop!
Let me feel it again this love,
You're a part of my heart, don't leave me longing the heat of the night,
ah... Love is the name of the game, don't stop!
Will you feel it the same, my love.
I'm living just for you,
Please make my dreams come true.

This time I change it, boy, why can't you sing,
now it's the time to say the truth.
Boy, it's a joke when you say "stay with me",
Don't bring me down, don't make me blue

Love is the name of the game, don't stop!
Let me feel it again this love,
You are part of my heart, don't leave me longing the heat of the night,
ah... Love is the name of the game, don't stop!
Will you feel it the same, my love.
I'm living just for you,
please make my dreams come true.

You think it's easy when you say goodbye,
But don't forget the tears I cry
Love is the name of the game, don't stop!
Let me feel it again this love,
You're a part of my heart, don't leave me longing in the heat of the night,
ah... Love is the name of the game, don't stop!
Will you feel it the same, my love.
I'm living just for you, please make my dreams come true.

Love is the name the game, don't stop!..
