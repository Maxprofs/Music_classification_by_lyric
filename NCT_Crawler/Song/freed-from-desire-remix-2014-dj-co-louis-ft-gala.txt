My love has got no money
He's got his strong believs
My love has got no power
He's got his strong believs

My love has got no fame
He's got his strong believs
My love has got no money
He's got his strong believs

Want more and more
People just want more and more
Freedom and love
What he's looking for

Want more and more
People just want more and more
Freedom and love
What he's looking for

Freed from desire
Mind and senses purified
Freed from desire
Mind and senses purified

Freed from desire
Mind and senses purified
Freed from desire
