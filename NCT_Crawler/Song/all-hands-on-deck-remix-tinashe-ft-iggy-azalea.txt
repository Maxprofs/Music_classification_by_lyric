                        Bài hát: All Hands On Deck Remix - Tinashe ft. Iggy Azalea

All hands on deck
All in front all in the back just like that, like that
I'mma blow your mind take it out on the floor like that, like that
All in the front all in the back just like that, like that
I'mma blow your mind like that

Wasted heart
When you left me, you left me with no choice
I'm looking for a boy to fill this empty void
Kiss the old me goodbye she's dead and gone, dead and gone, oh
Wasted hard
You took the last bit of love I've ever had
You took a good girl and you turned me oh so bad
Kiss the old me goodbye she's dead and gone, dead and gone, oh

All hands on deck
All in front all in the back just like that, like that
I'mma blow your mind take it out on the floor like that, like that
All in the front all in the back just like that, like that
I'mma blow your mind like that



All hands on deck
All in front all in the back just like that, like that
I'mma blow your mind take it out on the floor like that, like that
All in the front all in the back just like that, like that
I'mma blow your mind like that

Wasted hard
Done this to death, do us apart
I watch you fold like a house of cards
Kiss the old me goodbye she's dead and gone, dead and gone, dead and gone
One by one, I watch you fall down, watch you fall like dominoes
Take no prisoners, search and destroy
Baby look at what you've done
One by one, I watch 'em go down, watch 'em fall like dominoes
Watch 'em go down, watch 'em go down, watch 'em go down

All hands on deck
All in front all in the back just like that, like that
I'mma blow your mind take it out on the floor like that, like that
All in the front all in the back just like that, like that
I'mma blow your mind like that

[Iggy Azalea]
Iggz
Every night another city different time zone
All I wanna do is get my shine on
Come and do an Iggy get your mind blown
New coupe, no roof, got the mind gone
Shitting on your evil when I play polite
This sailor round sneakers now I weat at night
I did it all, seen it all twice
Now I gotta get the money
Early morning, late night
Pulled up in a S class
Leave in a wraith, murder mommy in designer
Note the murder be the case
Tell a million bitches go and simmer down
I'mma get the paper bout as quick as word get around
Posters of me in your hubby house

Once you're getting, I been had it and the one in out
Throwing fleshing, and it's repping
I'm who running now
Walk through, cussing [?]

[Tinashe]
And you know that I tried
Really gave my all
Everything we built
Baby you let it fall, you let it fall
And now you want me
Want me back now
And the thing that's so funny
Cause baby I'm long gone, I'm long gone

All hands on deck
All in front all in the back just like that, like that
I'mma blow your mind take it out on the floor like that, like that
All in the front all in the back just like that, like that
I'mma blow your mind like that

All hands on deck
All in front all in the back just like that, like that
I'mma blow your mind take it out on the floor like that, like that
All in the front all in the back just like that, like that
I'mma blow your mind like that
