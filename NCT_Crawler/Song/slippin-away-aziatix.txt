                        Slippin' Away - AZIATIX

I don't want you to go even if you're tellin' me
You've gotten over me girl
Cuz lately I realized without you
I can't live another day

So do we try to make this work, or do we part ways?
Cuz as much as it hurts, what we have's worth all the pain flowing through
the blood in my veins
And it's still not enough, feel the melody of love through the beat of my
heart
We can never be apart, from the lands to the seas, to the stars, wherever
you are

Girl ~ just hear me out, cuz I got somethin' to say
You hear me callin' but still walkin' away
This pain inside just won't go away
Babe I can't watch you slippin' away

Dark Man X, I'm slipping
Grip on my heart, tapped out from submission
Better provision is what her heart's wishing
But she don't seem to understand my position
I admit, I don't have what it takes
To serve and provide what she wants on her plate
So I put her in place, then I'm closing the gates
Locking the chains, no intention to wait, wait

Should've treated you better
Had I known from the start
There'd be distance between us
I would have kept us from growin' apart
And I apologize
I'd do whatever that it takes girl
If I can keep you from goin' away

Girl just hear me out, cuz I got somethin' to say
You hear me callin' but still walkin' away
This pain inside just won't go away
Babe I can't watch you slippin' away

Girl did you really get over me
I won't find another ‘nother
Cuz I need you here close to me,
My one and only lover lover
What I gotta do for you to stay
My heart beats for you night and day
Fallen astray the day you've gone away, girl

Girl just hear me out, cuz I got somethin' to say
You hear me callin' but still walkin' away
This pain inside just won't go away
Babe I can't watch you slippin' away

Girl did you really get over me
I won't find another ‘nother
Cuz I need you here close to me,
My one and only lover lover

I don't want you to go even if you're tellin' me
You've gotten over me girl
