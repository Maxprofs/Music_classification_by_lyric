                        Bài hát: Merry, Merry Christmas - New Kids on the Block

Peace to the world from the
 New Kids On The Block, we are here
 Were spreading all our joy
 Spreading all our love and our cheers Cheerful sleigh bells ring
 Choir children sing
 Its peace and love
 And harmony we bring Hail, Merry Christmas, Merry, Merry Christmas
 To all our sisters and brothers
 Hail, Merry Christmas, Merry, Merry Christmas
 Let all of the world join our hands Theres a feeling in the air
 Its beginning to look like Christmas everywhere
 Hear the gentle sounds of the
 Snowflakes trickle down without a care People stop and stare
 The Christmas tree is there
 A star on top which
 Nothing cant compare Hail, Merry Christmas, Merry, Merry Christmas
 Its all about peace and understanding
 Hail, Merry Christmas, Merry, Merry Christmas
 Let all of the world lend a hand A time for me, a time for you
 Theres enough of love
 To last our whole life through
 Hail, Merry
