                        Bài hát: No More Sad Songs - Little Mix

I keep trying, nothing's working
I still wanna know, If you're alone
I keep trying to put this behind me
I still wanna know, who's taking you home

For tonight I'm going to get my mind off it
Don't care that someone's got his hands all over my body
Stay out all night
Go where the music is loud, so I don't have to think about it
I'm beggin' please don't play

No more! Sad songs
No more! Sad songs
No more! Sad songs
I'm beggin' please don't play
No more! Sad songs
No more! Sad songs
No more! Sad songs
I'm beggin' please don't play no more sad songs

Dancing with danger, talking to stangers
Don't care where I go, just can't be alone
They'll never know me, like you used to know me, no

For tonight I'm going to get my mind off it
Don't care that someone's got his hands all over my body
Stay out all night
Go where the music is loud, so I don't have to think about it
I'm beggin' please don't play

No more! Sad songs
No more! Sad songs
No more! Sad songs
I'm beggin' please don't play
No more! Sad songs
No more! Sad songs
No more! Sad songs
I'm beggin' please don't play no more sad songs

Going home take the long way round
Lights pass sit back with the windows down
I still got you on my mind
Starting to realize, not matter what I do
I will only hurt myself, tryna hurt you
And if I turn the music loud, just to drown you out
I'm beggin' please don't play

No more! Sad songs
No more! Sad songs
No more! Sad songs
I'm beggin' please don't play
No more! Sad songs
No more! Sad songs
No more! Sad songs
I'm beggin' please don't play no more sad songs
