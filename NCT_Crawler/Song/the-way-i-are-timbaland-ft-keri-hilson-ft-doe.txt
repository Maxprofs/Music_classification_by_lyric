But together we could be the perfect soulmates

[Bridge 1: Keri Hilson]
(Oh) Baby, it's alright now, you ain't gotta flaunt for me
If we go and touch, you can still touch my love, it's free
We can work without the perks just you and me
Work it out 'til we get it right

[Chorus: Keri Hilson & (D.O.E)]
Baby if you strip, you can get a tip
'Cause I like you just the way you are

Let me see ya strip, you can get a tip
'Cause I like, I like, I like...

[Verse 3: Timbaland]

It don't matter 'cause I'm the one that loves you best
Talk to me girl

[Bridge 2: Keri Hilson]
Oh, baby, it's alright now, you ain't gotta flaunt for me

Work it out 'til we get it right

[Chorus: Keri Hilson & (D.O.E)]
Baby if you strip, you can get a tip

'Cause I like you just the way you are

[Verse 4: D.O.E.]
