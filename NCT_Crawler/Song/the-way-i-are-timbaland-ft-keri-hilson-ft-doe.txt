I ain't got no money
I ain't got no car to take you on a date
I can't even buy you flowers
But together we can be the perfect soul mates
Talk to me girl

Baby, it's alright, now you ain't gotta floss for me
If we go there, you can still touch my love, it's free
We can work without the perks, just you and me
Thug it out 'til we get it right

Baby if you strip, you could get a tip
'Cause I like you just the way you are
I'm about to strip and I want it quick
Can you handle me the way I are?

I don't need the cheese or the car keys
Boy I like you just the way you are
And let me see ya strip, you could get a tip
'Cause I like

I ain't got no Visa
I ain't got no Red American Express
We can't go nowhere exotic
It don't matter 'cause I'm the one that loves you best
Talk to me girl

Baby, it's alright, now you ain't gotta floss for me

If we go there, you can still touch my love, it's free
We can work without the perks, just you and me
Thug it out 'til we get it right

Baby if you strip, you could get a tip
'Cause I like you just the way you are
I'm about to strip and I want it quick
Can you handle me the way I are?

I don't need the cheese or the car keys
Boy I like you just the way you are
And let me see ya strip, you could get a tip
'Cause I like you just the way you are

Baby girl
I don't got a huge ol' house
I rent a room in a house
Listen baby girl
I ain't got a motorboat but I can float ya boat

So listen baby girl
Once you get a dose of D.O.E.
You gon' want some mo'
So listen baby girl
When I make it I want you back
Want you back, yeah
