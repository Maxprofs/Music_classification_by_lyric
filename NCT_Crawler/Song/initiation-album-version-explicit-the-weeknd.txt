                        Oh yeah
 Got you drinking out them white cups so what
 All this *** sounds foreign to you, thick smoke, choking
 Baby get familiar with the order
 Just crack it, then pour it, then sip slow, then tip low
 My eyes red but my brim low, that xo, she climbing
 Straight to the top, forget why she there in the first place
 No more crying, heart rate slow, put that rum down you don't wanna die tonight
 I promise, when you're finished we'll head to where I'm living
 The party won't finish it's a *** celebration

 For my niggas out tonight, and they high off Shakespeare lines
 There's enough to pass around, you ain't gotta wait in line
 And the clocks don't work you ain't gotta check the time
 And the blinds don't work you ain't gotta check the sky
 We be going all night, til light

 I got a test for you
 You say you want my heart
 Well baby you can have it all
 There's just something I need from you
 Is to meet my boys

 You've been going hard baby, now you rolling with some big boys baby
 Got a lot you wanna show off baby, close that door before you take your *** clothes off baby
 Don't mind, all my writings on the wall
 Thought I passed my peak, and I'm experiencing fall
 And all I wanna do is leave cause I've been zoning for a week
 And I ain't left this little room, trying to concentrate to breathe
 Cuz this piff so potent, kill a seratonin
 In that two floor loft in the middle we be choking
 On that all black voodoo, got me gum chewing
 Call one of your best friends
 Baby if you mixing up
 Cup of that xo, baby I been leaning
 Back from the come down, girl I been fiending
 For another round, don't you blame it on me
 When you're grinding up them teeth and it's *** hard to sleep

 I got a test for you
 You say you want my heart
 Well baby you can have it all
 There's just something I need from you
 Is to meet my boys
 I got a lot of boys
 And we can make you right
 And if you get too high
 Baby come over here and ride it out, ride it out

 Work that back til I turn you out
 Roll that weed, blow the fire out
 Taste that lean when you kiss my mouth
 Get so wet when I eat you out
 Girlfriend screaming that I'm creeping out
 Been knocked out, I keep em out
 Ex-man hollering, keep him out
 Hard to let go, I could teach you how
 Take a puff of this mother*** weed for now
 Take a shot of this cognac, ease you out
 Just one night, trying to *** leave you out
 Baby, baby

 I got a test for you
 You say you want my heart
 Well baby you can have it all
 There's just something I need from you
 Is to meet my boys
 I got a lot of boys
 And we can make you right
 And if you get too high
 Baby come over here and ride it out, ooh yeah, ooh yeah, ooh yeah
 Baby come over here and ride it out, ooh yeah, ooh yeah, ooh yeah

 That north north, that up top, that ovo and that xo, (x8)
