 We ain't doing much
 Tryna have a good time

 Aye get *** up Four bad bitches
 Man the pleasure all mine
 We ain't doin' nothing
 Tryin' to have a good time
 Roll around the city, porsche seats on recline
 Four Bad bitches
 Fuckin' 'em at the same time
 Bitch named keisha, got an ass like a bubble
 Feed her M&M's watch it turn to some trouble
 Two hands on the ball, shorty just double
 Once I get mine
 Aye ain't trying to cuddle
 All in the party
 Hippy trippy on the henny
 Jar full of weed
 Baby girl I got plenty
 Break fast for the chick
 Like I work at Denny's
 Shawty where the shots
 Aye need many, many, many, many
 Molly in the system
 Drinkin' out the bottle
 Shorty goin' in
 Going hard full throttle
 Instagram likes got her feeling like a model
 If you looking' for the drugs, don't worry I got 'em Aye get *** up

 Molly got her ass wide awake no Folgers
 Aye what it is Diego bring the doja
 One more shot I'm in that hole like a gofer
 Smoke, smoke, smoke
 Drink, drink, drink
 Bitch I'm getting money
 Give a damn what you think
 One more shot, hella bent, might faint
 Super lit hit it ho
 Going hard in the paint
 Fruit rolling up he ain't ran out of yet
 Boutta take off, my migos offset
 Rolled up the blunt, got a dutch full of Shreks
 Said that she want more
 Guess she ain't done yet
 Green green green
 Mean mean mean
 Bad bitch kissin'
 I ain't tryin' to intervene
 If you gone do it
 Baby do it for the team
 And it's on blowing strong
 Money long, limousine Drink a little bit
