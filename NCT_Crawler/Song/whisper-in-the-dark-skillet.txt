                        Despite the lies that you're making
Your love is mine for the taking
My love is
Just waiting
To turn your tears to roses
I will be the one that's goona hold you
I will be the one that you run to
My love is 
A burning
Consuming fire
Nooooooooo
You'll never be alone
When darkness comes, I'll light the night with stars
Hear my whispers in the dark
Nooooooooo
You'll never be alone
When darkness comes you know i'm never far
Hear my whispers in the dark
Whispers in the dark
You feel so lonely and ragged
You lay there broken and naked
My love is
Just waiting
To clothe you in crimson roses
I will be the one that's gonna find you
I will be the one that's gonna guide you
My love is 
A burning
Consuming fire
Nooooooooo
You'll never be alone
When darkness comes, I'll light the night with stars
Hear my whispers in the dark
Nooooooooo
You'll never be alone
When darkness comes you know i'm never far
Hear my whispers in the dark
Whispers in the dark
Nooooooooo
You'll never be alone
When darkness comes, I'll light the night with stars
Hear my whispers in the dark
Nooooooooo
You'll never be alone
When darkness comes you know i'm never far
Hear my whispers in the dark
whispers in the dark
Whispers in the dark
