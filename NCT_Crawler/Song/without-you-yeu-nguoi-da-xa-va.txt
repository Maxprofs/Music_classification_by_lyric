                        Bài hát: Without You (Yêu Người Đã Xa) - V.A

I can't go on without your love
You know I just can't do without you
What would I do without your love
Don't you know you mean the world to me
I remember all my days without you
Oh love I don't know how I got through on my own
I remember all my days without you
How I sat through the night waiting by the phone
Just waiting here all alone
But you'll never home

I don't wanna be here all alone
I don't wanna be without your love
Please don't leave me now
Please don't tell me down
Can you give our love one more chance
Just one more try 

I can't go on without your love
You know I just can't do without you
What would I do without your love
Don't you know you mean the world to me
I remember all my days without you
Oh love I don't know how I got through on my own
I remember all my days without you
How I sat through the night waiting by the phone
Just waiting here all alone
But you'll never home

I don't wanna be here all alone
I don't wanna be without your love
Please don't leave me now
Please don't tell me down
Can you give our love one more chance
Just one more try 

I don't wanna be here all alone
I don't wanna be without your love
Please don't leave me now
Please don't tell me down
Can you give our love one more chance
Just one more try 

I don't wanna be here all alone
I don't wanna be without your love
Please don't leave me now
Please don't tell me down
Can you give our love one more chance
Just one more try
