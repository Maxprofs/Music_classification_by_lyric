                        Song: Sixteen Going On Seventeen - Charmian Carr, Dan Truhitte

You wait, little girl, on an empty stage
For fate to turn the light on
Your life, little girl, is an empty page
That men wil want to write on
To write on
You are sixteen going on seveteen
Baby its time to think
Better beware, be canny and careful
Baby, you're on the brink
You are sixteen going on seventeen
Fellows will fall in line
Eager young lads and rogues and cads will offer you food and wine
Totally unprepared are you
To face a world of men
Timid and shy and scared are you
Of things beyond your ken
You need someone older and wiser
Telling you what to do
I am seventeen going on eighteen
I'll take care of you
I am sixteen going on seventeen
I know that I'm naive
Fellows I meet may tell me I'm sweet
And willingly I believe
I am sixteen going on seventeen
Innocent as a rose
Bachelor dandies, drinkers of brandies
What do I know of those
Totally unprepared am I To face a world of men
Timid and shy and scared am I
Of things beyond my ken
I need someone older and wiser telling me what to do
You are seventeen going on eighteen
I'll depend on you
                        
                    |
