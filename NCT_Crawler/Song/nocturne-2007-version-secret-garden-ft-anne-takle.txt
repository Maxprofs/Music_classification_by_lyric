                        Nocturne

Now, let the day
Just fade away
So the dark night 
may watch over you

Velvet, blue
Silent, true
It embraces your heart 
and your soul
Nocturne

Never cry never sigh
You don't have to wonder why
Always be always see
Come and dream the night with me
Nocturne

Have no fear
When the night draws near
And fills you 
with dreams and desire

Like a child asleep
So warm, so deep
You will find me there 
waiting for you
Nocturne

We will fly claim the sky
We don't have to wonder why
Always see always be
Come and dream the night with me
Nocturne

Though darkness lay
It will give away
When the dark night 
delivers the day
Nocturne
