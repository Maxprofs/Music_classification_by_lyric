                        You tuck me in,
Turn out the light
kept me safe and sound at night
little girls depend on things like that

Brush my teeth and comb my hair
had to drive me everywhere
you were always there when I looked back

You had to do it all alone
Make a living, make a home
Must have been as hard as it could be

And when I couldn't sleep at night
Scare things wouldn't turn out right
you would hold my hand and sing to me

Caterpillar in the tree, how you wonder who you'll be
can't go far but you can always dream
Wish you may and wish you might
don't you worry hold on tight.
I promise you there will come a day
Butterfly Fly Away
Butterfly Fly Away (butterfly fly away)

Flap your wing now you cant stay
Take those dreams and make them all come true
Butterfly Fly Away (butterfly fly away)
We've been waiting for this day
All along and know just what to do
Butterfly,
Butterfly,
Butterfly,
Butterfly Fly Away

(Butterfly Fly Away)
