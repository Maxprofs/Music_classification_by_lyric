                        Bài hát: Ain't My Fault - Zara Larsson

[Intro] 
Oh my, oh my, oh my 
Oh my, oh my, oh my 
Oh my, oh my, oh my, oh my 

[Verse 1] 
It ain't my fault you keep turning me on 
It ain't my fault you got, got me so gone 
It ain't my fault I'm not leaving alone 
It ain't my fault you keep turning me on 

I can't talk right now, I'm looking and I like what I'm seeing 
Got me feeling kinda shocked right now 
Could've stopped right now, even if I wanted 
Gotta get it, get it, get it, while it's hot right now 
Oh my god, what is this 
Why you all in my business 
Baby I insist, please don't blame me for what ever happens next 

[Pre-Chorus] 
No I, can't be responsible 
If I, get you in trouble now 
See you're, too irresistible 
Yeah that's for sure 

[Chorus] 
So if I put your hands where my eyes can't see 
Then you're the one who's got a hold on me 
No I can't be responsible, responsible 
It ain't my fault 

It ain't my fault (no, no, no, no) 
It ain't my fault (no, no, no, no) 

[Verse 2] 
It ain't my fault you came here looking like that 
You just made me trip, fall, and land on your lap 
Certain bad boy swoon, body hotter than a sun 
I don't mean to be rude, but I look so damn good on ya 

Ain't got time right now, missed me with [?] 
It's out of time, I just called an Uber and it's right outside 
Oh my god, what is this 
Why you all in my business 
Baby I insist, please don't blame me for what ever happens next 

[Pre-Chorus] 
No I, can't be responsible 
If I, get you in trouble now 
See you're, too irresistible 
Yeah that's for sure 

[Chorus] 
So if I put your hands where my eyes can't see 
Then you're the one who's got a hold on me 
No I can't be responsible, responsible 
It ain't my fault 

It ain't my fault (no, no, no, no) 
It ain't my fault (no, no, no, no) 

[Bridge] 
Baby one, two, three 
Your body's calling me 
And I know wherever it is 
Is exactly where I wanna be 
But don't blame me 
It ain't my fault 

It ain't my fault (no, no, no, no) 
It ain't my fault (no, no, no, no) 
It ain't my fault (oh my, oh my, oh my) 

[Chorus] 
So if I put your hands where my eyes can't see 
Then you're the one who's got a hold on me 
No I can't be responsible, responsible 
It ain't my fault 

It ain't my fault (no, no, no, no) 
It ain't my fault (no, no, no, no) 

[Outro] 
It ain't my fault you got me so caught 
It ain't my fault you got me so caught 
Oh, well that's too bad it ain't my fault
                        
                    |
