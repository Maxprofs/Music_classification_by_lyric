                        Bài hát: Jason’s Song (Gave It Away) - Ariana Grande

Yeah, you really tried
But I was blind to all the lies you told me, boy
All the *** you've done
You can't outrun the way you understand me

You acted like you bought me at a bargain sale
You don't even care
You focused your frustration on a small detail
Blew it out of scale, like my ponytail

Well, if you don't want to see the girl I want to be
Then why, then why should I listen?
If you don't want to do the things I need from you
Goodbye, goodbye
Cause I gave it away, I gave it away, I gave it away
And I'm taking it right back

I'm no blow up doll, no free-for-all
No slave to your decision, ooh
Gotta find a way to break the spell
To get the hell away from those who block my vision

You used me as a fragment of your grand design, hey
And you, you don't get to put me on your bottom line
You don't get what's mine, and I'm doing fine

Said you don't want to see the girl I want to be
Then why, then why would I listen?
If you don't want to do the things I need from you
Goodbye, goodbye
Cause I gave it away, I gave it away, I gave it away
I'm taking it right back, baby

Well, if you don't want to see the girl I want to be
Then why, then why should I listen?
If you don't want to do the things I need from you
Goodbye, goodbye
Cause I gave it away, I gave it away, I gave it away, I gave it away
And I'm taking it right back, hey
Taking it right back, baby
I'm taking it right back, hey
