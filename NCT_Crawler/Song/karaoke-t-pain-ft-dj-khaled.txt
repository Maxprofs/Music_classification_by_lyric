                        Dear Akon forgive me for what I'm about to say
 Dear Barry Wize I know you told me
 Not to worry about it, man, but I can't let it ride
 Dear God let's make it happen I'm tryin' to be you, nigga, yeah nigga
 Watch me do me, watch me do me
 Watch me do me, watch me do me, yeah
 Nappy Boy, Nappy Boy
 DJ Khaled, aye yo Pain, I want you to go in
 DJ Khaled, let's go man, we the best listen I got up out the streets, so I ain't gotta steal
 But listen to the radio it's obvious I still kill
 But y'all was in the game way before me
 So why you wanna do some *** I did in '03? I'm layin' low key for a long time
 But don't act like you know me, this is the wrong time
 So grab ya microphone, set your auto tune and I'm a bust
 A verse on yo ass like I oughta do I ain't no gangsta dude, I ain't got a poppin' banga
 But you know I'm powerful
 When I'm pissin' off the gospel singer's
 I'm tryin' to feed my kids, y'all niggas can die slowly
 'Cause to me, it sound like a bunch of karaoke Aye yo, *** the imposter
 *** these karaoke niggas, man
 T-Pain, they wanna live your life, man
 These some bitch ass niggas, man It's the DJ Khaled, Nappy Boy
 I'm goin' in, I'm goin' in, aye yo T-pain
 I know you Khaled, I know you right now
 Let me get 'em again Listen it ain't all bad, some of ya please me
 But the only niggas that's cool is Kanye and Lil' Weezy
 I'm a hit maker, not a comedian
 So why the *** were these niggas laughin' at me
 When I seen they ass? This *** would never work, a one hit wonder bitch
 But all that *** that you doin' now make me wonder this
 Now why it's cool for you but it's not for me?
 And why he ain't hop on my song and make it hot for me? But you don't give a ***, you just a swagger jacker
 Now I'm a certified Lamborghinist and Cadillacer
 'Cause I'm tryna feed my kids, y'all niggas can die slowly
 'Cause just to me it sound like a bunch of karaoke Y'all singin' the same old song, y'all some karaoke niggas
 Karaoke *** niggas, this is Nappy Boy
 This is DJ Khaled, We Global with this hood ***
 This what we do, why you wanna live our life?
 You wanna live our lifestyle, aye yo T-Pain
 Waddup Khaled, get them Let me get a moment of silence for the late great Roger Troutman
 Ya'll niggas ain't holdin' it down, so we had to put me at ya
 Bitch, I'm Teddy Pain, the son of Teddy Riley
 The father of the game, you bustin' niggas wildin' How many niggas really wanna test?
