Don't worry about a thing
'Cause every little thing gonna be alright
Singin', don't worry about a thing
'Cause every little thing gonna be alright

Rise up this morning, smile with the rising sun
Three little birds pitch by my doorstep
Singin' sweet songs of melodies pure and true
Sayin', this is my message to you

Singin', don't worry about a thing
'Cause every little thing is gonna be alright
Singin', don't worry about a thing
'Cause every little thing gonna be alright

Rise up this morning, smile with the rising sun
Three little birds pitch by my doorstep
Singin' sweet songs of melodies pure and true
Sayin', this is my message to you

Singin', don't worry about a thing
'Cause every little thing is gonna be alright
Singin', don't worry about a thing
'Cause every little thing gonna be alright

Singin', don't worry about a thing
'Cause every little thing is gonna be alright
Singin', don't worry about a thing
'Cause every little thing gonna be alright

Singin', don't worry about a thing
'Cause every little thing is gonna be alright
