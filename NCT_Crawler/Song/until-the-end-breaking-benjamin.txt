                        So clever, whatever, I'm done with these endeavors
 Alone I'll walk the winding way, here I stay
 It's over, no longer I feel it growing stronger
 I live to die another day, until I fade away Why give up? Why give in? It's not enough, it never is
 So I will go on until the end
 We've become desolate, it's not enough, it never is
 But I will go on until the end Surround me, it's easy to fall apart completely
 I feel you creeping up again in my head
 It's over, no longer I feel it growing colder
 I knew this day would come to end, so let this life begin Why give up? Why give in? It's not enough, it never is
 So I will go on until the end
 We've become desolate, it's not enough, it never is
 But I will go until the end I've lost the way, I've lost the way
 But I will go on until the end
 Living is hard enough without you *** up Why give up? Why give in? It's not enough, it never is
 So I will go on until the end
 We've become desolate, it's not enough, it never is
 But I will go on until the end I've lost the way, I've lost the way
 But I will go on until the end The final fight, I win
 The final fight, I win
 The final fight, I win
 But I will go on until the end
