                        Take a journey back in time
 Leave the western world behind
 Cross the mountains to peking
 Where the paper laterns gently swing

 The chinese way
 Who knows what they know
 The chinese legend grows

 My eyes wide open
 I feel a breeze
 Words softly spoken
 In cantonese

 Standing at the master's side
 The with patience he confides
 Secret knowledge - sacred ways
 Paerls of wisdom from the dragon days

 I could never lie
 For honour I would lie
 Following the chinese way

 So many years ago hero's ruled the world
 (some died for love in a cruel world)
 They were the only ones in a cruel world

 I could never lie
 For honour I would lie
 Following the chinese way

 From the mountains to peking
 Where the paper laterns gently swing

 The chinese way
 Who knows what they know
 The chinese legend grows
                        
                    |
