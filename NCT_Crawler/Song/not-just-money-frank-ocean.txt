                        Stop thinking of this as being money
 It's just money, I'mma make more
 Please decondition yourself
 It's the difference between happy, being happy and sad
 It's the difference between having a home and living on the streets
 That's what it is, it's not just money
 It's so much more than that
 Right now it's the difference between you being able to go to a prom
 And disappointing a girl
 As I told you from the beginning, I don't have money
 I have bills to pay, but that meant nothing to you
 Ooh yeah, I'mma make myself a hot link when I get home
 It meant nothing to you
 Savin' my seven dollars
