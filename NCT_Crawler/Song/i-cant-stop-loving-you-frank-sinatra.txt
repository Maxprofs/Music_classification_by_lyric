                        I cant stop lovin' you
 So I've made up my mind
 To live, to live in memory
 Of old lonesome times I can't stop wantin' you
 It's useless to say
 So I'll just live my life
 I'll live it all in dreams of yesterday Those happy hours
 That we once knew
 Though long ago
 They make me so blue They say that time
 Heals a broken heart
 But time has stood still
 Since we've been apart Ain't no use to try
 To try to pretend
 There's someone new
 I'd been livin' a lie I can't stop wantin' you
 The way that I do
 There's only been one love for me
 That one love is you There's only been one love for me
 That one love is you
 Hear me, baby, there's been only one love for me
 That one love is you
                        
                    |
