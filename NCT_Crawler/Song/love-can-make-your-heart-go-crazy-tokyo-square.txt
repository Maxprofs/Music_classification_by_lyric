                        Bài hát: Love Can Make Your Heart Go Crazy - Tokyo Square

You say love is just a fading word 
And the world is suck a fool 
Just believing in suck a thing 
Makes your heart crazy 
You say you have really been in love before 
And your heart has broken to pieces 
You say you'll never fall in love again 
Cause that will make your heart go crazy 

Ow how i wish i can change your mind again 
And to make your heart beats for me 
Cause it's true that my heart really go for you 
And i'm really deeply in love with you 
Ow how i wish i can change your heart again 
And to play silly games with you 
Cause it's true that my heart really go for you 
And to play silly games with you 
And you'll realise that love is true 
Cause i'm really deeply in love with you
