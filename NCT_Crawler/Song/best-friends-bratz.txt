                        Put your hands up, raise your hands up
 Put up a hand for your best friends
 Put your hands up, raise your hands up
 Put up a hand for your best friends Some friends come, some friends go
 But there's no one like you
 You're the only friends I would
 Tell my secrets to We've got a special bond
 That no one can break through
 We're just like sisters
 And we stick together like glue 'Cause you know that we could read each others minds
 And we've got each others backs all the time
 So we just thought that we would let you know
 We'll be your friends for sure Best friends, 'cause they never let each other down
 We're best friends, no matter what we'll always be around
 When you need someone to talk to
 Girls, you can count on us to be your best friends When you're glad, when you're sad
 We will be right here
 Anything you go through
 Call us up and share That's what friends are for
 We will lend a ear
 Any burden that you carry
 Will be ours to bear 'Cause you know that we could read each others minds
 And we've got each others backs all the time
 So we just thought that we would let you know
 We'll be your friends for sure Best friends, 'cause they never let each other down
 We're best friends, no matter what we'll always be around
 When you need someone to talk to
 Girls, you can count on us to be your best friends Girlfriends you can count on us
 We'll be around whenever you need us
 Friends for life, yes indeed
 Got each others back permanently Put your hands up, raise your hands up
 Put up a hand for your best friends
 Put your hands up, raise your hands up
 Put up a hand for your best friends Best friends, 'cause they never let each other down
 We're best friends, no matter what we'll always be around
 When you need someone to talk to
 Girls, you can count on us to be your best friends Best friends, we're best friends
 No matter what, best friends
 Girls, you can count on us to be your best friends
