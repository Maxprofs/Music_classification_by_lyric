Âu Mỹ khác|

                        I watch the city burn
These dreams like ashes float away
Your voice I never heard
Only silence
Where were you when our hearts were bleeding
Where were you when it all crashed down
Never thought that you'd deceive me
Where are you now

How long can you stand the pain
How long will you hide your face
How long will you be afraid
Are you afraid
How long will you play this game
Will you fight or will you walk away
How long will you let it burn
Let it burn
Let it burn

I watch the city burn
These passions slowly smoldering
A lesson never learned
Only violence
Is your world just a broken promise
Is your love just a drop of rain
Will we all just burn our fire
Are you still there

How long can you stand the pain
How long will you hide your face
How long will you be afraid
Are you afraid
How long will you play this game
Will you fight or will you walk away
How long will you let it burn
Let it burn
Let it burn

Will you wait until it all burns down
Will you hide until it all burns down
Will it hurt when it all burns down
Will you fight when it all burns down

Will you stand when it all burns down
Will you love when it all burns down
Will it end when it all burns down
Will you just let it all burns down

How long can you stand the pain
How long will you hide your face
How long will you be afraid
Are you afraid
How long will you play this game
Will you fight or will you walk away
How long will you let it burn
Let it burn
Let it burn

Let it burn
Let it burn
Let it burn
                        
                    |
