                        Song: La La La (DEVolution Remix) - Naughty Boy

Hush, don't speak
When you spit your venom
keep it shut I hate it
When you hiss and preach
About your new messiah 
'cause your theories catch fire

I can't find those silver linings
I don't mean to judge
But when you read your speech
it's tiring
Enough is enough

I'm covering my ears like a kid
When your words mean nothing
I go la la la
I'm turning off the volume 
when you speak
Cause if my heart can't stop it
I find a way to block it
I go

I find a way to block it
I go

Yes our love is running out of time
I won't count the hours
rather be a coward
When our words collide
I'm gonna drown you out 
before I lose my mind

I can't find those silver linings
I don't mean to judge
But when you read your speech
it's tiring
Enough is enough

I'm covering my ears like a kid
When your words mean nothing
I go la la la
I'm turning off the volume 
when you speak
Cause if my heart can't stop it
I find a way to block it
I go

I find a way to block it
I go

I find a way to block you, oh

I find a way to block it
I go

I'm covering my ears like a kid
When your words mean nothing
I go la la la
I'm turning off the volume 
when you speak
Cause if my heart can't stop it
I find a way to block it
I go

I'm covering my ears like a kid
when your words mean nothing
I go la la la
I'm turning off the volume 
when you speak
Cause if my heart can't stop it
I find a way to block it
I go
