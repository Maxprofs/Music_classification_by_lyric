                        Bài hát: Beautiful People Beautiful Problems - Lana Del Rey, Stevie Nicks

[Verse 1: Lana Del Rey]
Blue is the color of the planet from the view above
Long live our reign, long live our love
Green is the planet from the eyes of a turtle dove
'Til it runs red, runs red with blood

[Pre-Chorus 1: Lana Del Rey]
We get so tired and we complain
'Bout how it's hard to live
It's more than just a video game

[Chorus: Lana Del Rey]
But we're just beautiful people
With beautiful problems, yeah
Beautiful problems, God knows we've got them
But we gotta try (lie-la-lie)
Every day and night (lie-la-lie)

[Verse 2: Stevie Nicks]
Blue is the collar of the shirt of the man I love
He's hard at work, hard to the touch
But warm is the body of the girl from the land he loves
My heart is soft, my past is rough

[Pre-Chorus 2: Lana Del Rey, both]
But when I love him, get a feeling
Something close to like a sugar rush
It runs through me, but is it wasted love?
(Let's not waste it, love)

[Chorus: Lana Del Rey, Stevie Nicks, both]
But we're just beautiful people
With beautiful problems, yeah
Beautiful problems, God knows we've got them
But we gotta try (lie-la-lie)
Every day and night (lie-la-lie)

[Bridge: Lana Del Rey, both]
Yeah we've gotta try (lie-la-lie)
We gotta walk through fire (lie-la-lie)
Because we're just

[Chorus: Lana Del Rey, both]
Beautiful people with beautiful problems, yeah
(We're just)
Beautiful problems, God knows we've got them
(Beautiful people)
Beautiful people with beautiful problems, yeah
(We're just)
Beautiful problems, God knows we got them

[Outro: Lana Del Rey & Stevie Nicks]
So beautiful
Yeah
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
