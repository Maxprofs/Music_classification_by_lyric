                        Want to, but I cant help it
I love the way it feel
Just kind of stuck between
My fantasy and what is real
I need it when I want it,
I want it when I don't
Tell myself I stop everyday knowing that I wont

I got a problem and I,
(Don't know what to do about it)
Even if I did, I don't know if I would quit,
but I doubt it I'm

Taking by the thought of it
and I know this much is true
Baby you.. have become my addiction
I'm so strung out on you
I can't barely move,
but I like it
and then it's all because of you
(all because of you..)
and then it's all because of you
(all because of you..)
and then it's all because of you
(all because of you..)
and then it's all because..

Never get enough, She's the sweetest stuff (ohh)

*Think of it every second,
I can't get nothing done
Only concern is the next time
I'm going to get me some
Know what I should stay away from
'Cause it's no good for me
I try and try, but my obsession won't let me leave

I got a problem and I
(Don't know what to do about It)
Even if I did, I don't know if I would quit,
but I doubt It I

Taking by the thought of it (heyy)
and I know this much is true
Baby you.. have become my addiction
I'm so strung out on you (strung out on you)
I can't barely move, (ohh)
but I like it (and i like it)
and then it's all because of you (ohh)
(all because of you..)
and then it's all because of you
(all because of you..)
and then it's all because of you
(all because of you..)
and then it's all because..

Never get enough (Never get enough), she's the sweetest stuff (ohh)

Ain't no doubt (no doubt..), so strung out (strung out..)
Ain't no doubt (i said it ain't no doubt), so strung out
(heyy) Over you (Over you), Over you (you..), Over you (you..)

ohh whoo ohh
Because of you and it's all because of you.
Never get enough, she's the sweetest stuff
She's the sweetest stuff
