A million miles away
Your signal in the distance
To whom it may concern
I think I lost my way
Getting good at starting over
Everytime that I return

Learning to walk again
I believe I've waited long enough
Where do I begin?
Learning to talk again
Can't you see I've waited long enough?
Where do I begin?

Do you remember the days
We built these paper mountains
Then sat and watched them burn
I think I found my place
Can't you feel it growing stronger
Little conquerors

Learning to walk again
I believe I've waited long enough
Where do I begin?
Learning to talk again
I believe I've waited long enough
Where do I begin?
Now!

For the very first time
Don't you pay no mind
Set me free, Again

To keep alive, A moment at a time
That's still insde, A whisper to a riot
The sacrifice, The knowing to survive
The first decline, Another state of mind
I'm on my knees, I'm praying for a sign
Forever, Whenever, I never wanna die!

I Never Wanna Die!
I Never Wanna Die!
I'm On My Knees, I Never Wanna Die
I'm Dancing On My Grave
I'm Running Through The Fire
Forever! Whenever!
I Never Wanna Die!
I Never Wanna Leave!
I'll Never Say Goodbye!
Forever! Whenever!
Forever! Whenever!

Learning to walk again
I believe I've waited long enough
Where do I begin?
Learning to talk again
Can't you see I've waited long enough?
Where do I begin?

Learning to walk again
I believe I've waited long enough

Learning to talk again
Can't you see I've waited long enough?
