                        Bài hát: Goodbye Christmas (English Version) - Lay (EXO)

Baby call my name if you remember tonight
We ended our time on this night
Used to be the one yes it breaks my heart
Where did you go why are you so far away
Every memory keeps bringing you back
I can't even count the sleepless nights
Yes I was wrong oh you were right
I wonder if I had listened to you one more time

I'm falling I'm falling down
Everyone's happy now but I'm alone tonight
Don't let me don't let me drown
It's so late to say I love you baby goodbye

Every memory keeps bringing me back
Don't wanna be left in this way
Yes I was wrong oh you were right
I wonder if I had listened to you one more time

I'm falling i'm falling down
Everyone's happy now but I'm alone tonight
Don't let me don't let me drown
It's so late to say I love you baby so goodbye

Freezing winter
Shining tree lights
I can't stand this ironic night
Baby don't try to make my eyes cry
I wont't let you in my mind

I'm falling I'm falling down 
Everyone's happy now but I'm alone tonight
Don't let me don't let me drown
It's so late to say I love you baby goodbye
                        
                    |
