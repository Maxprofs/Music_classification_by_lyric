                        You say you like my conversation over again
 But you don't love me
 You say I have a heart of gold and a body that you'd long to hold
 And it kills me
 You say you like my company you'll spend all my time
 But you don't love me
 And I know if I sailed a thousand seas and threw myself down on my knees
 You'd leave me

 I think maybe there's a hope in your soul
 I think maybe there's a hole in your soul

 Hold your hands or don't leave me hanging on
 Hold your hands oh don't leave me waiting on

 Courage will you come to my aid
 Oh courage will you come to my aid

 You hide a hundred implications under your skin
 And you don't love me
 You run your fingers through my hair
 And put the heart I have laid bare

 Let everybody see

 I build you in to hold my plans you open my heals
 But you don't love me
 You say you cannot help yourself
 That your emotions cannot spell
 That I can't make you feel

 I think maybe there's a hope in your soul
 I think maybe there's a hole in your soul

 Hold your hands or don't leave me hanging on
 Hold your hands oh don't leave me waiting on

 Courage will you come to my aid
 Oh courage will you come to my aid

 Courage will you come to my aid (overlapping) hold your hands or don't leave me hanging on
 Oh courage will you come to my aid (overlapping ) hold your hands oh don't leave me waiting on
                        
                    |
