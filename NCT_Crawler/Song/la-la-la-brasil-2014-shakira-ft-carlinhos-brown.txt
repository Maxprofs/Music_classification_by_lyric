                        Bài hát : La La La (Brasil 2014) - Shakira, Carlinhos Brown

Essa bola vai rolar
Mundo é um tapete verde
Quando a bola chega lá
O coração fica na rede, na rede, na rede
Olá, olá

La la la la la
La la la la la
La la la la la
La la la la la
I dare you

(Leggo, Leggo, Leggo, Leggo)

Feel how the planet's Become one
Beats like a drum To the same rhythm
Hear the whistle kick the ball
The entire world soars like an eagle

In Rio we play like we dance
Only today there's no tomorrow

Leave all behind in this place
There's no space for fear or sorrow

Is it true that you want it
Then act like you mean it
With everyone watching
It's truth or dare can you feel it

La la la la la
La la la la la
La la la la la
La la la la la
I dare you

You have arrived it's the place
No more doubts the time is coming
Feel how the planet's become one
Like a drum destiny's calling

German, Colombians, spanish and French
Off the bench you gotta own it
Down here we play like we dance
It's Brazil and now you know it

Is it true that you want it
Then act like you mean it
With everyone watching
It's truth or dare can you feel it

La la la la la
La la la la la
La la la la la
La la la la la
I dare you

Is it true that you want it
Then act like you mean it
The whole world is watching
It's truth or dare can you feel it

(Hola! Hola! hola! hola! hola! hola! hola!)

La la la la la
La la la la la
La la la la la
La la la la la
I dare you

(Leggo, Leggo, Leggo, Leggo)
