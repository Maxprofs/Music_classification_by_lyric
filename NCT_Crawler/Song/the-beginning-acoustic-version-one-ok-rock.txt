                        Just give me a reason
To keep my heart beating
Don’t worry it’s safe right here in my arms
As the world falls apart around us
All we can do is hold on, hold on

Take my hand
And bring me back

I risk everything if it’s for you
I whisper into the night
Telling me it’s not my time and don’t give up
I’ve never stood up before this time
Demo yuzurenai mono itta kono te wo hanasanai

So stand up, stand up (Just gotta keep on running)
Wake up, wake up (Just tell me how I can)
Never give up
Kuru wa shimi hodo setsunai

Just tell me why baby
They might call me crazy
For saying I’d fight until there is no more
Fureri wo fukunda senkougankou wa kankakiteki shoudou
Blinded, I can’t see the end
So where do I begin?

Say another word, I can't hear you
The silence between us
Nanimo nai you ni utsuteru dake
I take this chance that I make you mine
Tada kakusenai mono kattate yori misekakete

So stand up, stand up (Just gotta keep on running)
Wake up, wake up (Just tell me how I can)
Never give up
Kanashimi to setsunasa

Just give me a reason
To keep my heart beating
Don’t worry it’s safe right here in my arms
Kudaketenaide saite jita kono omoi wa
So blinded I can’t see the end

Look how far we made it
The pain i can’t escape it
Kono mamajya mada owarase koto wa dekinai deshou
Nando kutabarisou demo kuchi hateyou tomo owariwanaisa
So where do I begin?

Nigirishimeta ushinawanu youni to
Te wo hirogereba koboreochisou de
Ushinau mono nado nakatta hibino dasei wo sutete kimi wo

Just tell me why baby
They might call me crazy
For saying I’d fight until there is no more
Fureri ukanda senkougankou wa kangakiteki shoudou
Blinded, I can’t see the end

Look how far we made it
The pain i can’t escape it
Kono mamajya mada owaraseru koto wa dekinai deshou
Nando kutabarisou demo kuchi hateyou tomo owariwanaisa
It finally begins..
