English:
Why am I crying?
Why am I lost?
Why did I stop?
Please tell me
When will I grow up?
How long can I stay a child?
Where have I come running from?
Where am I running to?
I had no place to live. I couldn't find one.
I don't know if I could have any hope for the future.
They always said I was a strong child.
They praised me, saying \"you must be strong to not cry.\"
I didn't want those words at all.
So I pretended not to understand.
Why are you laughing?
Why are you by my side?
Why are you leaving me?
Please tell me.
When did you become strong?
Since when have you felt weakness?
How long must you wait
for the day you understand to come?
The sun is rising. I must go soon.
I can't stay in the same place forever.
You will someday be betrayed by your trust in people.
I thought it was the same as being rejected.
At the time I didn't have that kind of strength.
I definitely knew too much.
They always said I was a strong child.
They praised me, saying \"you must be strong not to cry.\"
The more people said things like that,
the more even laughing became agony.
I was born alone. I'll go on living alone.
I thought that surely that kind of life is appropriate.
