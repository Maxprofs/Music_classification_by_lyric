                        Bài hát: Get Jinxed - League Of Legends

Wanna join me? Come and play...
But I might shoot you, in your face!
Bombs and bullets won't do the trick
What we need here is a little bit of panic oh ah!

Do you ever want to catch me?
Right now I'm feeling ignored!
So can you try a little harder?
I'm really getting bored!

Come on! Shoot faster!
Just a little bit of energy yeah!
I wanna try something fun right now,
I guess some people call it anarchy!
Let's blow this city into ashes and see what Pow-Pow thinks,
It's such pathetic neatness,
But not for long 'cause you'll get jinxed!

So much better, so much fun,
Let's start from scratch and blow up the sun!

Come on! Shoot faster!
Just a little bit of energy yeah!
I wanna try something fun right now,
I guess some people call it anarchy!
Let's blow this city into ashes and see what Pow-Pow thinks,
It's such pathetic neatness,
But not for long 'cause you'll get jinxed!

Come on... Come on...
And get jinxed!
