 Let me see your tongue ring Me and my niggas try yo' bitch
 Stole the price and stang yo' botch
 All you did was take a shot
 And ball the fist to close the fist Kiss it at the mall to mill
 Hold the hands and love the ***
 Hope you ain't no essence
 Don't you know she used to trick Open the door to pop the crept
 To take your time to *** sex
 I never would a will a swept
 Knowing she'd be chewing paint All my boys the more the better
 Not a week but when you met her
 Spits the swallow while she asks
 That's as if you gon' eat me now Now nigga what? What the ***?
 (Nigga)
 I'm all about them freaky hoes That like to suck
 Them brawls wit' them booty blowin'
 Now that's the bidness
 I let this kinda camera for show Be my witness
 Them boys wit the can't block it
 Get them round
 Wit' them boys that can't rock it Drink some crown wit' it
 Niggas wit' some videos
 Or some college hoes
 That playin' hard to get
 But they the freakiest
 (Freakiest) Let me see, let me see, let me see your tongue ring
 Let me see, let me see, let me see your tongue ring

 Pussy wet as a river
 You need a boat for me nigga I be hot as a fire
 Oh, my God I'm on fire

 Or to bed with me baby

 The triple pleasure I'm sayin' I be comin' with cha'
 If your freaky like me
