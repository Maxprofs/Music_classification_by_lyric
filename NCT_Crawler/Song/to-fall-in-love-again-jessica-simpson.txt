                        Bài hát: To Fall In Love Again - Jessica Simpson

So faithfully holding tight to every dream
I thought our love would ever be
As the scent of hope slips through
My fingers plain for me to see

I can feel now in your eyes
The changing way you look at me
Where's the love we knew
Would last us eternally

And will your arms still hold me
And your eyes console me, baby
Please don't turn your back and just pretend
That your heart still needs me
And your soul completes me
Can we find a way to fall in love again

It's hard for you when your heart has opened up
To feelings that you never knew
Never thinking that you'd doubt
Our love you don't know what to do

I'd give anything, my heart, my soul
If I could pull you through
Just to find again my love
We hold so true

And will your arms still hold me
And your eyes console me, baby
Please don't turn your back and just pretend
That your heart still needs me
And your soul completes me
Can we find a way to fall in love again

And as everything night goes by
With every lovely tear I cry
It's do clear to me
I need you by my side

And will your arms still hold me
And your eyes console me, baby
Please don't turn your back and just pretend
Oh, that your heart still needs me
And your soul completes me
Can we find a way to fall in love again?
Can we find a way to fall in love again?

Oh baby, I need you to love me
For the rest of my life
If we fall in love again
Would you love me for the rest of my life?

If we fall in love again
If we fall in love again
Would you love me for the rest of my life?
If we fall in love again, again, oh yeah
If we fall in love again
Oh baby, would you love me?
If we fall in love again
If we fall in love again
If we fall in love again
                        
                    |
