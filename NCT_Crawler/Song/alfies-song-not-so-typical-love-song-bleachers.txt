                        Bài hát: Alfie's Song (Not So Typical Love Song) - Bleachers

Fake young when we met
Everything seemed alright
Like children sing on the sidewalk
Cut straight through the moonlight

[Pre-Chorus 1]
But how I love those days we didn't get out of bed
Left your taste in my mouth
Your strange voice in my head

[Chorus]
Oh, I wanna hear it again
Cause back then we were caught in a love song so loud, oh yeah
No not so typical love song
Cause it hurt us again and again
So sang that I really need you so bad, oh yeah
No not so typical love song
Cause it hurt us again and again

[Post-Chorus]
Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, hey
La, la, la, la, la
Ok look out


[Verse 2]
You'd leave the cities and chase bullet holes
That's actually star light
And in those rare moments you and I were brilliant
We were gonna be alright

[Pre-Chorus 2]
But god I loved those days we couldn't get out of bed
Left your taste in my mouth
All your words in my head

[Chorus]
And now I wanna hear it again
Cause back then we were caught in a love song so loud, oh yeah
No not so typical love song
Cause it hurt us again and again
So sang that I really need you so bad, oh yeah
No not so typical love song
Cause it hurt us again and again, woo

[Post-Chorus]
Sha, la, la, la, la, la, la
Sha, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
Sha, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, so bad, oh yeah
Sha, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la


[Outro]
1, 2, 3, 4
I wanna be alright
I wanna be alright
I wanna be alright with my baby tonight
I wanna be alright
I wanna be alright
I wanna be alright with my baby tonight, oh yeah
So sang that I really need you so bad, oh yeah
No not so typical love song
Cause it hurt us again and again
