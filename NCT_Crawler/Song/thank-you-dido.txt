                        Bài hát: Thank You - Dido

My tea's gone cold, i'm wondering why i got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window and i can't see at all
And even if i could it'd all be grey, but your picture on my wall
It reminds me that it's not so bad
It's not so bad

I drank too much last night, got bills to pay
My head just feels in pain
I missed the bus and there'll be hell today
I'm late for work again
And even if i'm there, they'll all imply that i might not last the
Day
And then you call me and it's not so bad
It's not so bad and

I want to thank you for giving me the best day of my life
Oh just to be with you is having the best day of my life

Push the door, i'm home at last and i'm soaking through and
Through
Then you handed me a towel and all i see is you
And even if my house falls down now, i wouldn't have a clue
Because you're near me and

I want to thank you for giving me the best day of my life
Oh just to be with you is having the best day of my life
