                        Bài hát: The Wrong Things - Vương Nguyên (Roy Wang)

Though it wasn't meant to be
But all the words you said to me are still so clear
Sometimes my mind plays tricks on me
And I pretend that I can see you laying here

If I'm supposed to heal in time
Should you still be on my mind like you are
'Cuz I've been living with the fear
That this pain won't disappear from my heart

Sometimes the wrong things feel so right
Sometimes the lights shine brighter at night
Sometimes the truth's a lie
So when you ask me how I am I say fine
So when you ask me how I am I say fine

It's impossible to quit
When every thought of you's a hit that keeps me high
All the memories make me numb
But they're barely just enough to get me by

You know I wonder all the time
If I occupy your mind at all
I'm embarrassed to confess
I'm not strong enough to let you go

Sometimes the wrong things feel so right
Somotimes the lights shine brighter at night
Sometimes the truth's a lie
So when you ask me how I am I say fine
So when you ask me how I am I say fine

I'm embarrassed to confess
I'm not strong enough to let you go

The wrong things feel so right
Sometimes the lights shine brighter at night
Sometimes the truth's a lie
So when you ask me how I am I say fine
So when you ask me how I am I say fine
Won't you please ask me how I am
So I would like to say I'm fine.
