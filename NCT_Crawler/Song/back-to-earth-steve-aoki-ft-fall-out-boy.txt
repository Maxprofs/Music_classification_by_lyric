                        Bài hát: Back To Earth - Steve Aoki, Fall Out Boy

It was just the beginning
I think that I was meant to be next to you, to you
On this planet spinning
I think that I was meant to be next to you, to you
And you know I found the dust to be resilient
And we're the dirtiest of the dirt
Every time we fall to pieces
We build something new out of the hurt
And we can never come back to earth
To earth, to earth, to earth, to earth
We can never come back to earth, to earth, to earth

Are you living your life or just waiting to die?
The bright, the bright, the bright
The brightest things fade the fastest
All my life, the bright, the bright, the bright
The brightest things fade out the fastest
Whoa, whoa, whoa
The brightest things fade the fastest
Whoa, whoa, whoa
The brightest things fade the fastest

Whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa, whoa

This is a crooked path
I think that I was meant to be next to you, to you
We can never come back (we can never come back)
I think that I was meant to be next to you, to you
And you know I found the dust to be resilient
And we're the dirtiest of the dirt
Every time we fall to pieces
We build something new out of the hurt
And we can never come back to earth
To earth, to earth, to earth, to earth
We can never come back to earth, to earth, to earth

Are you living your life or just waiting to die?
The bright, the bright, the bright
The brightest things fade the fastest
All my life, the bright, the bright, the bright
The brightest things fade out the fastest
Whoa, whoa, whoa
The brightest things fade the fastest
Whoa, whoa, whoa
The brightest things fade the fastest
(Fastest)

The brightest things fade the fastest
Whoa, whoa, whoa
The brightest things fade the fastest
Whoa, whoa, whoa
The brightest things fade the fastest
The brightest things fade the fastest
The brightest things fade the fastest
