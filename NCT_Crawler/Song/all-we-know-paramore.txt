                        We've tried so hard to understand, but we can't.
We held the world out in our hands and you ran away.

It takes some time to let you go and it shows.

Cause all we know is falling, it falls.
Remember, cause I know that we won't forget at all.

Now we can follow you back home but we won't.
Is this what you had waited for? Just to be alone?

It takes some time to let you go and it shows.

Cause all we know is falling, it falls.
Remember, cause I know that we won't forget at all.

You never, you never said
This wasn't what you wanted, was it? Was it?

This isn't what you wanted.
This isn't what you wanted.

Cause all we know is falling, it falls.
