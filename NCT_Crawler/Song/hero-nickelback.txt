                        I am so high. I can hear heaven. 
I am so high. I can hear heaven.
Oh but heaven, no heaven dont hear me.

And they say that a hero can save us.
Im not gonna stand here and wait. 
I'll hold onto the wings of the eagles. 
Watch as we all fly away.

Someone told me love will ALL save us. 
But how can that be, look what love gave us.
A world full of killing, and blood-spilling
That world never came.

And they say that a hero can save us. 
Im not gonna stand here and wait. 
I'll hold onto the wings of the eagles. 
Watch as we all fly away.

Now that the world isnt ending, its love that Im sending to you. 
It isnt the love of a hero, and thats why I fear it wont do. 

And they say that a hero can save us.
Im not gonna stand here and wait. 
I'll hold onto the wings of the eagles. 
Watch as we all fly away.

And they're watching us 
(Watching Us)
And they're watching us 
(Watching Us)
As we all fly away.yeahaahh...ooouuhh(#3X)
