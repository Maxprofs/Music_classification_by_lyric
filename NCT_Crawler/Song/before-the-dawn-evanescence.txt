                        Before The Dawn
Artist(Band):Evanescence

Meet me after dark again
And I'll hold you (hold you)
I am nothing more than to see you there (hold you)
And maybe tonight, we'll fly so far away
We'll be lost before the dawn

If only night could hold you
Where I can see you, my love
Then let me never ever wake again
And maybe tonight, we'll fly so far away
We'll be lost before the dawn

Somehow I know that we can't
Wake again from this dream
It's not real, but it's ours

Maybe tonight, we'll fly so far away
We'll be lost before the dawn

Maybe tonight, we'll fly so far away
We'll be lost before the dawn
                        
                    |
