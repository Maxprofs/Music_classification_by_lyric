                        Bài hát: Losing Sleep - Boyz II Men

I leave the lights on
Turn the sound up off of my TV
Trust my words, girl you’d never get the best of me
Cause you decided, we, when we divided
You made my bed but I don’t have to sleep in it

Tossing and turning in my bed
Tryna get you out of my head
If I can’t get through the night
I’m hoping and praying I can get over you

Girl you got me losing sleep
I’m never gonna dream again
If I can’t have you next to me
I’d rather not crave pretend

Girl you got me losing sleep
So I’d never close my eyes again
Cause when I do you’re all I see
And you’ll only break my heart
Won’t let you break my heart again, oh
Won’t let you break my heart again

Staring at the ceiling
Counting seconds ’til the walls cave in
Told myself that the world is not about to wait
‘Cause I decided, I was gonna fight it
And never ever ever see your face again

Tearing every memory apart
Tryna get you out of my heart
If I can’t get through the night
I’m hoping and praying I can get over you

Girl you got me losing sleep
I never wanna dream again
If I can’t have you next to me
I’d rather not crave pretend

Girl you got me losing sleep
I’d never close my eyes again
‘Cause when I do you’re all I see
You’ll only break my heart
Won’t let you break my heart again, yes
You’ll only break my heart again

I’m so tired, I’m so tired
I gotta stay up, I gotta fight it
Sleep’s out to get me, I’ll start a riot
(You can’t get away from me, you can’t get away from me)
I’m so tired, I’m so tired
I gotta stay up, I gotta fight it
Sleep’s out to get me, I’ll start a riot
(You can’t get away from me)

Girl you got me losing sleep
I’m never gonna dream again
If I can’t have you next to me
I’d rather not crave pretend

Girl you got me losing sleep
I’d never close my eyes again
‘Cause when I do you’re all I see
You’ll only break my heart
Won’t let you break my heart again, oh
