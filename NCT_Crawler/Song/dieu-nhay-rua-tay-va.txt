Wash your hands too 

I don't want you to touch me baby 
You go toilet never wash hand right? 

When you wash your body, wash your hands too (x2) 
You don't want get swine flu 
Or someone pass to you 
You better wash your body, your body, your body 

H1N1 is confirm no fun 
Be careful where you go 
Us or Mexico 
If you have temperature 
that means you got fever 
don't just take honey 
This flu is not funny 

Maybe it's time to wear a smask (hù hu hú hu) 
Maybe you have forgotten SARS (hù hu hú hu) 
Whatever the weather 
must bring thermometer 
Stick it in your armpit or down there! 

When you wash your body, wash your hands too (x2) 
You don't want get swine flu 
Though the level is yellow 
Don't be dirty fellow 
You better wash your body, your body, your body 
When you wash your body, wash your hands too (x2) 
Must wash after poo poo 
Or germs will stick to you 
Wash more than your body, your body, your body 

I know you use finger 
Don't let the smell linger 
I know you dig gold 
And wipe on some pole 
Scratch your backside 
Think you can hide 
You play your below 
take ice from my Milo 

Maybe it's time to be hygiene (hù hu hú hu) 
Maybe you should be quarantined (hù hu hú hu) 
Don't be a spreader 
We stay clean together 
We'll pick the kutus from each other's hair! 

When you wash your body, wash your hands too (x2) 
If you think you're infected 
Don't blur block go Orchard 
Don't pass to somebody, somebody, somebody 

When you wash your body, wash your hands too (x2) 
Must wash after pang jio 
The Wonder Girls damn chio 
They don't want your body, your body, your body 

Back in the days when we 
Only took a bath monthly 
Now looking at you i feel 
As sick as Kim Jong III 
Your breathe smell like kimchi, you see 
There's no vaccine eugene 
Go wash your body, your body, your body 
Wash your hands too
                        
                    |
