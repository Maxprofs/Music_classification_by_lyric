忘記他
Forget Him

And losing oneself.
(Wai Suc Liu Chi Gei)

忘記他 等於忘盡了歡喜 
To forget him, is the same as forgetting all happiness,
(Mong Gei Ta, Dun Yu Mong Chuen Liu Foon Hai)
等於將心靈也鎖住 
Locking heart and soul,
(Dun Yu Cheun Sum Ning Yea Saw Chu)
同苦痛一起 
Together with pain.
(Tun Fu Toon Yat Hey)

從來只有他 
It has always been only he

更能讓我去用愛 
And allow me to use love

將一切平凡事 變得美麗 
To change common things into something beautiful.
(Chuen Yat Chai Ping Fan See Bin Duc Mei Lai)

忘記他 怎麼忘記得起 
To forget him. How can I do that ever?

銘心刻骨來永久記住 
He has been engraved in my heart and inscribed in my bones to forever be remembered

From here to eternity.
