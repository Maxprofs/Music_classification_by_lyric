                        So keep in me up at night. It's unfamiliar ground 
Feels just like we're falling, feels like we're breaking down 
We're going through the rough. I'm scared you're gonna leave 
When I'd even soak, but right now I'm gonna speak 

No more hiding, Break the silence now 
Do we quit or try to work things out 

*Where do we go (Where do we go from here) 
Are we ready to just give it up? should we turn our back on love or should we stand within? 
I don't wanna let it go, but it can't be just me that fight for it, let's take good chance on love. 
We can't go on like this !
**Where do we go (Where do we) 
Where do we go (Where do we) 
Where do we go (Tell me) 
Where do we go from here. 

If we begin at where we are; try to mend our problems now 
We'll be looking forward, instead of looking back 
I don't wanna play it safe 'cos I wanna cross the line 
Feels just like we're standing, we're running out of time 

No more hiding, Break the silence now 
Do we quit or try to work thing out (Do we work it out ?) 

No more hiding, Break the silent now 
Beat night and we can work this out 
Where do we go from here?...
