                        When you think
Hope is lost
And giving up
Is all you got,
Blue turns black,
Your confidence is cracked,
There seems no turning back from here

Sometimes there isn't an obvious explanation
While the holiest stars can feel the strongest palpitations

That's when you can build a bridge of light,
That's what turns the wrong so right
That's when you can't give up the fight

That's when love turns nighttime into day,
That's when loneliness goes away,
That's when you gotta be strong tonight,
Only love can build us a bridge of light

On your feet, I made a storm
You're convinced that you're all alone
Look at the stars, it's straight up the dark
You'll find your heart shines like the sun
Let's not let their anger get us lost
And the need to be right cause us way too high costs

That's when love can build a bridge of light
That's what turns the wrong so right
That's when you know it's worth the fight

That's when love turns nighttime into day
That's when loneliness goes away,
That's when you gotta be strong tonight
'cause only love can build us a bridge of light

Deep breath, take it on the chin
But don't forget to let the love back in

That's when love can build a bridge of light
That's what turns the wrong so right
That's when you can't give up the fight

That's when love turns nighttime into day,
That's when loneliness goes away
That's when you gotta be strong tonight
'cause only love can build us a bridge of light

Only love can build us a bridge of light...
