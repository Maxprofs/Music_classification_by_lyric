                        Brazil, where hearts were entertaining June
 We stood beneath an amber moon
 And softly murmured "Someday soon"
 We kissed and clung together Then, tomorrow was another day
 The morning found me miles away
 With still a million things to say Now, when twilight dims the sky above
 Recalling thrills of our love
 There's one thing that I'm certain of
 Return, I will to old Brazil Brazil, where hearts were entertaining June
 We stood beneath an amber moon
 And softly murmured "Someday soon"
 We kissed and clung together Then, tomorrow was another day
 The morning found me miles away
 With still a million things to say Now, when twilight dims the sky above
 Recalling thrills of our love There's one thing that I'm so certain of
 Return (Return), I will (I will) to old Brazil That old (That old) Brazil (Brazil)
 Very old (Very old) Brazil (Brazil)
