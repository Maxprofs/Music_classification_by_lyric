                        Milk it for all it's worth, make sure you get there first
 The apple of your eye, the rotten core inside
 We all are prisoners, things couldn't get much worse
 I've had it up to here, you know your end is near You had to have it all, well, have you had enough?
 You greedy little ***, you will get what you deserve
 When all is said and done, I will be the one
 To leave you in your misery and hate what you've become Intoxicated eyes, no longer live that life
 You should have learned by now, I'll burn this whole world down
 I need some peace of mind, no fear of what's behind
 You think you've won this fight, you've only lost your mind You had to have it all, well, have you had enough?
 You greedy little ***, you will get what you deserve
 When all is said and done, I will be the one
 To leave you in your misery and hate what you've become Hold me down
 (I will live again)
 Hold me down
 (I will break it in)
 Hold me down
 (No matter in the end)
 Hold me down You had to have it all, well, have you had enough?
 You greedy little ***, you will get what you deserve
 When all is said and done, I will be the one
 To leave you in your misery and hate what you've become Heaven help you
 Heaven help you
