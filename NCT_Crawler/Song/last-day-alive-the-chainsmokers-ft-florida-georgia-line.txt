                        Bài hát: Last Day Alive - The Chainsmokers, Florida Georgia Line

[Chorus]
Run into the bright lights most nights, now or never
Always and forever the last day alive
The last day alive

[Verse 1]
Bottled up in adolescence
Bottom up forbidden essence
Twisted up in adolescence
Waking up within your arms
I feel alive and dangerous
You're dangerous, we're dangerous

[Chorus]
Run into the bright lights most nights, now or never
Always and forever the last day alive
The last day alive

[Hook]
Now or never, it's now or never
Now or never, it's now or never (the last day alive)
Now or never, it's now or never
Now or never, it's now or never
The last day alive

[Verse 2]
Promises within the air
Drowning in love affair
The night is young and we are young

[Chorus]
Run into the bright lights most nights, now or never
Always and forever the last day alive
The last day alive

[Hook]
Now or never, it's now or never
Now or never, it's now or never (the last day alive)
Now or never, it's now or never
Now or never, it's now or never
The last day alive
The last day alive

[Chorus]
Run into the bright lights most nights, now or never
Always and forever the last day alive
The last day alive
The last day alive

[Hook]
Now or never, it's now or never
Now or never, it's now or never (the last day alive)
Now or never, it's now or never
Now or never, it's now or never
The last day alive
The last day alive
The last day alive
