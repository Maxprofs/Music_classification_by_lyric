                        Bài hát: The Escapist - Nightwish

Who's there knocking at my window?
The owl and the Dead Boy
This night whispers my name
All the dying children

Virgin snow beneath my feet
Painting the world in white
I tread the way
Gonna lose myself into a tale

Come hell or high water
My search will go on
Clayborn
Voyage without an end

The nightingale in a golden cage
That's me locked inside reality's maze
Come someone make my heavy heart light?
Come undone and bring me back to life

A nightingale in a golden cage
That's me locked inside reality's maze
Can't someone make my heavy heart light?
It all starts with a lullaby

Journey homeward bound
The sound of a dolphin calling
Tearing off the mask of man
The tower
My soul guide

This is who I am
Escapist
Paradise Seeker
Farewell, time to fly
Out of sight
Out of time
Away from our lies

(The nightingale in a golden cage
That's me locked inside reality's maze)
The nightingale in a golden cage
That's me locked inside reality's maze
Can't someone make my heavy heart light?
Come undone and bring me back to life

A nightingale in a golden cage
That's me locked inside reality's maze
Can't someone make my heavy heart light?
It all starts with a lullaby

The nightingale in a golden cage
That's me locked inside reality's maze
Can't someone make my heavy heart light?
Come undone and bring me back to life
                        
                    |
