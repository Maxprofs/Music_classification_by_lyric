                        Bài hát: Begin Again (Featuring Megan Nicole And Alex Goot) - The Piano Guys, Megan Nicole, Alex Goot

(Megan)
Took a deep breath in the mirror
He didn't like it when I wore high heels
But I do

(Alex)
Turned the lock and put my headphones on

(Both)
You always said I didn't get this song
But I do, I do

(Alex)
Walked in expecting you'd be late
But you got here early and you stand and wave
I walk to you

(Both)
I walk to you

(Megan)
You pull my chair out and help me in
And you don't know how nice that is
But I do

(Both)
And you throw your head back laughing like a little kid
I think it's strange that you think I'm funny 'cause he never did

(Megan)
I've been spending the last eight months
Thinking all love ever does

(Both)
Is break and burn and end

(Alex)
But on a Wednesday in a cafe

(Both)
I watched it begin again

(Alex)
You said you never met one boy
Who had as many James Taylor records as you
But I do

(Megan)
We tell stories and you don't know why
I'm coming off a little shy
But I do

(Both)
But you throw your head back laughing like a little kid
I think it's strange that you think I'm funny 'cause he never did

(Megan)
And I've been spending the last eight months
Thinking all love ever does

(Alex)
Is break and burn and end
But on a Wednesday in a cafe

(Both)
I watched it begin again

(Both)
And we walked

(Megan)
Down the block to my car and I almost brought him up

(Both)
But you

(Megan)
Start to talk about the movies that your family watches

(Both)
Every single Christmas

(Megan)
But I want to talk about that

(Both)
And for the first time, what's past is past

(Both)
'Cause you throw your head back laughing like a little kid
I think it's strange that you think I'm funny 'cause he never did

(Megan)
And I've been spending the last eight months
Thinking all love ever does

(Both)
Is break and burn and end
But on a Wednesday in a cafe I watched it begin again

(Alex)
Yeah, But on a Wednesday in a cafe

(Both)
I watched it begin again
                        
                    |
