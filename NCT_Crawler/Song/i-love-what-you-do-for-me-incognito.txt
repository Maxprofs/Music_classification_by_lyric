                        Smile, like a happy child, feelin' safe in your embrace
 Shine, sunshine, kiss you warmly on your face
 This is the place where I am free
 There is no where else I'd rather be Than here in your arms
 Hypnotized by your charms
 Every touch means so much
 Boy, you blow my mind
 I love what you do for me
 (I love what you do, I love what you do for me)
 What you do for me, baby Close your eyes and I'll creep into your dreams
 Through your mind, weave a secret on your soul
 'Cause all that you dream, I'm dreamin' too
 No one else could take the place of you (I wanna be )
 Here in your arms
 Hypnotized by your charms
 Every touch means so much
 Boy, you blow my mind
 I love what you do for me, baby
 What you do for me, sugar I love what you do for me
 Close to you's where I wanna be
 Baby, baby, baby, baby oh Here in your arms
 Hypnotized by your charms, yeah
 Every touch means so much
 Boy, you blow my mind, yeah oh Here in your arms, you know
 Hypnotized by your charms, yeah
 Every touch means so much
 Boy, you blow my mind I love what you do, I love what you do
 For me in your arms
 I love what you do, I love what you do
 By your charms
 I love what you do, I love what you do for me You blow my mind
 I love what you do, I love what you do
 For me in your arms
 I love what you do, I love what you do
 By your charms
