                        Baby, come save me
From pain and from fear
Maybe I'm crazy
Still dreaming you are here

No more tears my baby
I cry for you
No more fears, oh maybe
I'm missin' you

Like a hero I will smile again
Like a hero in the midnight rain
Like a hero I will go
Miss you more than you will know
When you break my heart

Like a hero I will smile again
Were a woman, baby and a man
And I'm needin' your sweet love
Give me more that sweet stuff
Give me what you've got

Baby be with me
It's cold and lonely
Oceans of sorrows
A man with no tomorrow

No more tears my baby
I cry for you
No more fears, oh maybe
I'm missin' you

Like a hero I will smile again
Like a hero in the midnight rain
Like a hero I will go
Miss you more than you will know
When you break my heart

Like a hero I will smile again
Were a woman, baby and a man
And I'm needin' your sweet love
Give me more that sweet stuff
Give me what you've got
