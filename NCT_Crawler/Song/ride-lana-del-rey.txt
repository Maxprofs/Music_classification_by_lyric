                        Bài hát: Ride - Lana Del Rey

I've been out on that open road 
You can be my full time daddy, white and gold 
Singing blues has been getting old 
You can be my full time baby, hot or cold 

Don't break me down 
I've been travelin' too long 
I've been trying too hard 
With one pretty song 

I hear the birds on the summer breeze, I drive fast, I am alone in the night 
Been tryin' hard not to get into trouble, but I, I've got a war in my mind 
So, I just ride, just ride 
I just ride, just ride 

Dying young and I'm playing hard 
That's the way my father made his life an art 
Drink all day and we talk 'til dark 
That's the way the road doves do it – ride 'til dark. 

Don't leave me now 
Don't say good bye 
Don't turn around 
Leave me high and dry 

I hear the birds on the summer breeze, I drive fast, I am alone in the night 
Been tryin' hard not to get into trouble, but I, I've got a war in my mind 
I just ride, just ride 
I just ride, just ride 

I'm tired of feeling like I'm f***king crazy 
I'm tired of driving 'til I see stars in my eyes 
It's all I've got to keep myself insane, baby 
So I just ride, I just ride 

I hear the birds on the summer breeze, I drive fast, I am alone in the night 
Been tryin' hard not to get into trouble, but I, I've got a war in my mind 
I just ride, just ride 
I just ride, just ride
