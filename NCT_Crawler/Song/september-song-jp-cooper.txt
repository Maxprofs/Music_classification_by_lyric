                        Bài hát: September Song - JP Cooper

[Verse 1]
Our love is as strong as a lion
Soft as the cotton you lying
Times we got hot like an iron
You and I Our hearts have never been broken
We were so innocent darling
We used to talk till the morning
You and I

[Pre-Chorus]
We had that mixtape on every weekend
Had it repeating
Had it repeating

[Chorus]
You were my September song
Summer lasted too long
Time moves so slowly
When you're only fifteen
You were my September song
Tell me where have you gone?
Do you remember me?
We were only fifteen
And I, I remember the chorus
They were singing it for us
You were my September song
Tell me where have you gone?
Do you remember me?
We were only fifteen

[Verse 2]
Sometimes I think that I see you
Face in the strangest of places
Down on the underground station passing by

I get a mad sense of danger
Feel like my heart couldn't take it
Cause if we met we'd be strangers
You and I

[Pre-Chorus]
Still I play that mixtape every weekend
Got it repeating
Got it repeating

[Chorus]
You were my September song
Summer lasted too long
Time moves so slowly
When you're only fifteen
You were my September song
Tell me where have you gone?
Do you remember me?
We were only fifteen
And I, I remember the chorus
They were singing it for us
I hear that September song
That I'm singing along
Thinking bout you and me
Oh what a melody

[Bridge]
And as the years go by
You will still be my, be my
(September song)
You are my
(September song)

[Chorus]
You were my September song
Summer lasted too long
Time moves so slowly
When you're only fifteen
You were my September song
Tell me where have you gone?
Do you remember me?
We were only fifteen
And I, I remember the chorus
They were singing it for us
You were my September song
I remember the chorus
They were singing it for us
                        
                    |
