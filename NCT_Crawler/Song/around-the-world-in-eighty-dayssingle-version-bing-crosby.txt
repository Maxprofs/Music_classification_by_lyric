                        Around the world I searched for you
 I traveled on
 When hope was gone
 To keep a rendez-vous
 I knew some where, some time, some how
 You'd look at me
 And I would see
 The smile you're smiling now

 It might have been in country Down
 Or in New York in gayparee
 Or even London Town
 No more will I
 Go all Around The World
 For I have found
 My world in you
                        
                    |
