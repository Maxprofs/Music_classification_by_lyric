                        Bài hát: Baby - What Makes You Beautiful (The Remix - Hòa Âm Ánh Sáng) - Isaac, OnlyC, DJ Gin

You're insecure 
Don't know what for 
You're turning heads when you walk through the door-or-or 
Don't need make-up 
To cover up 
Being the way that you are is enough-ugh-ugh 

Everyone else in the room can see it 
Everyone else but you-ou 

Baby you light up my world like nobody else 
The way that you flip your hair gets me overwhelmed 
But when you smile at the ground it ain't hard to tell 
You don't know-ow-ow 
You don't know you're beautiful 

If only you saw what I can see 
You'll understand why I want you so desperately 
Right now I'm looking at you and I can't believe 
You don't know-ow-ow 
You don't know you're beautiful 
Oh-oh-oh 

That's what makes you beautiful 

So c-c-come on 
You got it wrong 
To prove I'm right I put it in a song-ong-ong 
I don't know why 
You're being shy 
And turn away when I look into your eye-ye-yes 

Everyone else in the room can see it 
Everyone else but you 

Baby you light up my world like nobody else 
The way that you flip your hair gets me overwhelmed 
But you when smile at the ground it ain't hard to tell 
You don't know-ow-ow 
You don't know you're beautiful 

If only you saw what I can see 
You'll understand why I want you so desperately 
Right now I'm looking at you and I can't believe 
You don't know-ow-ow 
You don't know you're beautiful 
Oh-oh-oh 

That's what makes you beautiful 

Na na na na na na na 
Na na 
Na na na na na 
Na na na na na na na 
Na na 
Na na na na na 

Baby you light up my world like nobody else 
The way that you flip your hair gets me overwhelmed 
But you when smile at the ground it ain't hard to tell 
You don't know-ow-ow 
You don't know you're beautiful 

Baby you light up my world like nobody else 
The way that you flip your hair gets me overwhelmed 
But you when smile at the ground it ain't hard to tell 
You don't know-ow-ow 
You don't know you're beautiful 

(Ohhhhh !!!) If only you saw what I can see 
You'll understand why I want you so desperately 
Right now I'm looking at you and I can't believe 
You don't know-ow-ow 
You don't know you're beautiful 
Oh-oh-oh 

You don't know you're beautiful 
Oh-oh-oh 


That's what makes you beautiful
Ohh wooaah Ohh wooaah Ohh wooaah
You know you love me, I know you care
Just shout whenever, And I'll be there
You are my love, You are my heart
And we will never ever ever be apart

Are we an item? Girl quit playing
We're just friends, What are you sayin'
So there's another and look right in my eyes
My first love broke my heart for the first time,

And I was like
Baby, baby, baby oohh
Like baby, baby, baby noo
Like baby, baby, baby ooh
I thought you'd always be mine mine

Baby, baby, baby oohh
Like baby, baby, baby noo
Like baby, baby, baby ohh
I thought you'd always be mine,mine

oh oh
For you, I would have done whatever
And I just cant believe we ain't together
And I wanna play it cool, But I'm loosin' you
I'll buy you anything, I'll buy you any ring
And I'm in pieces, Baby fix me
And you shake me til' you wakeï»¿ me from this bad dream

I'm going down, down, down, down~
And I just can't believe , my first love won't be around

And I'm like..
Baby, baby, baby oohh
Like baby, baby, baby noo
Like baby, baby, baby ohh
I thought you'd always be mine, mine

Baby, baby, baby ohh
Like baby, baby, baby noo
Like baby, baby, baby ohh
I thought you'd always be mine, mine

Luda, When I was thirteen , I had my first love
There was nobody that compare to my baby
And nobody can't be between us
Or can ever come above
She had me going crazy
Oh, I was starstruck
She woke me yyee-up daily
Don't need no starbucks
She make my heart pound
Lets give her beat when I see her in the street
and, At school, on the playground
But I really wanna see her on a weekend
She knows she got me dazing
Coz she was so amazing
And now, my heart is breakin'
But I just keep on sayin'..

Baby, baby, baby ohh
Like baby, baby, baby noo
Like baby, baby, baby oooh
I thought you'd always be mine,mine

Baby, baby, baby ohh
Like baby, baby, baby noo
Like baby, baby, baby oooh
I thought you'd always be mine,mine
