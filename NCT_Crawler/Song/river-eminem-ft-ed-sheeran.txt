                        Bài hát: River - Eminem, Ed Sheeran

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a liar, been a thief
Been a lover, been a cheat
All my sins need holy water, feel it washin' over me
Oh, little one, I don't want to admit to something
If all it's gonna cause is pain
Truth in my lies right now are falling like the rain
So let the river run

[Verse 1: Eminem]
He's coming home with his neck scratched to catch flack
Sweat jackets and dress slacks, mismatch
On his breast jacket’s a sex addict
And she just wants to exact revenge and get back
It's a chess match, she's on his back like a jetpack
She's kept track of all his internet chats
And guess who just so happens to be moving on to the next?
Actually, just *** on my last chick and she has what my ex lacks
'Cause she loves danger, psychopath
And you don't *** with no man's girl, even I know that
But she's devised some plan to stab him in the back
Knife in hand, says the relationship's hanging by a strand
So she's been on the web lately
Says maybe she'll be my Gwen Stacy, to spite her man
And I know she's using me to try to play him, I don't care
Hi Suzanne, but I shoulda' said "Bye Suzanne" after the first night, but tonight I am

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a liar, been a thief
Been a lover, been a cheat
All my sins need holy water, feel it washin' over me
Oh, little one, I don't want to admit to something
If all it's gonna cause is pain
The truth in my lies now are falling like the rain
So let the river run

[Verse 2: Eminem]
One night stand turned into night stayin’
He was calling so might scram, now we hug tight and
He found out, now she feels deserted and used
'Cause he left, so what? He did it first to her too
Now how am I supposed to tell this girl that we're through?
It's hard to find the words, I'm aloof, nervous, ensued
And witnessed you hurt but what you deserve is the truth
Don't take it personal, I just can't say this in person to you
So I revert to the studio like Hole In The Wall diners
Don't have to be reserved in a booth
I just feel like the person who I'm turnin' into is
Irreversible, I preyed on you like it's church at the pew
And now that I got you I don't want you
Took advantage of my thirst to pursue
Why do I do this dirt that I do?
Get on my soapbox and preach, my sermon in speech
Detergent and bleach is burned in the womb
'Cause now with her in the womb
We can't bring her in this world, shoulda' knew
To use protection 'fore I bit into your forbidden fruit
***!


[Chorus: Ed Sheeran]
I've been a liar, been a thief
Been a lover, been a cheat
All my sins need holy water, feel it washin' over me
Oh, little one, I don't want to admit to something
If all it's gonna cause is pain
The truth in my lies now are falling like the rain
So let the river run

[Bridge: Eminem & Ed Sheeran]
My name's (ooh), my name's (ooh)
Denver (ooh), river run
Call me (ooh), call me (ooh)
River (ooh), we'll let the river run

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Always the bride's maid, never "The bride, hey!"
*** can I say? If life was a highway
The seat was enclave
I’d be swerving in five lanes
Speeds at a high rate, like I'm sliding on ice maybe
That's what I made, that came at you sideways
I can't keep my lies straight, what I made
You terminate my baby
This love triangle
Left us in a wreck tangled
What else can I say? It was fun for a while
Bet I really would’ve loved your smile
Didn't really wanna abort
But *** it, what's one more lie to tell an unborn child?

[Chorus: Ed Sheeran & Eminem]
I've been a liar, been a thief
Been a lover, been a cheat
All my sins need holy water, feel it washin' over me
Oh, little one (I'm sorry), I don't want to admit to something
(I ***ed up) If all it's gonna cause is pain
The truth in my lies now are falling like the rain
So let the river run
                        
                    |
