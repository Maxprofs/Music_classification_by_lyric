                        Yeah, this nigga think we hoes or somethin' my nigga
 ***, man what the, lemme talk to the mother***er
 How hard we really mother***er is in this bitch, nah'm sayin?
 *** nigga, *** man, ol' punk ass kids, gon' throw me out the club nigga
 That don't mean nuthin' nigga, I'm gon' *** this nigga up, my nigga
 ***, lemme show this mother***er how hard this *** really is [Chorus]
 So I'm outside of the club and you think I'm a punk
 So I go to my loaded tech 9 that's off in the trunk
 I told that mother***er
 I ain't never scared (East side)
 I ain't never scared (West side)
 I ain't never scared (South side)
 I ain't never scared (North side)
 I ain't never scared (South side)
 I ain't never scared (East side)
 I ain't never scared (West side) Let the choppa go blow to your melon
 Now the plasma is oozin outta yo cerebellum
 Attention! *** nigga, now you swellin
 You ain't talkin hardcore, now is ya? Lil' bitch
 Got'em runnin scared of a bigger nigga
 'Cause I put the heat to his ummm Hilfiger
 Now on dat drank and on some of dat dank
 Pistols gettin bursted now I need something to drank [Chorus] I got a hot 4 fever, call that bitch Bonita
 Knock the apple off any bum with the hollow heat seeker
 Red Cross bitch niggas, *** the pint, she take blood by the litre
 I'll never leave her, my viscous vixen
 On liquor, send dat ass to God quicker
 No matter yo religion, you Muslim, Hebrew or Christian
 She indiscriminate with punishment, she send 'em missin
 My gun's my favourite bitch and
 And she got permanent PMS so she stay bitchin! [Chorus] No, I ain't bad, just don't kiss no ass or take ***
 And I'm a grown man, find you somebody to play wit
 If you don't like me when you see me, betta not say ***
 I'll choke yo ass out like Dre did that bitch
 You betta tell these pussies they ain't ***in wit no rookie
 I'm a Bankhead nigga, I'll take yo cookies
 So don't make it a me or you situation
 I'll have yo partner down in ICU visitation
 Like, hope for the best, but I don't think he gon' make it
 Not the way he was shiverin and shakin on the pavement
 I'll tell you what, if you make it, call 'em grace 'cause he amazin'
 Find out these verses wasn't the only thing blazin' and
 Just when you thought that I was done I was savin' the
 Best for last, nigga ***
 Like Della Reese, they my folks, it's best you just let 'em be
 'Cause I do the *** precincts and them feds just ain't never see nigga [Chorus] Yeah nigga! Just break 'em off mutha***a
 We the real niggas. All you hatin' mother***as, underachievers
 Step back, hoe nigga! Listen closely
 We ain't never scared of none of you niggas!
 T.I., Bone Crusher, Killer Mike, just break 'em off nigga! [Chorus: x2]
