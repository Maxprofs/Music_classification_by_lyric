                        Bài Hát: Invitation - Britney Spears

[Verse 1]
You evoke the feeling
This feeling I've been dreaming of
I'm ready to reveal it
Let inhibitions come undone

[Pre-Chorus]
Yes or no, but no maybe's
Not gonna beg, so don't make me
Yes or no, but no maybe's
[Chorus]
Here's my invitation, baby
Hope it sets us free
To know what you want better
Put your love all over me
Here's my invitation, baby
Come feel my energy
We give emotions to each other
Put your love all over me
Put your love all over me

[Verse 2]
I know it might seem crazy
But I'ma put you in this blindfold
I just need you to trust me
Or that you see more with your eyes closed

[Pre-Chorus]
Yes or no, but no maybe's
Not gonna beg, so don't make me
Yes or no, but no maybe's

[Chorus]
Here's my invitation, baby
Hope it sets us free
To know what you want better
Put your love all over me
Here's my invitation, baby
Come feel my energy
We give emotions to each other
Put your love all over me
Put your love all over me
Put your love all over me

[Bridge]
Feel it now
Feeling something, kinda thinking out loud
Feeling something, kinda thinking right now, right now
We could be right, right now
Right now

[Chorus]
Here's my invitation, baby
Hope it sets us free
To know what you want better
Put your love all over me
Here's my invitation, baby
Come feel my energy
We give emotions to each other
Put your love all over me
Put your love all over me
Put your love all over me
                        
                    |
