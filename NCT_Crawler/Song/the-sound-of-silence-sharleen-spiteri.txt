                        The Sound Of Silence
Hello darkness my old friend 
I've come to talk with you again
Because a vission softly creeping
Left it's seeds while i was sleeping 
And the vision
That was planted in my brain
Still remains
Within the sound of silence 
In restless dream i walked alone 
Narrow streets of cobblestone
Beneath the halo of a street lamb
I turned my collar to the cold and damp

When my eyes were stabbed
By the flash of neon light
That split the night
And touched the sound of silence
And in the nake light a saw 
Ten thousand pepole may be more 
Pepole talking without spaeking 
pepole hearing without listening 
Pepole writting songs that voice never share
And no one dare
Disturb the sound of silence
Food said i you do not know

Silence like a scancer grow 
Hear my words that i minght teach you 
Take my arm that i might reach you
But my words like silent rainrops fell
And echod in the well of silence
And the pepole bows and prays 
To the neon god the made 
And the sign flash out it's warning 
In the words that it was forming 
And the sign said the words of the prophet
Are written on the subway walls
And tenement halls
And wishper's in the sound of silence.
