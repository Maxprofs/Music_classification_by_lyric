                        Bài hát: Try A Diamond - Rihanna, P!nk

Find light in the beautiful sea 
I choose to be happy 
You and I, you and I 
We’re like diamonds in the sky
You’re a shooting star I see 
A vision of ecstasy 
When you hold me, I’m alive 
We’re like diamonds in the sky
I knew that we’d become one right away....
Where there is desire 
There is gonna be a flame 
Where there is a flame 
Someone’s bound to get burned 
But just because it burns 
Doesn’t mean you’re gonna die 
You gotta get up and try and try and try 
You gotta get up and try and try and try 
You gotta get up and try and try and try 
You gotta get up and try and try and try.
Palms rise to the universe 
As we moonshine and molly 
Feel the warmth, we’ll never die 
We’re like diamonds in the sky
You’re a shooting star I see 
A vision of ecstasy 
When you hold me, I’m alive 
We’re like diamonds in the sky
I knew that we’d become one right away....
Where there is desire 
There is gonna be a flame 
Where there is a flame 
Someone’s bound to get burned 
But just because it burns 
Doesn’t mean you’re gonna die 
You gotta get up and try and try and try 
You gotta get up and try and try and try 
You gotta get up and try and try and try 
You gotta get up and try and try and try
So shine bright, tonight you and I 
We’re beautiful like diamonds in the sky 
Eye to eye, so alive 
We’re beautiful like diamonds in the sky
Where there is desire 
There is gonna be a flame 
Where there is a flame 
Someone’s bound to get burned 
But just because it burns 
Doesn’t mean you’re gonna die 
You gotta get up and try and try and try 
You gotta get up and try and try and try 
You gotta get up and try and try and try 
You gotta get up and try and try and try
