                        Bài hát: Kung Fu Fighting - Hans Zimmer, Cee-Lo Green, Jack Black

(intro) Everybody was Kung Fu Fighting 
Those kicks were fast as lightning 
In fact, it was a little bit frightening 
But they fought with expert timing There were funky China men from funky Chinatown 
They were chopping them up 
They were chopping them down 
It's an ancient Chinese art 
And everybody knew their part 
From a feint into a slip 
And a kickin' from the hip 
Everybody was Kung Fu fighting 
Those kicks were fast as lightning 
In fact it was a little bit fright'ning 
But they fought with expert timing There was funky Billie Chin and little Sammy Chong 
He said, here comes the big boss, let's get it on 
We took the bow and made a stand 
Started swaying with the hand 
The sudden motion made me skip 
Now we're into a brand new trip Everybody was Kung Fu fighting 
Those kicks were fast as lightning 
In fact it was a little bit fright'ning 
But they did it with expert timing Everybody was Kung Fu fighting 
Those kicks were fast as lightning 
In fact it was a little bit fright'ning 
Make sure you have expert timing Kung Fu Fighting 
Is it the fastest lightning
                        
                    |
