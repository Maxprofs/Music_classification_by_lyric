                        Nothing's gonna stop me now
 Nothing's gonna stop me now There was a time I couldn't get you out of my mind
 And since the day you came you tried to take control of me
 Then came the day, I thought about running away
 And now my bags are packed, don't even think of holding me back Nothing's gonna stop me now
 And I don't want to talk it over
 I said nothing's gonna stop me now
 Gonna break it up
 Gonna take my love away, yeah, yeah Day after day, I started slippin' away
 You took my self respect and you made a fool of me
 Time after time, I turned it 'round in my mind
 And now my mind's made up to leave the past behind me Time after time, I turned it 'round in my mind
 And now my mind's made up to leave the past behind me Nothing's gonna stop me now
 Nothing's gonna stop me now There was a time I couldn't get you out of my mind
 And since the day you came you tried to take control of me
 Then came the day, I thought about running away
 And now my bags are packed, don't even think of holding me back Nothing's gonna stop me now
 And I don't want to talk it over
 I said nothing's gonna stop me now
 Gonna break it up
 Gonna take my love away, yeah, yeah Day after day, I started slippin' away
 You took my self respect and you made a fool of me
 Time after time, I turned it 'round in my mind
 And now my mind's made up to leave the past behind me Time after time, I turned it 'round in my mind
 And now my mind's made up to leave the past behind me
