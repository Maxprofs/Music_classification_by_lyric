                        Bài hát: Touch (Acoustic) - Little Mix

Just one touch, just one touch, aah, yeah

You and I and nobody else
Feeling feelings I never felt
Boy, is the way you got me under your spell, ah
Don't you keep it all to yourself

So won't you take it,
I feel like for the first time I am not faking
Fingers on my buttons and now you're playing
Master of anticipation
Don't you keep it all to yourself

Just a touch of your love is enough
To knock me off of my feet all week
Just a touch of your love, oh
Just a touch of your love, oh
Just a touch of your love is enough
To take control of my whole body
Just a touch of your love, oh
Just a touch of your love, oh

Just a touch of your love is enough
To knock me off of my feet all week
Just a touch of your love
Just a touch of your love
Just a touch of your love is enough
To take control of my whole body
Just a touch of your love
Just a touch of your love

Photograph with no T-shirt on
Why you making me wait so long?
Oh, I promise to keep this a secret I'll never tell
Yeah, don't you keep it all to yourself, oh

So won't you take it,
I feel like for the first time I am not faking
Fingers on my buttons and now you're playing
Master of anticipation
Don't you keep it all to yourself, to yourself

Just a touch of your love is enough
To knock me off of my feet all week, all week
Just a touch of your love
Just a touch of your love, oh
(Baby, a touch of your love, just a touch of your love)
Just a touch of your love is enough
To take control of my whole body, body
Just a touch of your love, your love
Just a touch of your love, oh

Just a touch of your love is enough
To knock me off of my feet all week
Just a touch of your love
Just a touch of your love, oh
Just a touch of your love is enough
To take control of my whole body
Just a touch of your love
Just a touch of your love

Just one touch of your love
Just one touch
A touch of your love
I wanna feel your touch
I want it, I want it, I want it so much

Just a touch of your love is enough
To knock me off of my feet all week
Just a touch of your love
Just a touch of your love
