                        WALK OF LIFE 

( DIRE STRAITS ) 

Here comes Johnny singing oldies, goldies 
Be bop a lula, Baby what I say 
Here comes Johnny singing I gotta woman 
Down in the tunnels, trying to make it pay 
He got the action, he got the motion 
Oh yeah the boy can play 
Dedication, devotion 
Turning all the night time into the day 

He do the song about the sweet lovin' woman 
He do the song about the knife 
He do the walk, he do the Walk Of Life 
Yeah, he do the Walk Of Life 

Here comes Johnny and hell tell you the story 
Hand me down my walkin' shoes 
Here come Johnny 
With the power and the glory 
Backbeat the talkin' blues 
He got the action, he got the motion 
Oh yeah the boy can play 
Dedication, devotion 
Turning all the night time into the day 

He do the song about the sweet lovin' woman 
He do the song about the knife 
He do the walk, he do the Walk Of Life 
Yeah, he do the Walk Of Life 

Here comes Johnny singing oldies, goldies 
Be bop a lula, Baby what I say 
Here comes Johnny singing I gotta woman 
Down in the tunnels, trying to make it pay 
He got the action, he got the motion 

Oh yeah the boy can play 
Decidation, devotion 
Turning all the night time into the day 

And after all the violence and double-talk 
There's just a song 
In all the trouble and the strife 
You do the walk, yeah, you do the Walk Of Life 
Umhum, you do the Walk Of Life
                        
                    |
