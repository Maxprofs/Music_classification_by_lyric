Âu Mỹ khác|

                        Facing the world with an empty heart I could disappear into the dark
And you were the one who could make my dreams come true
My dear, it's you
When you're not around, my heart stood still
Within you'll remain and always will

Illusions say there is another man who interfere into my plans
(Wo ai ni) I love you
(Wo ai ni) I need you
More than I ever did anyone, I've never felt like this before
(Wo ai ni) I want you
(Wo ai ni) I need you
We could be two lovers from the past, and future is our chance.
