                        Bài hát: Rain Check - Eventide

[Verse 1]
Why you talking in code?
No reason
Why you got me on hold?
Line beepin’
I knew something was ignited
When you left I wanted more
All I wanna do is get to know you
East to west to north to south, the whole you
But I need direction
You get the message

Now don’t you hit me with a rain check
I need something like a blank check
Spending a lot of emotion on tonight, yea
Don’t you hit me with a rain check
No need to make it a train wreck
Find me a time and decide soon

[Pre Hook]
Cuz I’ll be on my way
But I don’t wanna wait
My time is of the essence, don’t you know?
If you give me a day
Believe me when I say
That I could be the presence that you want

[Hook]
So tell me and you got it right now
But you gotta holler right now
Tell me and you got it right now now now now now
Yea, tell me and you got it right now
But you gotta holler right now
Tell me and you got it right now
If you'd like, then you and I could

[Verse 2]
Lemme go girl I mean it hasta la vista
You say you want it but I don't really believe ya
I can't decode a woman like you
Time and again you give me no clues
Don't want a little bit a lot is what I came for
If I got nothing at least you I could aim for
But I need direction
You get the message

Don’t you hit me with a rain check
Sign off on one of them blank checks
Don’t want to limit the moment of tonight
Yea, don’t you hit me with a rain check
No reason to cause a train wreck
Find me a time and decide soon

[Pre Hook]
Cuz I’ll be on my way
But I don’t wanna wait
My time is of the essence, don’t you know?
If you give me a day
Believe me when I say
That I could be the presence that you want

[Hook]
So tell me and you got it right now
But you gotta holler right now
Tell me and you got it right now now now now now
Yea, tell me and you got it right now
But you gotta holler right now
Tell me and you got it right now
If you'd like, then you and I could

[Bridge]
Cut the bullshit
Trigger pullin’ if it’s you and me
Only sunny weather down the timeline
Only sunny weather down the timeline
And I’ll be on my own
If you fail to find a reason to send it right now
Just send it right now

[Pre Hook]
Cuz I’ll be on my way
But I don’t wanna wait
My time is of the essence, don’t you know?
If you give me a day
Believe me when I say
That I could be the presence that you want

[Hook]
So tell me and you got it right now
But you gotta holler right now
Tell me and you got it right now now now now now
Yea, tell me and you got it right now
But you gotta holler right now
Tell me and you got it right now
If you'd like, then you and I should

[Outro]
Said you and I should
You and I should, should
Cuz you know I won’t accept a rain check
You know I won’t accept a rain check
You know I won’t accept a rain check
                        
                    |
