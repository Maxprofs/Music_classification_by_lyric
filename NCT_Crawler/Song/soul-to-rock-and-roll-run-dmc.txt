                        That's crowned, to rule the sound
 Fly world renowned, from town to town
 My hat's my helmet, my mic's my sword
 My bible' s by the door so praise the lord
 Born a King, to rule this thing
 Treats are the beats that battles bring
 I can't be beat, I won't retreat
 Victory is sweet, so I defeat
 Like a slave I gave, the world I saved
 This is the hated and ungrateful tool that's raised
 Not to be cool, I rock and rule
 I'm crowned with a jewel cause I'm down to duel
 Bled from my blow, so know one thing
 That you gotta be strong and as real as the king "I'm the king of " "rock and roll!"
 "I'm the king of " "rock and roll!"
 "I'm the king of " "rock", "I'm the king of " "rock"
 "I'm the king of " "rock and roll!"
 "I'm the king " King means rated suupreme
 From Queens never sellin' our dreams
 Its D, Joe that they don't know
 Our team yo, I'm a pro
 Don't belive me , you can go ask Joe
 Or go see Dee, Nine times the dough
 Raise hell, yell for eternity
 Run ***.C. King "I'm the king of " "rock and roll!"
 "I'm the king of " "rock and roll!"
 "I'm the king of" "rock", "I'm the king of" "rock"
 "I'm the king of rock"
