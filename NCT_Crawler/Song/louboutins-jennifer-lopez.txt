[00:-7.52]Jennifer Lopez - Louboutins (Prod. by Tricky Stewart & The-Dream)

Ahh ahh
Ohh ohh yeah
Ohh ohh
Aaaahhhhhh.. radio killa

Taking back my love (taking back my love)
Taking back my love (taking back my love)
Taking back my love (taking back my love)
Taking back my love (taking back my love)

You said, you changed
But still, nothin
You still the same
I'm just a part time lover

And I'm the blame
Shoulda went away
But yet I stay
With a part time lover

See, somedays you will love me
then you don't, then you do
then you wont, when you're here
then you're gone, I'm alone
Now you got me stressin out on the phone
But it's the last time I'm movin on
I'm throwin on my Louboutins

I'm throwing on my Louboutins
I'm throwing on my Louboutins
I'm throwing on my Louboutins
I'm throwing on my Louboutins

I'm throwing on my Louboutins
I'm throwing on my Louboutins
I'm throwing on my Louboutins
I'm throwing on my Louboutins

I've left the stage
Changed everything
No more ache, one way
For the part time lover

What goes around, comes back around
And then you get what you deserve
You part time lover

See, somedays you will love me
then you don't, then you do
then you wont, when you're here
then you're gone, I'm alone
Now you got me stressin out on the phone
But it's the last time I'm movin on
I'm throwin on my Louboutins

I'm throwing on my Louboutins
I'm throwing on my Louboutins
I'm throwing on my Louboutins
I'm throwing on my Louboutins

I'm throwing on my Louboutins
I'm throwing on my Louboutins
I'm throwing on my Louboutins
I'm throwing on my Louboutins

Watch me spread bottoms, and the back of my jeans
Watch me go bobbing, don't know what you got until it's gone
Tail lights, It's all you'll see
Watch that Phantom, exit that driveway (ay)

I'm throwing on my Louboutins
I'm throwing on my Louboutins
I'm throwing on my Louboutins
I'm throwing on my Louboutins

I'm throwing on my Louboutins
I'm throwing on my Louboutins
I'm throwing on my Louboutins
I'm throwing on my Louboutins

Watch me walk it out, walk it out
Walk it out, walk this right up out the house
Walk it out, boy watch me walk this out
Walk it out, walk this right up out the house

I'm throwing on my Louboutins (out the house)
I'm throwing on my Louboutins (out the house)
I'm throwing on my Louboutins (out the house)
I'm throwing on my Louboutins (out the house)

I'm throwing on my Louboutins (out the house)
I'm throwing on my Louboutins (out the house)
I'm throwing on my Louboutins (out the house)
I'm throwing on my Louboutins (out the house)
