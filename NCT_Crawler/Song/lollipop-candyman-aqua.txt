                        I am the Candyman, coming from Bountyland (x2)

I wish that you were my Lollipop
Sweet things I will never get enough
If you show me to the sugar tree
Will you give me a sodapop for free

*Come with me honey
I'm your sweet sugar Candyman
Run like the wind fly with me to Bountyland
Bite me I'm yours if you're hungry please understand
This is the end of the sweet sugar Candyman

**Oh my love, I know you are my Candyman
And all my love, your word is my command
Oh my love I know you are my Candyman
And all my love, let us fly to Bountyland

You are my Lollipop, sugar sugar top (x2)

I wish that I were a bubble gum
Chewing on me baby all day long
I will be begging for sweet delight
Until you say I'm yours tonight 

(Repeat * -> ** x2)

I am the Candyman, coming from Bountyland (x2)

(Repeat **)

You are my Lollipop sugar sugar top (x2)
