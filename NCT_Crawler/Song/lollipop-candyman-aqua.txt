                        Bài hát: Lollipop (Candyman) - Aqua

Oooh, I am the Candyman 
Oooh, comin' from Bountyland 
Oooh, I am the Candyman 
Oooh, comin' from Bountyland 

I wish that you were my lollipop 
Sweet things, I will never get enough 
If you show me to the sugar tree 
Will you give me a sodapop for free 

Come with me, honey, I'm your sweet sugar Candyman (oooh) 
Run like the wind, fly with me to Bountyland (oooh) 
Bite me, I'm yours, if you're hungry, please understand (oooh) 
This is the end of the sweet sugar Candyman 

Oh my love, I know you are my Candyman 
And oh my love, your word is my command 
Oh my love, I know you are my Candyman 
And oh my love, let us fly to Bountyland 

Oooh, you are my lollipop 
Oooh, sugar sugar top 
Oooh, you are my lollipop 
Oooh, sugar sugar top 

I wish that I were a bubble gum 
Chewin' on me, baby, all day long 
I will be begging for sweet delight 
Until you say I am yours tonight 

Come with me, honey, I'm your sweet sugar Candyman (oooh) 
Run like the wind, fly with me to Bountyland (oooh) 
Bite me, I'm yours, if you're hungry, please understand (oooh) 
This is the end of the sweet sugar Candyman 

Oh my love, I know you are my Candyman 
And oh my love, your word is my command 
Oh my love, I know you are my Candyman 
And oh my love, let us fly to Bountyland 

Oh my love, I know you are my Candyman 
And oh my love, your word is my command 
Oh my love, I know you are my Candyman 
And oh my love, let us fly to Bountyland 

I am the Candyman 
Comin' from Bountyland 
I am the Candyman 
Comin' from Bountyland 

Comin' from Bountyland 

Oh my love, I know you are my Candyman 
And oh my love, your word is my command 
Oh my love, I know you are my Candyman 
And oh my love, let us fly to Bountyland 

Oooh, you are my lollipop 
Oooh, sugar sugar top 
Oooh, you are my lollipop 
Oooh, sugar sugar top
