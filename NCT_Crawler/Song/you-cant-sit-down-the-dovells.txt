                        Hey, pretty baby
 (You can't sit down)
 Don't you hear
 The drummer thumping
 (You can't sit down)

 You got to shake it
 Like you're crazy
 (You can't sit down)
 Cause the band is
 Saying something
 (You can't sit down)

 Everybody is a jumping
 (You can't sit down)
 You gotta slop, bop
 Flip flop, hip hop all about
 (You can't sit down)
 (You can't sit down)

 (CHORUS)
 You gotta move, move, move
 Around and round
 (You can't sit down)
 (You can't sit down)
 You gotta fly, fly, fly
 Way off the ground
 They're putting down
 A crazy sound
 No, no, you can't sit down
 No, no, you can't sit down

 When you're on South Street
 (You can't sit down)
 And the band is really booting
 (You can't sit down)

 You hear the hip beat
 With the back beat
 (You can't sit down)
 And you see the gang a grooving
 (You can't sit down)

 Gotta get your motor moving
 (You can't sit down)
 You gotta make it, break it
 Shake it all around
 (You can't sit down)
 (You can't sit down)

 (CHORUS)

 Ah, yeah, yeah, yeah
 Hey, pretty baby
 (You can't sit down)
 Don't you really dance so fine now
 (You can't sit down)

 You're really shaking
 Like you're crazy
 (You can't sit down)
 Don't you never leave the line now
 (You can't sit down)

 Gonna do it one more time now
 (You can't sit down)
 You gotta slop, bop
 Flip flop, hip hop. never stop
 (You can't sit down)
 (You can't sit down)

 (CHORUS)

 No, no, you can't sit down
 No, no, you can't sit down
                        
                    |
