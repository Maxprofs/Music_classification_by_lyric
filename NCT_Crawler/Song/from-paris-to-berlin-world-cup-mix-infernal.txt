                        From Paris to Berlin, 
 In every disco I get in, 
 My heart is pumping for love, 
 Pumping for love, 
 'Cause when I'm thinking of you, 
 And all the things we could do, 
 My heart is pumping for love, 
 You left me longing for you

 From Paris to Berlin, 
 In every disco I get in, 
 My heart is pumping for love, 
 Pumping for love, 
 'Cause when I'm thinking of you, 
 And all the things we could do, 
 My heart is pumping for love

 Patience is a game, 
 And every night I say your name, 
 Hoping that you'll answer
 'Cause I'm going insane.
 It's quite along time ago, 
 You brought me out of control, 
 Hungry for your lovin'
 Like I know what that might be

 From Paris to Berlin, 
 In every disco I get in, 
 My heart is pumping for love, 
 Pumping for love, 
 'Cause when I'm thinking of you, 
 And all the things we could do, 
 My heart is pumping for love
 You left me *loving for you
 You left me *loving for you
 You left me *loving for you
 You left me *loving for you

 Teasing was the thing
 And now I just can't let it go
 Meeting you were something no-one else needs to know
 I guess I'm thinking of you, 
 Like I would know what to do
 If and when I found you, but I don't
 I've got no clue

 From Paris to Berlin, 
 In every disco I get in, 
 My heart is pumping for love, 
 Pumping for love, 
 'Cause when I'm thinking of you, 
 And all the things we could do, 
 My heart is pumping for love
 You left me longing for you
 You left me longing for you
 You left me longing for you
 You left me longing for you

 Who-hou-u
 Who-hou-u
 Who-hou-u
 Who-hou-u
 Who-hou-u
 Who-hou-u
 Who-hou-u

 From Paris to Berlin, 
 In every disco I get in, 
 My heart is pumping for love, 
 Pumping for love, 
 'Cause when I'm thinking of you, 
 And all the things we could do, 
 My heart is pumping for love, 
 You left me longing for you

 From Paris to Berlin, 
 In every disco I get in
 My heart is pumping for love, 
 Pumping for love, 
 'Cause when I'm thinking of you, 
 And all the things we could do, 
 My heart is pumping for love, 
 You left me longing for you, 
 You left me longing for you, 
 You left me longing for you, 
 You left me longing for you, 
 You left me longing for you
