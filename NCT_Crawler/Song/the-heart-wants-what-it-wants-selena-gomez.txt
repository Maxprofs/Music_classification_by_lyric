                        Bài hát: The Heart Wants What It Wants - Selena Gomez

You got me sippin on something
I can't compare to nothing
I bet for known I'm hoping
That after this fever I'll survive
I know I'm acting a bit crazy
Strong out, a little bit hazy
Hand over heart, I'm praying
That I'm gonna make it out alive

The bed's getting cold and you're not here
The future that we hold is so unclear
But I'm not alive until you call
And I'll bet the odds against it all
Save your advice 'cause I won't hear
You might me right but I don't care
There's a million reasons why I should give you up
But the heart wants what it wants

You got me scattered in pieces
Shining like stars and screaming
Lightining me up like Venus
But then you disappear and make me wait
And every second's like torture
Hell over trip, no more so
Finding a way to let go
Baby baby no I can't escape


The bed's getting cold and you're not here
The future that we hold is so unclear
But I'm not alive until you call
And I'll bet the odds against it all
Save your advice 'cause I won't hear
You might me right but I don't care
There's a million reasons why I should give you up
But the heart wants what it wants

This is a modern fairytale
No happy endings
No winning ourselves
But I can't imagine a life without
Bretheless moments
Breaking me down

The bed's getting cold and you're not here
The future that we hold is so unclear
But I'm not alive until you call
And I'll bet the odds against it all
Save your advice 'cause I won't hear
You might me right but I don't care
There's a million reasons why I should give you up
But the heart wants what it wants

The heart wants what it wants baby
