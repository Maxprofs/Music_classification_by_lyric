I'm A Fool To Want You
Billie Holiday

Im a fool to want you
Im a fool to want you
To want a love that cant be true
A love thats there for others too
Im a fool to hold you
Such a fool to hold you
To seek a kiss not mine alone
To share a kiss that devil has known
Time and time again I said Id leave you
Time and time again I went away
But then would come the time when I would need you
And once again these words I had to say
Im a fool to want you
Take me back, i need you
I know its wrong, it must be wrong
But right or wrong I cant get along
Without you
