                        Bài hát: Private Show - Britney Spears

[Intro]
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh

[Verse 1]
I want your attention in this room
Your eyes on mine
Sit you down, hop onto your pot of gold
You make me come alive

[Pre-Chorus]
Swing it to the left, swing it to the right
Strutting on the stage, center of the lights
Dripping in smiles, they come on down
Take your seat now

[Chorus]
Put on a private show
Pull the curtains until they close
I put on a private show
We'll be whiling all on the low
Work it, work it, boy watch me work it
Slide down my pole, watch me spin it and twerk it
Work it, work it, boy watch me work it
Slide down my pole, watch me spin it and twerk it
Put on a private show
Pull the curtains until they close
I put on a private show
We'll be whiling all on the low

[Verse 2]
We don't need crowds, we just need us
Put my feelings up, about to be rough
All my tricks, they're spectacular
My encore is immaculate

[Pre-Chorus]
Swing it to the left, swing it to the right
Strutting on the stage, center of the lights
Dripping in smiles, they come on down
Take your seat now

[Chorus]
Put on a private show
Pull the curtains until they close
I put on a private show
We'll be whiling all on the low
Work it, work it, boy watch me work it
Slide down my pole, watch me spin it and twerk it
Work it, work it, boy watch me work it
Slide down my pole, watch me spin it and twerk it
Put on a private show
Pull the curtains until they close
I put on a private show
We'll be whiling all on the low

[Bridge]
Strut it out, strut it out, eyes on me (eyes on me)
Watch me strike a pose, feel my heat (feel my heat)
Spin around, spin around, three-sixty
Ain’t no boundaries here, the camera speaks
Ooh, ooh, baby, baby
Ooh, ooh, baby, baby
Ooh, ooh, so entertaining
Ooh, ooh

[Chorus]
Put on a private show
Pull the curtains until they close
I put on a private show
We'll be whiling all on the low
Work it, work it, boy watch me work it
Slide down my pole, watch me spin it and twerk it
Work it, work it, boy watch me work it
Slide down my pole, watch me spin it and twerk it
Put on a private show
Pull the curtains until they close
I put on a private show
We'll be whiling all on the low

[Outro]
Curtains are closing now
Guess that's the end
Can we go again?
Can we do it all again?
Nah, I'll take a bow
Up, down, run it ‘round
Tasting on my apple pie
Apple pie, satisfy
                        
                    |
