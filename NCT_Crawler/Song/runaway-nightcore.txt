                        Bài hát: Runaway - Nightcore

From London to Paris 
From Berlin to Rome 
You're searching for something 
A place to call home 

Been hiding your feelings 
Went out of control 
Your destinations unknown 

Tell me 
How can it be boy? 
You're still a runaway 
You chase the dreams from heaven above 
Where in this world will you find a place to stay? 
Runaway from love 

How can it be boy? 
You're still a runaway 
You chase the dreams from heaven above, baby 
Where in this world will you find a place to stay? 
Runaway from love 
Runaway from love (runaway) 

A new town, a new place 
A knock on the door 
You came as a stranger and entered the door 
The moment I saw you, I knew it for sure 
You won't pack your bags anymore 

Tell me 
How can it be boy? 
You're still a runaway 
You chase the dreams from heaven above 
Where in this world will you find a place to stay? 
Runaway from love 

How can it be boy? 
You're still a runaway 
You chase the dreams from heaven above, baby 
Where in this world will you find a place to stay? 
Runaway from love 
Runaway from love (runaway) 

I know you don't want to be a bother 
Though your love's so undiscovered 
I want you to stay boy 
Stop running from love 

How can it be boy? 
You're still a runaway 
You chase the dreams from heaven above 
Where in this world will you find a place to stay? 
Runaway from love 

How can it be boy? 
You're still a runaway 
You chase the dreams from heaven above, baby 
Where in this world will you find a place to stay? 
Runaway from love 
Runaway from love
