                        Bài hát: Vente Pa' Ca (English Version) - Ricky Martin, Wendy (Red Velvet)

[Ricky Martin:]
Say you like me, one more time
And I won't care about the troubles in my life
Say you want me, you'd be mine
When the sunlight is reflected in your eyes

Oh baby I
I wanna know
Are we for real?
Some kind of dream
I, I wanna know 
Now can you feel the way that I feel?

If you want me like I want you baby I won't live without you
We've been through the morning light
If you're thinking what I'm thinking and you're drinking what I'm drinking 
Then it's all right
If you want me like I want you
Baby I won't live without you
Let our dreams come through tonight

Vente pa' ca
Vente pa' ca
Vente pa' ca, oh, oh

[Wendy:]
Don't tomorrow
Just tonight
Yet together we could leave the world behind
In the starlight, we will shine
Secret lovers in the secret paradise

Oh baby I
I wanna know
Are we for real?
Some kind of dream
Oh I, I wanna know
Now can you feel the way that I feel?

[Ricky Martin:]
If you want me like I want you baby I won't live without you
We've been through the morning light
If you're thinking what I'm thinking and you're drinking what I'm drinking 
Then it's all right
If you want me like I want you
Baby I won't live without you
Let our dreams come through tonight

Vente pa' ca
Vente pa' ca
Vente pa' ca, oh, oh

[Wendy:]
Baby touch me 
Hold me in this dream
And never wake me up (don't ever wake me up)

With every heartbeat
I'm falling even deeper 
I don't wanna stop
I can't never get enough

Say you want me
Say you need me, yeah
I can't wait no more I gotta know

[Ricky Martin & Wendy:]
If you want me like I want you baby I won't live without you
We've been through the morning light (through the morning light)
If you're thinking what I'm thinking and you're drinking what I'm drinking 
Then it's all right (it's all right)
If you want me like I want you
Baby I won't live without you (oh, oh)
Let our dreams come through tonight

Vente pa' ca
Vente pa' ca
Vente pa' ca, oh, oh
