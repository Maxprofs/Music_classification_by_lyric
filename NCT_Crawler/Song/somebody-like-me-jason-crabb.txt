                        The congregation parted like the Red Sea
 When that old drunk stumbled in down the aisle
 And took a seat
 Right in the middle of Amazing Grace He could feel the judgment they were passing
 Thought to himself "Ain't that just how some folks acting"
 He'd rather be on the street than in this place
 And with tears on his face You'd think somebody would put their arm around him
 You'd think somebody would hit a knee
 Pull him in, say a prayer
 That's what I'm talking 'bout right there You'd think somebody would practice what they're preachin'
 Well, I wonder who that somebody could be
 Prob'ly somebody like me Well, he's got problems nobody wants a part of
 When he got up and slipped out nobody stood up
 They don't wanna make a scene
 So they let him walk outta there without a prayer You'd think somebody would do something different
 You'd think somebody would go against the grain
 Be the one to run him down
 Bring him back and turn him around You'd think somebody would wanna make a difference
 Well, well I wonder who that somebody could be
 Prob'ly somebody like me Oh can I get a witness
 Oh yeah You'd think somebody would put their arm around him
 You'd think somebody would hit a knee now
 Pull him in, say a prayer yeah You'd think somebody would put their arm around him
 You'd think somebody would hit a knee
 Pull him in, say a prayer
 That's what I'm talking 'bout right there You'd think somebody would wanna make a difference
 Well, I wonder who that somebody could be
 Prob'ly somebody like me
