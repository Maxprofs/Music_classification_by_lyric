                        Bài hát: Break Free (Glee Cast Version) - Glee Cast

[Rachel (The Group)]
 If you want it, take it
 I should've said it before
 Tried to hide it, fake it
 I can't pretend anymore (Hoo)

 I only wanna die alive
 Never by the hands of a broken heart (Hoo)
 Don't wanna hear you lie tonight
 Now that I've become who I really are

[Myron with Sheldon and the Group]
 This is the part when I say I don't want ya

[Rachel with Sheldon and the Group]
 I'm stronger than I've been before

[Myron with Sheldon and the Group]
 This is the part when I break free

[Myron and Rachel with Sheldon and the Group]
 'Cause I can't resist it no more

[Rachel with Sheldon and the Group]
 This is the part when I say I don't want ya
 I'm stronger than I've been before
 This is the part when I break free
 'Cause I can't resist it no more

[Sheldon]
 You were better, deeper
 I was under your spell

[Sue and Will]
 Like a deadly fever, yeah, babe

[Rachel (Sheldon)]
 On the highway to hell, (Yeah) (The Group: Hoo)

[Rachel with Sam]
 I only wanna die alive
 Never by the hands of a broken heart (The Group: Hoo)
 Don't wanna hear you lie tonight
 Now that I've become who I really are

[Myron with Sheldon and the Group]
 This is the part when I say I don't want ya

[Rachel with Sheldon and the Group]
 I'm stronger than I've been before

[Myron and Rachel with Sheldon and the Group]
 'Cause I can't resist it no more

[Rachel with Sheldon and the Group]
 This is the part when I say I don't want ya
 I'm stronger than I've been before
 This is the part when I break free
 'Cause I can't resist it no more

[Rachel]
 No more, baby, 
 Ooh

[Rachel with Sheldon and the Group]
 Thought on your body
 I came alive
 It was lethal
 It was fatal

[Rachel and Sheldon (The Group)]
 In my dreams it felt so right
 But I woke up every day (Every day, every day)

[Rachel]
 Oh, baby

[Myron with Sheldon and the Group]
 This is the part when I say I don't want ya

[Rachel with Sheldon and the Group (Rachel)]
 I'm stronger than I've been before (Ooo!)

[Myron with Sheldon and the Group (and Rachel)]
 This is the part (when I break free)

[Myron and Rachel with Sheldon and the Group]
 'Cause I can't resist it no more

[Rachel with Sheldon and the Group (Rachel)]
 This is (this is) the part when I say I don't want ya
 I'm stronger than I've been before
 This is the part when I break free
 'Cause I can't resist it no more
