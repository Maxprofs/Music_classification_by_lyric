Good Charlotte - Keep Your Hands Off My Girl

Let the record play
Let the record play
Let the record play
The way that you dance
The way that you move
The way that you stare at me across the room

You carry Dior bags and you got your Chanel
You wear Louie Vitton, HG and YSL
Now I got Bathing Ape, I got DCMA
I got brass knuckles hanging from my neck and my chain
I got a model 26, but she stays in her place
I got a kershaw neatly tucked inside of my waist

And the record keeps playin the same old song
The hipsters be muggin on me all night long
They said (aha, aha)
Keep your hands off my girl
Keep your hands off my girl
They said (aha, aha)
But the record keeps playing the same old song
They said (aha, aha)
Keep your hands off my girl
Keep your hands off my girl

Now she\'s sweatin my friends and my hurricane shoes
She likes the records I spin, my Adam Barton tattoos
But she can\'t say what\'s up, so what does she do
She just stays posted at the other side of the room
I got AMC tattood on my hand, I got Black Wall Street on a black bandana

And the record keeps playin the same old song
The hipsters be muggin on me all night long
They said (aha, aha)
Keep your hands off my girl
Keep your hands off my girl
They said (aha, aha)
But the record keeps playing the same old song
They said (aha, aha)
Keep your hands off my girl
Keep your hands off my girl

She, she, she dont wanna talk about it
He, he, he wants to fight about me, me
I dont wanna fight about it, I just wanna be about it
I\'m just trying to stay up out it.

Stepped out the wagon, you know the boy starts to hate
The girl that came with them, Looks Like Thatâ€™s Not The Boy She Dates
They get to fightin and swearing, and now the boyfriend is starin
The disco ball on the ceiling looks the chain that I\'m wearing.

But the music keep playing
I got brass knuckles hanging from my neck and my chain
I got brass knuckles hanging from my neck and my chain

And the record keeps playin the same old song
The hipsters be muggin on me all night long
They said (aha, aha)
Keep your hands off my girl
Keep your hands off my girl
But the record keeps playing the same old song
The hipsters be muggin on me all night long
They said (aha, aha)
Keep your hands off my girl
Keep your hands off my girl

You carry Dior bags and you got your Chanel
You wear Louie Vitton, HG and YSL
Now I got Bathing Ape, I got DCMA
I got brass knuckles hanging from my neck and my chain
I got brass knuckles hanging from my neck and my chain
