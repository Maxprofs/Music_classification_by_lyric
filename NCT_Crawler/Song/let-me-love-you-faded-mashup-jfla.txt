                        Bài hát: Let Me Love You & Faded (Mashup) - J.Fla

You were the shadow to my light 
Did you feel us 
Another Start 
You fade away 
Afraid our aim is out of sight 
Wanna se us 
Alive

Don't you give up, nah-nah-nah 
I won't give up, nah-nah-nah 
Let me love you 
Let me love you 
Don't you give up, nah-nah-nah 
I won't give up, nah-nah-nah 
Let me love you 
Let me love you 

Say, go through the darkest of days 
Heaven's a heartbreak away 
Never let you go, never let me down 
Oh, it's been a hell of a ride 
Driving the edge of a knife 
Never let you go, never let me down 

Don't you give up, nah-nah-nah 
I won't give up, nah-nah-nah 
Let me love you 
Let me love you 
Don't you give up, nah-nah-nah 
I won't give up, nah-nah-nah 
Let me love you 
Let me love you
