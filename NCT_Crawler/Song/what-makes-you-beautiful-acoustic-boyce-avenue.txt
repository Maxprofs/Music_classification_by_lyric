                        Bài hát : What Makes You Beautiful (Acoustic) - Boyce Avenue

You're insecure
Don't know what for
You're turning heads when you walk through the door-or-or
Don't need make-up
To cover up
Being the way that you are is enough-ugh-ugh

Everyone else in the room can see it
Everyone else but you-ou

Baby you light up my world like nobody else
The way that you flip your hair gets me overwhelmed
But when you smile at the ground it ain't hard to tell
You don't know-ow-ow
You don't know you're beautiful

If only you saw what I can see
You'll understand why I want you so desperately
Right now I'm looking at you and I can't believe
You don't know-ow-ow
You don't know you're beautiful
Oh-oh-oh

That's what makes you beautiful

So c-c-come on
You got it wrong
To prove I'm right I put it in a song-ong-ong
I don't know why
You're being shy
And turn away when I look into your eye-ye-yes

Everyone else in the room can see it
Everyone else but you

Baby you light up my world like nobody else
The way that you flip your hair gets me overwhelmed
But you when smile at the ground it ain't hard to tell
You don't know-ow-ow
You don't know you're beautiful

If only you saw what I can see
You'll understand why I want you so desperately
Right now I'm looking at you and I can't believe
You don't know-ow-ow
You don't know you're beautiful
Oh-oh-oh

That's what makes you beautiful

Na na na na na na na
Na na
Na na na na na
Na na na na na na na
Na na
Na na na na na

Baby you light up my world like nobody else
The way that you flip your hair gets me overwhelmed
But you when smile at the ground it ain't hard to tell
You don't know-ow-ow
You don't know you're beautiful

Baby you light up my world like nobody else
The way that you flip your hair gets me overwhelmed
But you when smile at the ground it ain't hard to tell
You don't know-ow-ow
You don't know you're beautiful

(Ohhhhh !!!) If only you saw what I can see
You'll understand why I want you so desperately
Right now I'm looking at you and I can't believe
You don't know-ow-ow
You don't know you're beautiful
Oh-oh-oh

You don't know you're beautiful
Oh-oh-oh
That's what makes you beautiful
