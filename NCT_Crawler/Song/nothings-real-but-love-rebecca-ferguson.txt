                        Standing in a line
 Wonder why it don't move
 Tryna get a hand
 Watching people break the rules
 Maybe the man in charge, doesn't like my face
 But then as real not a always good And nothing's real but love
 Nothing's real but love
 No money, no house, no car, can beat love... The roar just opened light
 As it don't grand like blues
 See who can be the waste
 Watch what I can do
 But then the door gets slammed, slammed right in my face
 And I guess this world not always good And nothing's real but love
 Nothing's real but love
 No house, no car, no job, can beat love... It won't fill you up No money, no house, no car, is like love... La la la la la la
 Yeaaah I put it all away
 Holding it down for a rainy day
 But wouldn't that day will come
 I need love No money, no house, no car, is like love... It don't fill you up
 It won't build you up
 It won't fill you up It's not love! And nothing's real but love No money, no house, no car, is like love... Nothing's real but love No money, no house, no car, is like love....
