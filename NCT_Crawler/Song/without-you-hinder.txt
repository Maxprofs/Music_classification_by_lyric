                        I just wanna be alone tonight
I just wanna take a little breather
'Cause lately all we do is fight
And every time it cuts me deeper

'Cause something's changed
You've been acting so strange
And it's taking its toll on me
It's safe to say that I'm ready to let you leave

Without you, I live it up a little more every day
Without you, I'm seeing myself so differently
I didn't wanna believe it then but it all worked out in the end
When I watched you walk away, well, I never thought I'd say
I'm fine without you

Called you up 'cause it's been long enough
And you said that you were so much better
We have done a lot of growing up
We were never meant to be together

'Cause something changed
You were acting so strange
And it's taken its toll on me
It's safe to say that I'm ready to let you leave

Without you, I live it up a little more every day
Without you, I'm seeing myself so differently
I didn't wanna believe it then but it all worked out in the end
When I watched you walk away, well, I never thought I'd say
I'm fine without you

'Cause something changed
You were acting so strange
And it's taken its toll on me
It's safe to say that I'm ready to let you leave
Whoa! Yeah!

Without you, I live it up a little more every day
Without you, I'm seeing myself so differently
I didn't wanna believe it then but it all worked out in the end
When I watched you walk away, well, I never thought I'd say
I'm fine without you

Without you!
Without you!
Without you!

I just wanna be alone tonight
I just wanna take a little breather
