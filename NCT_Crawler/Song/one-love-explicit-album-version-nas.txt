                        [Verse One]
 Whattup kid? I know *** is rough doing your bid
 When the cops came you shoulda slid to my crib
 *** it black, no time for looking back it's done
 Plus congratulations you know you got a son
 I heard he looks like you, why don't your lady write you?
 Told her she should visit, that's when she got hyper
 Flippin, talk about he acts too rough
 He didn't listen he be riffin' while I'm telling him stuff
 I was like yeah, shorty don't care, she a snake too
 ***ing with the niggaz from that fake crew that hate you
 But yo, guess who got shot in the dome-piece?
 Jerome's niece, on her way home from Jones Beach - it's bugged
 Plus little Rob is selling drugs on the dime
 Hangin out with young thugs that all carry 9's
 At night time there's more trife than ever
 Whattup with Cormega, did you see 'em, are y'all together?
 If so then hold the fort down, represent to the fullest
 Say whassup to Herb, Ice and Bullet
 I left a half a hundred in your commissary
 You was my nigga when push came to shove
 One what? One love

 [Verse Two]
 Dear Born, you'll be out soon, stay strong
 Out in New York the same *** is goin on
 The crack-heads stalking, loud-mouths is talking
 Hold, check out the story yesterday when I was walking
 The nigga you shot last year tried to appear like he hurtin' something
 Word to mother, I heard him fronting
 And he be pumping on your block
 Your man gave him your glock
 And now they run together, what up son, whatever
 Since I'm on the streets I'ma put it to a cease
 But I heard you blew a nigga with a ox for the phone piece
 Whylin on the Island, but now with Elmira
 Better chill cause them niggaz will put that ass on fire
 Last time you wrote you said they tried you in the showers
 But maintain when you come home the corner's ours
 On the reels, all these crab niggaz know the deal
 When we start the revolution all they probably do is squeal
 But chill, see you on the next V-I
 I gave your mom dukes loot for kicks, plus sent you flicks
 Your brother's buck whylin' in four maine he wrote me
 He might beat his case, 'til he come home I play it low key
 So stay civilised, time flies
 Though incarcerated your mind (dies)
 I hate it when your mum cries
 It kinda wants to make me murder, for real-a
 I've even got a mask and gloves to bust slugs for one love

 [Verse Three]
 Sometimes I sit back with a Buddha sack
 Mind's in another world thinking how can we exist through the facts
 Written in school text books, bibles, et cetera
 *** a school lecture, the lies get me vexed-er
 So I be ghost from my projects
 I take my pen and pad for the week
 And hittin nails while I'm sleepin
 A two day stay, you may say I need the time alone
 To relax my dome, no phone, left the 9 at home
 You see the streets have me stressed somethin terrible
 ***in with the corners have a nigga up in Belleville
 Or H. D. M., hit with numbers from 8 to 10
 A future in a maximum state pen is grim
 So I comes back home, nobody's helpin shorty doo-wop
 Rollin two Phillies together in the Bridge we called 'em oowops
 He said, "Nas, niggaz could be bustin' off the roof
 So I wear a bullet proof and pack a black tres-deuce"
 He inhaled so deep, shut his eyes like he was sleep
 Started coughing when I peeked to watch me speak
 I sat back like the mack, my army suit was black
 We was chillin' on these benches where he pumped his loose cracks
 I took an l when he passed it, this little ***
 Keeps me blasted he starts talkin mad ***
 I had to school him, told him don't let niggaz fool him
 Cause when the pistol blows that's when a murder be the cool one
 Tough luck when niggaz are struck, families *** up
 Could've caught your man, but didn't look when you bucked up
 Mistakes happen, so take heed never bust up
 At the crowd catch him solo, make the right man bleed
 Shorty's laugh was cold blooded as he spoke so foul
 Only twelve trying to tell me that he liked my style
 Then I rose, wiping the blunts ash from my clothes
 Then froze only to blow the herb smoke through my nose
 And told my little man that I'm a go cyprose
 There's some jewels in the skull that he can sell if he chose
 Words of wisdom from nas try to rise up above
 Keep an eye out for jake shorty what
 One love
