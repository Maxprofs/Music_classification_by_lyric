                        Song: Beautiful Trauma - P!nk

We were on fire
I slashed your tires
It's like we burned so bright, we burned out
I made you chase me
I wasn't that friendly
My love, my drug, we're *** up, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I've been on the run so long, they can't find me
You waken up to remember I'm pretty
And when the chemicals leave my body
Yeah, they're gonna find me in a hotel lobby
'Cause
Times they keep coming, all night
Laughing and ***
Some days I can barely breathe
After we were high on the love
Don't doubt it was you

[Chorus]
The pill I keep taking
The nightmare I'm waking
There's nothing, no nothing, nothing but you
My perfect rock bottom
My beautiful trauma
My love, my love, my drug, oh


[Post-Chorus]
My love, my love, my love, my drug, oh
My love, my love, my love, my drug, oh
My love, my love, my love, my drug, oh
My love, my love, my drug, we're *** up

[Verse 2]
You punched a hole in the wall and I framed it
I wish I could feel things like you
Everyone's chasing that holy feeling
And if we don't stay lit we'll blow out
Blow out

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause we've been on the run so long they can't find us
Who's gonna have to die to remind us
That it feels like we chose this blindly
Now I'm gonna *** up a hotel lobby
'Cause
Times they keep coming, last night
I might've messed it up again
Some days I can barely breathe
But after we were high on the love
Don't doubt it was you

[Chorus]
The pill I keep taking
The nightmare I'm waking
There's nothing, no nothing, nothing but you
My perfect rock bottom
My beautiful trauma
My love (my love), my love, my drug, oh


[Post-Chorus]
My love, my love (my love), my love, my drug, oh
My love (my love), my love (my drug), my love, my drug, oh
My love (my love), my love (my love), my love, my drug, oh
(My drug) My love, my love, my drug, we're *** up

[Bridge]
(Hands up)
Times they keep coming, all night
Laughing and ***
Somedays I can barely breathe
After we were high on the love
Don't doubt it was you

[Chorus]
The pill I keep taking
The nightmare I'm waking
There's nothing, no nothing, nothing but you
My perfect rock bottom
My beautiful trauma
My love, my love, my drug, oh
                        
                    |
