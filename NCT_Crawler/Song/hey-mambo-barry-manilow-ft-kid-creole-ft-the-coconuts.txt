                        Bài hát: Hey Mambo - Barry Manilow, Kid Creole, The Coconuts

Nobody knew who he really was
 But they called him Mambo when he played
 He became the king, king of Latin swing
 And oh, the music that he made Hey mambo
 Did your mama teach you that
 Hey mambo
 Did she know what she begat They used to come in their fancy threads
 And he always turned them inside out
 They would jam the floor, they would beg for more
 And when they got it they would shout Hey mambo
 Did your mama teach you that
 Hey mambo
 Did she know what she begat
 Take it away Hey mambo
 Did your mama teach you that
 Hey mambo
 Did she know what she begat
 Take it away [Incomprehensible]
 Do it again Hey mambo, hey mambo
 Hey mambo, hey mambo
 Hey mambo
