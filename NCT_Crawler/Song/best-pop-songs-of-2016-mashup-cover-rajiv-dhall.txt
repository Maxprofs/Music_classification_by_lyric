                        Bài hát: Best Pop Songs Of 2016 Mashup Cover - Rajiv Dhall

Grips on your waist 
Front way, back way 
You know that I don't play 
Streets not safe 
But I never run away 
Even when I'm away 
I'm work, work, work, work, work, work, work 
You don't gotta go to 
Work work work work work 
He said me haffi 
Work work work work work work! 
I took a pill in Ibiza 
To show Avicii I was cool 
And when I finally got sober, felt 10 years older 
But *** it, it was something to do 
Oh, it's just me, myself and I 
Solo ride until I die 
'Cause I got me for life 
I hate you I love you 
I hate that I love you 
Don't want to, but I can't put 
Nobody else above you 
feeling you're sinking, I will jump right over 
Into cold, cold water for you 
My youth 
My youth is yours 
Trippin' on skies, sippin' waterfalls 
My youth 
My youth is yours 
Run away now and forevermore 
Once I was seven years old my momma told me 
Go make yourself some friends or you'll be lonely 
pain, seeing the pleasure 
Nobody but you, ‘body but me
I didn't know that I was starving 'til I tasted you 
I'm tryna put you in the worst mood, ah 
P1 cleaner than your church shoes, ah 
Milli point two just to hurt you, ah 
All red Lamb' just to tease you
baby pull me closer in the back seat of your Rover 
That I know you can't afford 
Bite that tattoo on your shoulder 
Pull the sheets right off the corner 
Of the mattress that you stole 
From your roommate back in Boulder 
We ain't ever getting older 
That girl is a real crowd pleaser 
Small world, all her friends know of me 
All my friends are heathens, take it slow 
Wait for them to ask you who you know
Welcome to my house 
Baby take control now 
We can't even slow down 
We don't like to go out 
I got this feeling inside my bones 
It goes electric, wavey when I turn it on 
All through my city, all through my home 
We're flying up, no ceiling, when we in our zone 
You needed me 
To treat you better
                        
                    |
