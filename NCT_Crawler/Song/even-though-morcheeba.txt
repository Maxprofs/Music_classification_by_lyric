                        Even Though lyrics by Morcheeba
constant drifting space no fear by a pepper moon
look at all the waves down here did we peak too soon
all the deadly dreams we had that i cant believe
the universal messages that we don't receive

even though we know its forever changing
even though we know we lie and wait
even though we know the hidden danger
i hope its not too late

slowly follow shining stars for the solar flare
im on borrowed time right now running low on air
its a pity you cant see such a travesty
gonna give myself to the deep majesty

even though we know its forever changing
even though we know we lie and wait
even though we know the hidden danger
i hope its not too late

la na na naa
la na na ne naa
la la na naa na naa

even though we know its forever changing
even though we know we lie and wait
even though we know the hidden danger
i hope its not too late

even though we know its forever changing
even though we know we lie and wait
even though we know the hidden danger
i hope its not too late

la la na naa
la na na ne naa
la la na naa na naa
                        
                    |
