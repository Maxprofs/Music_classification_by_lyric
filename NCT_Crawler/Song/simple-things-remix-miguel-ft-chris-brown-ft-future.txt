                        Bài hát: Simple Things (Remix) - Miguel, Chris Brown, Future

She said, I don't want a model 
I don't want a movie star 
You don't have to win the lotto, oh 
I want you to win my heart, yeah

She said I just want someone true
She said I just want someone to

Smoke with me babe and lay with me babe
And laugh with me babe, I just want the simple things
To smoke with me babe and laugh with me baby
And lay with me babe cause I just want the simple things
And I just want you, oh yeah yeah yeah yeah
I want you, oh yeah oh

I said, I don't need a model
Baby I don't need a debutante
Just be a tough act to follow
You know, a free spirit, with a wild heart

Alright, I said I just want someone real and someone true
I need you to smoke with me baby

Smoke with me baby, lay with me baby
Laugh with me baby girl, I just want the simple things
Smoke with me baby, lay with me baby
Laugh with me baby girl, I just want the simple things

I just wanna keep my Tom Fords on while I get some head
Hol' up, hol' up, hol' up, hol' up, hol' up, oh
I take your spirit like the grim reaper
Hold you so close I feel your heart beatin'
Damn size with that juice, juice, we conversate and do jitsu
Pass off that loud to you, you gon' roll it up with no issue
It's why this can't be keeping one thou'
Just knowing you gon' be there when the mile down there with me
New Range Rover Autobiography
You can let your girl get in front, I play the back seat
Relaxing your mind, that's my intuition
Once our chemistry combine, love is revolution
I cherish every moment, I'm a better man
I get to dancing with the devil, hope you understand
I be floating 'round with the sauce bag on me
I hope you hold me down 'til I fade away

I just want you
(Fade away, fade away, fade away
Hold me down 'til I fade away)
Look at me baby, I just want you
You, I want you baby
You, alright, I just want you
You

Smoke with me babe and lay with me babe
And laugh with me babe, I just want the simple things
To smoke with me babe and lay with me babe now
And laugh with me baby cause I just want the simple things

I just want you, I just want you
Give me all of you
All of you darling, oh, I want you
I want you, I just want the simple things
