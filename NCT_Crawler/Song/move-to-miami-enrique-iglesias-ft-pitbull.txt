                        Bài hát: Move To Miami - Enrique Iglesias, Pitbull

She gon' make you move to Miami
She moving like a gypsy (gypsy, gypsy)
Her body got me tipsy
I should take a step back, fall back
This girl got me feelin' risky
She ready for the taking
And I got the motivation (yeah!)
'Cause when you see her dance there's a chance
You might not come home from vacation

[Pitbull, Enrique Iglesias:]
And if you look you'll fall in love
She got that ass, she make it clap
She'll leave you shook
And now you hooked
The way she dance
She gon' make you move to Miami

[Enrique Iglesias:]
She gon' make you
She gon' make you move
She gon' make you move to Miami
She gon' make you
She gon' make you move
She gon' make you move to Miami

Uh yeah!
She gon' make you move to Miami

Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, we gon' party
Freakin' every weekend, baby, we just getting started
Y síguete moviento que todo' te 'tán viendo
Damn, you got me, girl, that body's built like a Bugatti (skr, skr, skr)

[Pitbull, Enrique Iglesias:]
And if you look you'll fall in love (fall in love)
She got that ass, she make it clap (make it clap)
She'll leave you shook
And now you hooked (now you hooked)
The way she dance
She gon' make you move to Miami

She gon' make you
She gon' make you move
She gon' make you move to Miami
She gon' make you
She gon' make you move
She gon' make you move to Miami

Yeah!
Uh yeah!
(Yeah)
She gon' make you move to Miami

[Pitbull:]
What happens in Miami, never happened
She said "No hands", booty still clapping
She wanna be Eve, baby, here's an apple
Welcome to the booty shakin' capital
M.I.A
Where the mamis off the chain
Where the mamis get loose
Where the mamis don't play
Where their body's like "Boom!"
Where their booty's like "Bang!"
Ya tú sabe', man

[Enrique Iglesias, Pitbull:]
She gon' make you
She gon' make you move
She gon' make you move to Miami
She gon' make you
She gon' make you move
She gon' make you move to Miami

Yeah!
Uh yeah!
(Yeah)
She gon' make you move to Miami
Uh yeah!
(Uh, yeah)
She gon' make you move to Miami

She gon' make you move to Miami...
