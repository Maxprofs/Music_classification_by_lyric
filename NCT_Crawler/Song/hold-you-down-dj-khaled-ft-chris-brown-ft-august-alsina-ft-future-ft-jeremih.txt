                        I'll hold you down
 I'm on my way All you've been thinking about
 Do anything you want and let emotion rule your mind (Rule your mind)
 And now you say you dream about doing it anyway
 Oh yeah, just tell me where it's on your mind (On your mind)
 Sit in my whip and see the stars (And see the stars)
 Show me just who you are (Show me just who you are)
 You know I really hold you down (Hold you down)
 And when you not around (When you not around) I'll hold you down
 (I'm the one gon' hold you down)
 (I'm the one gon' hold you down)
 I'm on my way
 (I'm the one be rolling up in that Bentley truck)
 ('Cause I'm old enough)
 Want you here right now
 (You the one that got all the needs)
 (Give me all of you or all of me)
 I'm on my way (I'm on my way)
 (I'm the one that's gon' hold you down)
 (I'm the one gon' hold you down) I had some problems back home (So I heated up)
 I ain't with that bull*** at all (Then I laid it down)
 Maybe it's that Virginia in me (Nigga say something)
 Have a young nigga go so hard
 Through it all you stuck with me
 Through it all you never ducked off like a coward when he hit me
 Get me? Girl I swear to God you the real one and you know it
 And I don't hurt anyone of ya'll for the real one and you know it
 And I hold it down
 Started from the bed, ended up on the floor
 And now let that ass up off the ground
 I'mma put you on my shoulders, let me give you what's in store
 Girl, you deserve it, all the time you been servin'
 Away from the realest nigga in it, I'mma take you away
 And I'll hold you down, (I'mma hold you down)
 I'mma hold you down baby I'll hold you down
 (I'm the one gon' hold you down)
 (I'm the one gon' hold you down)
 I'm on my way
 (I'm the one be rolling up in that Bentley truck)
 ('Cause I'm old enough)
 Want you here right now
 (You the one that got all the needs)
 (Give me all of you or all of me)
 I'm on my way (I'm on my way)
 (I'm the one that's gon' hold you down)
 (I'm the one gon' hold you down) I'm the one gone hold you down
 Put you in that Ghost so you enjoy the town
 Even when the roads is down
 You mesmerized by the flying sky
 We gotta socialize and cherish times
 This *** is deeper than love
 I pull up in that Lamborghini, the doors in the sky
 *** is straight up suicide
 You in that new Bentley truck
 New, new Bentley truck
 Oh, oh, oh, ooh
 We've been playing in that Versace (I swear)
 We go to Abu Dhabi for a hobby
 Your body my new Bugatti I'll hold you down
 (I'm the one gon' hold you down)
 (I'm the one gon' hold you down)
 I'm on my way
 (I'm the one be rolling up in that Bentley truck)
 ('Cause I'm old enough)
 Want you here right now
 (You the one that got all the needs)
 (Give me all of you or all of me)
 I'm on my way (I'm on my way)
 (I'm the one that's gon' hold you down)
 (I'm the one gon' hold you down) Live an expensive life and I'm just getting started
 I get instant hype cause you forever my lady
 Forever my baby (Real life)
 Hold you down, hold you down
 Girl you helped me up when I was down
 In and out, girl
 Hold you down like I'm supposed to
 Real nigga, I know you, real nigga, I know you I'll hold you down
 (I'm the one gon' hold you down)
 (I'm the one gon' hold you down)
 I'm on my way
 (I'm the one be rolling up in that Bentley truck)
 ('Cause I'm old enough)
 Want you here right now
 (You the one that got all the needs)
 (Give me all of you or all of me)
 I'm on my way (I'm on my way)
 (I'm the one that's gon' hold you down)
 (I'm the one gon' hold you down)
