                        I can't decide
 I don't know
 Which way to go?
 The options multiply
 The choices grow
 Which way to go?
 What should I buy?
 What should I be?
 Which way to go?
 (Doctor, lawyer, Indian chief)
 So much comes at you
 Too much for me
 Which way to go? Elusive dreams and vague desires
 Fanned to fiery needs by golden boys
 In ad empires

 Fiction of the papers
 Fiction of the image and the image makers
 Fiction of the magazines
 Fiction of the movies
 Fiction of the "Buy me," "Watch me," "Listen to me" I can't decide
 I'm so confused
 Which way to go?
 I'm being useful here
 I'm being used
 Which way to go?
 Some line gets drawn
 What line is this?
 Which way to go?
 Could be a threshold or a precipice
 Which way to go? Elusive dreams and vague desires
 Fanned to fiery needs by sexy boys
 In flaming T.V. fires

 I don't know
 Which way to go?
 The more you learn
 The less you know
 Which way to go?
 Some follow blind
 And never know
 Which way to go?
 To lead you need some place to go
 Which way to go? Elusive dreams and vague desires
 Fanned to fiery needs by deadly deeds
 In falling empires
