                        Sometimes I'm so weary
 Sometimes I'm so low
 If not for your sweet love
 I think I would move to Mexico TV shows a city
 And everything is down
 Find your friends and families
 'Neath this earthquake shaken town Mexico, Mexico
 Down the highway, down the line
 'Cross that border
 Back in time to Mexico Sometimes I'm so weary
 How can I complain?
 All they got is a cardboard box
 To sleep in when it rains Who will tell his mother?
 Who will take the news?
 Who will bring his [Incomprehensible] is gone?
 Black and all her blues Mexico, Mexico
 Down the highway, down the line
 'Cross that border
 Back in time to Mexico Sometimes I'm so weary
 I must be insane
 Ship me down to Mexico
 And show me 'bout some pain Mexico, Mexico
 Down the highway, down the line
 'Cross that border
 Back in time to Mexico Mexico, Mexico
