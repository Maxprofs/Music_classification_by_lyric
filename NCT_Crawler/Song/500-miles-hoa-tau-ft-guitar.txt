                        Bài hát: 500 Miles - Hòa Tấu, Guitar

If you miss the train I'm on 
You will know that I has gone 
You can hear the whistle blow a hundred miles 

A hundred miles, a hundred miles 
A hundred miles, a hundred miles 
You can hear the whistle blow a hundred miles 

Yes, I'm one,Yes, I'm two 
Yes, I'm three,Yes, I'm four 
Lord, I'm 500 miles away from my home 

Away from home, away from home 
Away from home, away from home 
Yes, I'm 500 miles away from home 

Not a shirt on my back 
Not a pen near to my name 
Oh, I can't go back home this a-way 

This a-way, this a-way 
This a-way, this a-way 
Oh, I can't go back home this a-way 

So if you miss the train I'm on 
You will know that I has gone 
You can hear the whistle blow a hundred miles...
                        
                    |
