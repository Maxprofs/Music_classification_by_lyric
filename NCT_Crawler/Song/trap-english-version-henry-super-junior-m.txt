                        Trap (English Version) - Henry (Super Junior-M)

Like a kitty in a cage
Like a puppy in a box on a plane
Like a driver I’m stuck in this lane
On this lane, yeah
I can’t seem to find a way
Like an employee on a minimum wage
Like a broken GPS can’t locate
Can’t locate, Oh

We started out fine, take look at us now
You leave me no choice and I gotta break out
But I’m, I’m Trapped I’m Trapped

And I’m losing it I find my inner self, try to stay true to it
Gotta make a way out, ‘cause you ain’t true to me, ain’t true to me, I’m Trapped I’m Trapped
And now you’re losing me We had a future and a plan
But you don’t stick to it You have changed, but I’m the same
I haven’t changed a bit, haven’t changed a bit I’m Trapped I’m Trapped
I’m Trapped Oh- I’m Trapped Oh-

Prisoner, I can’t escape
Where do I find the strength?
To break away from this ball and chain
This ball and chain
Everyday is same old same
Like I’m locked up and it drives me insane
Like a spider tryin’ to run from the rain
From the rain, Yeah

We started out fine, take look at us now
You leave me no choice and I gotta break out
But I’m, I’m Trapped I’m Trapped

And I’m losing it I find my inner self, try to stay true to it
Gotta make a way out, ‘cause you ain’t true to me, ain’t true to me, I’m Trapped I’m Trapped
And now you’re losing me We had a future and a plan
But you don’t stick to it You have changed, but I’m the same
I haven’t changed a bit, haven’t changed a bit I’m Trapped I’m Trapped
I’m Trapped Oh- I’m Trapped Yeah-

I wanna move on (wanna move on)
Why you make it so hard? (make it so hard)
For me to let go (need to let go)
Every time that you call (Every time that you call)

And I’m losing it I find my inner self, try to stay true to it
Gotta make a way out, ‘cause you ain’t true to me, ain’t true to me, I’m Trapped I’m Trapped
And now you’re losing me We had a future and a plan
But you don’t stick to it You have changed, but I’m the same
I haven’t changed a bit, haven’t changed a bit I’m Trapped I’m Trapped

And I’m losing it I find my inner self, try to stay true to it
Gotta make a way out, ‘cause you ain’t true to me, ain’t true to me, I’m Trapped I’m Trapped
And now you’re losing me We had a future and a plan
But you don’t stick to it You have changed, but I’m the same
I haven’t changed a bit, haven’t changed a bit I’m Trapped I’m Trapped

I’m Trapped Oh- Ooh- Ooh-
