                        Bài hát: Cry Me A River - Julie London

Now you say, you're lonely
You cry the whole night through
Well, you can cry me a river, cry me a river
I cried a river over you

Now you say, you're sorry
For bein' so untrue
Well, you can cry me a river, cry me a river
I cried a river over you

You drove me, nearly drove me out of my head
While you never shed a tear
Remember, I remember all that you said
Told me love was too plebeian
Told me you were through with me and

Now you say, you love me
Well, just to prove you do
Come on and cry me a river, cry me a river
I cried a river over you

I cried a river over you
I cried a river over you
I cried a river over you
