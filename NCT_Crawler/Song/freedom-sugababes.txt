                        I like the lights when they hit your face
 You're as good as blind, it blackens out your gaze
 And we're on fire but I'm too caught in you to care Let's walk away into the night
 It's getting late but we're right on time
 You and I wanna be nameless for a little while So raise your hand, one fist in the air
 For freedom
 For being alive, not having a care
 For freedom
 'Cause tonight is the night
 Where we break the speed of light
 So stand up, come alive
 Liberate yourself 'cause freedom starts tonight Stand up, stand up, stand up, stand up
 Stand up, stand up, stand up, stand up I love the night, the way it covers us
 You're acting shy, but you're curious
 Let's play with fire cos we're too deep in this to care So raise your hand, one fist in the air
 For freedom
 For being alive, not having a care
 For freedom
 'Cause tonight is the night
 Where we break the speed of light
 So stand up, come alive
 Liberate yourself 'cause freedom starts tonight Stand up, stand up, stand up, stand up
 Stand up, stand up, stand up, stand up Freedom!
 Tonight, tonight we're gonna live our lives
 Tonight, tonight we're gonna live our lives Say freedom!
 Freedom!
 Freedom!
 So raise your hand!
 Freedom! So raise your hand, one fist in the air
 For freedom
 For being alive, not having a care
 For freedom
 'Cause tonight is the night
 Where we break the speed of light
 So stand up, come alive
 Liberate yourself 'cause freedom starts tonight Stand up, stand up, stand up, stand up
 Stand up, stand up, stand up, stand up
 Freedom!
