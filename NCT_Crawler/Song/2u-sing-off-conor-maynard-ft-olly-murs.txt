[Justin Timberlake - Cry Me a River] - Conor
You were my sun, you were my Earth
You didn't know all the ways I loved you, no

[Passenger - Let Her Go] - Olly
You only need the light when it's burning low
Only miss the sun when it starts to snow
You only know you love her when you let her go ohh
And you let her go

[The Chainsmokers - Don’t Let Me Down] - Conor
I need you, I need you, I need you right now
Yeah, I need you right now

Yeah, I knew you were trouble when you walked in, oh

[Bruno Mars - Locked Out of Heaven] - Conor
Cause your sex takes me to paradise
Yeah, your sex takes me to paradise

It's the remix to ignition
Hot and fresh out the kitchen
Mama rolling that body got every man in here wishing

With us two in the middle

[John Legend -All of Me] - Olly
All of me loves all of you
All your curves and all your edges
All your perfect imperfections

[Zedd ft. Foxes - Clarity] - Conor
If our love is tragedy why are you my remedy?
If our love's insanity why are you my clarity?

[Jack U ft. Justin Bieber - Where Are U Now] - Olly
I gave you the key when the door wasn't open
Just admit it
See I gave you faith, turned your doubt into hoping, can't deny it

All the taste of your lips, I'm on a ride
You're toxic, I'm slipping under

[Amy Winehouse - Rehab] - Olly
They tried to make me go to rehab but I said no, no, no

[Usher - Confessions, Pt. II] - Conor
These are my confessions
Just when I thought I said all I could say
My chick on the side said she got one on the way
These are my confessions
Man I'm thrown and I don't know what to do
I guess I gotta give part two of my confessions

[Macklemore & Ryan Lewis - Can’t Hold Us ft.Ray Dalton] - Olly
Can we go back? This is the moment
Tonight is the night, we'll fight till it's over
So we put our hands up 
Like the ceiling can't hold us
Like the ceiling can't hold us

[Jack U ft. Justin Bieber - Where Are U Now] - Conor
Where are you now that I need ya?

Gotye ft. Kimbra - Somebody That I Used to Know - Olly
But you didn't have to cut me off
Make out like it never happened and that we were nothing
And I don't even need your love
But you treat me like a stranger and that feels so rough

[Nickelback - Rockstar] - Conor
'Cause we all just wanna be big rockstars
Live in hilltop houses 
Driving fifteen cars
The girls come easy and the drugs come cheap
We'll all stay skinny 'cause we just won't eat and we'll

[Nickelback - Rockstar] - Olly 
Hey hey I wanna be a rockstar, hey

I left my girl back home
I don't love her no more

Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife

[Jay Z - Holy Grail ft.Justin Timberlake] - Olly
You'd took the clothes off my back and I'd let you

[David Guetta ft. Justin Bieber - 2U] - Conor, Olly
When it comes to you
Don't be blind
Watch me speak from my heart
When it comes to you
Comes to you
