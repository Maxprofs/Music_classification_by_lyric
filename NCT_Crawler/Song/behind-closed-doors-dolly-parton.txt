                        My baby makes me proud, Lord, don't he make me proud
 He never makes a scene by hanging all over me in a crowd
 'Cause people like to talk, Lord, don't they love to talk
 But when they turn out the lights I know he'll be leaving with me And when we get behind closed doors
 Then we let our hair hang down
 And he makes me glad I'm a girl
 Oh, no one knows what goes behind closed doors My baby makes me smile, Lord, don't he make me smile
 I'm never far away or too tired to say I want to
 I'm purring like a kitten when he's out in public with me
 But when they turn out the lights he brings out the tiger in me And when we get behind closed doors
 We can let our hair hang down
 And he makes me glad that he's my man
 Oh and no one knows what goes behind closed doors
 Behind closed doors
                        
                    |
