                        Bài hát: Show Me Your Heart (Hoa Nào Anh Quên) - V.A

Just can't tonight how I feel 
Just can't tonight loving you 
Missing you every day 
Loving you every way 
I just can't stop loving you my dear 

Just can't tonight how I feel 
Just can't tonight loving you 
Since that day I meet you 
My dreams began saw you 
I just can't stop thinking about you 

Oh baby won't you open your heart 
How were you let me inside to your heart 
Account miss out be true 
Account miss out be good 
I'll never let you down 

Oh baby won't you show me your heart 
You know I get inside your heart some how 
Account miss out be true 
Account miss out be good 
I'll never let you down
                        
                    |
