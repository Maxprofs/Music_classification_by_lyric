                        Close your eyes
Give me your hand, Darling
Do you feel my heart beating?
Do you understand?
Do you feel the same?
Am I only dreaming?
Is this burning an eternal flame?

I believe it's meant to be, Darling
I watch you when you are sleeping
You belong with me
Do you feel the same?
Am I only dreaming?
Or is this burning an eternal flame?

Say my name
Sun shines through the rain
My whole life so lonely
You come and ease the pain
I don't wanna lose this feeling

Ooooh...



Say my name

Sun shines through the rain

My whole life so lonely

You come and ease the pain

I don't wanna lose this feeling

Oooh...
