                        If you go away on the summer day
 Then you might as well take the sun away
 All the birds that flew in the summer sky When our love was new and our hearts were high
 When the day was young and the night was long
 And the moon stood still for the night birds song If you go away, if you go away
 If you go away, if you go away But if you stay, Ill make you a day
 Like no day has been, or will be again
 Well sail the sun, well ride on the rain Well talk to the trees, worship the wind
 Then if you go, Ill understand
 Leave me just enough love to fill up my hand If you go away, if you go away
 If you go away, if you go away If you go away, as I know you must
 Therell be nothing left in the world to trust
 Just an empty room, full of empty space Like the empty look I see on your face
 Id have been the shadow of your dog
 If I thought it might have kept me by your side If you go away, if you go away
 If you go away, please, dont go away
