                        Bài hát : Lady Of Dreams - Kitaro

Save me a place in the heart of your hearts
When you think of love never forsake me
Wanting and dreaming you each time I think of you
Lying naked beside me

Only a lady of dreams
She will bring magic to sing to your heartstrings
Only a lady of dreams
Come alive, you are all that I desire

Save me a place in the heart of your hearts
When you think of dreams, never forsake me
Wanting and holding you
Each time I think of you lying naked beside you

Only a lady of dreams
She will bring magic to sing to your heartstrings
Only a lady of dreams
Come alive, you are all that I desire

Something tells me, this is love that surrounds
Only a fool without wisdom can see
Blind as I am, in your eyes
My lady of dreams
Blind as I am, in your eyes
My lady of dreams

Save me, save me a place in your heart
Tears escape from me when we're apart
Please dream of me now
My lady of dreams

My thought and wishes are all that surrounds
Mysteries hold you, then fly you away
You know you are my life, my lady of dreams
You know you are my life, my lady of dreams

Save me a place in the heart of your heart
When you think of love, never forsake me
Wanting and dreaming you
Each time I think of you lying naked beside me

Only a lady of dreams
She would bring magic to sing to your heartstrings
Only a lady of dreams
Come alive, you are all that I desire

Something tells me, this is love that surrounds
Only a fool without wisdom can see
Blind as I am, in your eyes
My lady of dreams
Blind as I am, in your eyes
My lady of dreams
                        
                    |
