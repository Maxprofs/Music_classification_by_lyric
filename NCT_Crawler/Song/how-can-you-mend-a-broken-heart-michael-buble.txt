                        Bài hát: How Can You Mend A Broken Heart - Michael Buble

I can think of younger days
when living for my life
Was everything a man could want to do
I could never see tomorrow
but I was never told about the sorrow
And how can you mend a broken heart?
How can you stop the rain from falling down?
How can you stop the sun from shining?
What makes the world go round?
How can you mend this broken man?
How can a loser ever win?
Please help me mend my broken heart
and let me live again
I can still feel the breeze 
that rustles through the trees
And misty memories of days gone by
I could never see tomorrow
no onesay a word about the sorrow
and how can you mend a broken heart?
How can you stop the rain from falling down?
How can you stop the sun from shining?
What makes the world go round?
How can you mend this broken man?
How can a loser ever win?
Please help me mend my broken heart
and let me live again
lala...lalalala
Please help me mend my broken heart
and let me live again
