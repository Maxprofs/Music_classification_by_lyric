                        Bài hát : The Duck Dynasty Song 
Ca sĩ : Amanda Ryan

Phil started it all with a duck call
millionaires with lots of hair
If you dont live on the land
you aint a real man
Cooking is the way to a man's heart
can live off love or you will starve
yeah
Willie's known as the CEO
boss hog in camoflauge
Got lots of trucks and fancy bass boats
wheres a bandana where ever he goes
Somedays he wants to fire his family
running wild cant seem to get them working
Duck Dynasty makes me so happy happy happy
Phil would be so proud of me
I aint a yuppie
got a finale every wednesday on A&E
We watch Duck Dynasty
Duck Dynasty
Jase is filling up the loading dock
testing out the duck calls
Cuts roadkill tails just to get 5 bucks
but all he wants to do is kill ducks
catches bull frogs n' crawfish
sunk his before he started
yeah
Uncle Si and his tea glass
you hide it from him and he will get mad
momma sent it to him in veitnam
and hes got it today
but when a beaver dances
he sips a gallon of iced tea
Its a must have cause its so refreshing
Duck Dynasty makes me so happy happy happy
Phil would be so proud of me
I aint a yuppie
got a finale every wednesday on A&E
We watch Duck Dynasty
yeah
Duck Dynasty
Wether the storm or fear the beard
the Robertsons are here
They're coming in its just a matter of time cause
If it flies dies
The beards are back
Duck Dynasty makes me so happy happy happy
Phil would be so proud of me
I aint a yuppie
got a finale every wednesday on A&E yeah
every wednesday on A&E
We watch Duck Dynasty
Duck Dynasty
