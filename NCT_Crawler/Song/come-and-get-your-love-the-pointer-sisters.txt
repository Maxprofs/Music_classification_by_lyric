                        Bài hát: Come And Get Your Love - The Pointer Sisters

How long must I sit around waiting for you
Think of all the heartache you've been putting me though
You must have a soul, but it don't show.
Come on and love me or let me go
Or come and get your love
(Get your love)
Come and get your love
(Get your love)
Come and get your love
(Get your love)
Come and get your love
(Get your love)
Come and get your love,
Before I give it away.
Come and get it.

You're a devil witch and I'm hypnotized
But woman I can see right through your eyes.
Here's something for you, take it from me.
Why don't you love me or set me free
Or come and get your love
(Get your love)
Come and get your love
(Get your love)
Come and get your love
(Get your love)
Come and get your love
(Get your love)
Come and get your love,
Before I give it away.

I've been holding on to your love for so long.
Could be I will tire of the face I admire.
So why don't you say just go away.
Or come and get your love
(Get your love)
Come and get your love
(Get your love)
Come and get your love
(Get your love)
Come and get your love
(Get your love)
Come and get your love
Before I give it away.
