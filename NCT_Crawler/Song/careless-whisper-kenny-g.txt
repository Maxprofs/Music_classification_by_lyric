                        Bài hát: Careless Whisper - Kenny G 

I feel so unsure,
As I take your hand and lead you to the dance floor.
As the music dies, 
Something in your eyes,
Calls to mind the silver screen,
And all its sad goodbyes.

CHORUS
I'm never gonna dance again,
Guilty feet have got no rhythm.
Though it's easy to pretend,
I know you're not a fool.
I should have known better than to cheat a friend,
And waste the chance that I'd been given.
So I'm never gonna dance again,
The way I danced with you.

Time can never mend,
The careless whispers of a good friend.
To the heart and mind,
Ignorance is kind.
There's no comfort in the truth,
Pain is the heart you'll fight.

CHORUS
I'm never gonna dance again,
Guilty feet have got no rhythm.
Though it's easy to pretend,
I know you're not a fool.
I should have known better than to cheat a friend,
And waste the chance that I'd been given.
So I'm never gonna dance again,
The way I danced with you.

Tonight the music seems so loud,
I wish that we could lose this crowd.
Maybe it's better this way,
We'd hurt each other with the things we want to say.

We could have been so good together,
We could have lived this dance forever.
But now, who's gonna dance with me?
Please stay.

CHORUS
And I'm never gonna dance again,
Guilty feet have got no rhythm.
Though it's easy to pretend,
I know you're not a fool.
I should have known better than to cheat a friend,
And waste the chance that I'd been given.
So I'm never gonna dance again,
The way I danced with you.

Now that you're gone (Now that you're gone) 
Now that you're gone
Was what I did so wrong?
So wrong, that you had to leave me alone?
                        
                    |
