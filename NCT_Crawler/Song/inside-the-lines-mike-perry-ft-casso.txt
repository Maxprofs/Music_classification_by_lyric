                        Bài hát: Inside The Lines - Mike Perry, Casso

Worried sky, in need of something green to sleep at night
Aiming high, we're living restless but it's you and I

Can see we are, the shade, defining [?]
True work of art, is not, a thing we change
Aiming high,
We're living restless but it's you and I

Tried to keep our colours,
Inside the lines, insides the lines
But it's hard to draw emotions,
In troubled minds, inside the lines

Bold and brave, compared to others we just paint them grey,
Here to stay, know that the two of us won't fade away,

Can see we are, the shade, defining [?]
True work of art, is not a thing we change,
Hard to hide,
Illumine like the moon that pulls the tide

Tried to keep our colours,
Inside the lines, inside the lines,
But it's hard to draw emotions,
In troubled minds, inside the lines
                        
                    |
