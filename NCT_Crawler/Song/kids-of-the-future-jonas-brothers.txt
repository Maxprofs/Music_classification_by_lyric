                        [All Together]
 We're the kids
 We're the kids
 We're the kids of the future [x2] [Joe]
 Standing on a dirty, old rooftop
 Down below the cars in the city go rushing by
 I sit here alone and I wonder why Come on Lewis, keep moving forward
 Hold your head up high
 There's no time for looking down
 You will not believe where we're going now [Nick]
 Here we go,let me remind you
 Look ahead,the past is behind you [Chorus]
 We're the kids of the future, Whoa!
 We're the kids of the future, Whoa!
 Everybody lives'cause the future is Now! (Echo)Now,Now,Now,Now,Now,Now,Now [Joe]
 Bright lights,boy,look around you
 Your imagination is working overtime
 The world that you've dreamt of has now arrived Hot shot, the greatest adventure
 Is where the family you've searched for
 Comes alive
 So come meet the Robinsons [Nick]
 Looking for a place you belong to
 Looking for a family that wants you [Chorus]
 We're the kids of the future,Whoa!(x2)
 Everybody live 'cause the future is now! Na,na,na,na-na-na-na,
 na,na,na,na-na-na Na,na,na,na-na-na-na, (Yell) SING!
 na,na,na,na-na-na

 Everyday we have fun me and Wilbur
 So happy to be here with the Robinsons
 I finally feel I can be someone Outside a new day is dawning
 Outside TodayLand is rawling everywhere
 I know that it's right because [Nick]
 We'll save the future together
 This family's forever [Chorus]
 We're the kids of the future,Whoa!(x2)
 Everybody live 'cause the future is now! Na,na,na,na-na-na-na,
