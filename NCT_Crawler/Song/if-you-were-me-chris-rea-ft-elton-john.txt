                        If you were me and I was you
 If you had to play my part out, what would you do?
 Two crazy stories, two different views
 If you were me and I was you If you were me and I was you
 What kind of crazy things would I have to do?
 Who likes to party, who stays at home
 If you were me and I was you Never like strangers, though never the same
 Two circus sideshows that laughed in the rain
 You stayed with the full moon, you searched for the stars
 Thank God in His heaven, here we both are If you were me and I was you
 If you had to play my part out, what would you do?
 Two crazy stories, two different views
 If you were me, if you were me, if you were me and I was you If you were me and I was you
 If you were me and I was you
