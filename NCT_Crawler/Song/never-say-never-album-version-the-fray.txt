                        [Verse 1]
 Some things we don't talk about 
 Rather do without
 And just hold the smile
 Falling in and out of love
 Same damn problem
 Together all the while

 [Chorus]
 You can never say never
 Why we don't know when
 Time and time again
 Younger now than we were before

 Don't let me go
 Don't let me go
 Don't let me go
 [X2]

 [Verse 2]
 Picture you're the queen of everything
 As far as the eye can see
 Under your command
 I will be your guardian
 When all is crumbling
 Steady your hands

 [Chorus]
 You can never say never
 Why we don't know when
 Time, time and time again
 Younger now than we were before

 Don't let me go
 Don't let me go
 Don't let me go
 [X2]

 [Bridge]
 We're pulling apart and coming together again and again
 We're growing apart but we pull it together, pull it together, together again

 [Outro]
 Don't let me go
 Don't let me go
 Don't let me go
 [X4]
                        
                    |
