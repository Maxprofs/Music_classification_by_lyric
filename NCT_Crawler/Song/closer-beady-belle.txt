                        Closer
 Come a little closer
 Lend an ear to my secretive, whispering, quiet word

 Closer
 Still a little closer
 What I tell you must in no case go unheard

 Delicate, delicate
 Clandestine, devoted, forbidden sense
 Intimate, intimate
 Mysterious, mutual confidence

 Closer
 Just a little closer
 Don't worry, there's no danger, no offence

 Closer
 Still a little closer
 And you'll see my message is simply self-evidence
