                        There’s a zombie on your lawn Lyrics:
There’s a zombie on your lawn
There’s a zombie on your lawn
There’s a zombie on your lawn
We don’t want zombies on the lawn

I know your type: tall, dark, and dead
You want to bite all the petals off of my head
And then eat the brains of
the one who planted me here

I’m just a sunflower but see
me power an entire infantry
You like the taste of brains
we don’t like zombies

I used to play football
Road cones protect my head
I have a screen-door shield
We are the undead

Maybe it’s time to reevaluate
I know you have a lot of food on your plate
Brains are quite rich in cholesterol

You’re dead so it doesn’t matter,
Instead we’ll use this solar power
to make a lawn defense at any hour

I like the tricycle
There’s butter on my head
I’m gonna eat your brains
                        
                    |
