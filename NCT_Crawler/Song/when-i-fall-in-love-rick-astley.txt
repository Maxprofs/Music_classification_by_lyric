...
When i fall in love 
...
if will be forever
...
or i'll never fall in lovein 
...
a restless world like this is
...
love is ended before it's begun
...
and too many 
moonlight kisses
...
seem to cool 
in the warmth of the sun
...
When i give my heart 
...
it will be completely
...
or i'll never give my heart
...
and the moment 
I can feel that 
you feel that way too
...
is when i fall in love with you...
