                        Bài hát: So Far Away (8D Audio) - Suga (BTS), Jin (BTS), Jung Kook (BTS)

Light 'em up, light 'em up 
Tell me where you are, tell me where you are 
Summer nights, bright lights 
And the shooting stars, they break my heart 

Calling you now, but you're not picking up 
Shadows so close if that's still enough 
Light a match, light a match 
Baby, in the dark, show me where you are 

Oh, love 
How I miss you every single day 
When I see you on those streets 
Oh, love 
Tell me there's a river I can swim that will bring you back to me 
'Cause I don't know how to love someone else 
I don't know how to forget your face 
Oh, love 
God, I miss you every single day and now you're so far away 
So far away 

It's breaking me, losing you 
We were far from perfect 
But we were worth it 
Too many fights, and we cried 
But never said we're sorry 
Stop saying you love me
You're calling me now, but I can't pick up 
Your shadow's still close, and I'm still in love 
The summer's over now 
But somehow it still breaks my heart 
We could have had this talk 
Oh 

Oh, love 
How I miss you every single day 
When I see you on those streets 
Oh, love 
Tell me there's a river I can swim that will bring you back to me 
'Cause I don't know how to love someone else 
I don't know how to forget your face 
Oh, love 
God, I miss you every single day and now you're so far away 

So far away 
So far away, oh 
So far away 
So far away

Oh, love 
How I miss you every single day 
When I see you on those streets 
Oh, love 
Tell me there's a river I can swim that will bring you back to me 
'Cause I don't know how to love someone else 
I don't know how to forget your face 
Oh, love 
God, I miss you every single day and now you're so far away
                        
                    |
