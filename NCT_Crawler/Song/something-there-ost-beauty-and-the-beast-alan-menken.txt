                        Bài hát: Something There (OST Beauty And The Beast) - Alan Menken

Belle:
There's something sweet
And almost kind
But he was mean and he was co * and unrefined
But now he's dear, and so unsure
I wonder why I didn't see it there before

Beast:
She glanced this way
I thought I saw
And when we touched she didn't shudder at my paw
No it can't be, I'll just ignore
But then she's never looked at me that way before

Belle:
New and a bit alarming
Who'd have ever thought that this could be?
True that he's no Prince Charming
But there's something in him that I simply didn't see

Lumiere:
Well, who'd have thought?
Mrs Potts:
Well, bless my soul
Cogsworth:
Well, who'd have known?
Mrs Potts:
Well, who indeed?
Lumiere:
And who'd have guessed they'd come together on their own?
Mrs Potts:
It's so peculiar. Wait and see
Lumiere and Cogsworth:
We'll wait and see
All three:
A few days more
There may be something there that wasn't there before
Cogsworth:
Perhaps there's something there
That wasn't there before
