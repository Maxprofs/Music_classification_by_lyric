                        You are not alone ooh ooh

Let's go outside
There's something beautiful to see
Go outside
Where there's room to breathe
Let's find somewhere
Where we can talk it over
I'm on your side...

When your heart is hurting
When nothing is workin'
Let me through the door
Cause I've been there before
When your world is shaking
And your energy is fading
Just let me through the door
Cause I've been there before

You are not alone ooh ooh
You are not alone ooh ooh
We're just human

On the inside
I am you and you are me
On the inside
The scars no one could see
We're all hurting
There's no one new to this,
Oh turn to me, turn...

When your heart is hurting
When nothing is workin'
Let me through the door
Cause I've been there before
When your world is shaking
And your energy is fading
Just let me through the door
Cause I've been there before

You are not alone ooh ooh
You are not alone ooh ooh
We're just human
You are not alone ooh ooh
You are not alone alone alone
Human human human

We are all, all the same
We are human human human human
Different faces, different names
We are human human human human
We can never be replaced
We are human human human human
We are all, all the same

When your heart is hurting
When nothing is workin'
Let me through the door
Cause I've been there before
When your world is shaking
And your energy is fading
Just let me through the door
Cause I've been there before

When your heart is hurting
When nothing is workin'
Let me through the door
Cause I've been there before
When your world is shaking
And your energy is fading
Just let me through the door
Cause I've been there before

You are not alone ooh ooh
We're just human
You are not alone ooh ooh
We're just human
You are not alone ooh ooh
We're just human
You are not alone ooh ooh
We're just human
