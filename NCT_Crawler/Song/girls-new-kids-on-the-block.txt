                        I like what you know, I like what you show
 No doubt about it, I wanna be where you go
 I wouldnt change it or try to explain it
 Some guys can be with girls and wind up complainin'
 But I wouldnt if I could Im not that kind of yesterday
 A mood swing serious
 Its just sauce for the goods
 I dont even want to figure it out
 Im too busy thinkin about you Girls, where would boys be without girls to love?
 You know that Id be with you girls
 Where would boys be without girls to love
 Sweet love What would I do without someone like you?
 Without your sexy smile, those ways wont cramp my style
 But you made me sweat when you played hard to get
 One kiss from your lips though and I forget Thats how you make me feel on the real to real
 All I wanna do is be true to you
 Dont need the loneliness, to hell with phoniness
 I would never leave love out because Im all about you, girl Girls, where would boys be without girls to love?
 You know that Id be with you girls
 Where would boys be without girls to love
 Sweet love Can live with 'em
 Can live with 'em
 Cant live without girls You got me sweatin', cant ya tell?
 Without perfume I love your natural smell
 Others wont say that, they like to front
 'Cause if they aint one way then the girls a skunk
 But you can be yourself, come and chill a while
 Do your own thing, it wont cramp my style And Ill be there goin right with the flow
 Yeah I know and also love the way you show
 Your innocent side, your straight up side
 Look we can make you work without the foolish pride
 And where would I be without my girl?
 You know it really doesnt matter, wouldnt trade her for the world Girls, where would boys be without girls to love?
 You know that Id be with you girls
 Where would boys be without girls to love
 Sweet love I like the things you know, I like the things you show
 I wanna be where you go
 Makin me want you, all the things you do
 I speak for whatever you do Girls, where would boys be without girls to love?
 You know that Id be with you girls
 Where would boys be without girls to love
 Sweet love
