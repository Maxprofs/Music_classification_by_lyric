                        It doesn't matter what I say, don't matter what I do
 Every little thing reminds me of you
 It gets harder every day, I don't know what to do
 Every little thing reminds me of you Reminds me of you, reminds me of you, reminds me of you (repeats) Yes, party people, we drop and feet go, some make your fist-pump, hands up and feet go
 Crazy, look at all these ladies, tonight is going down
 We party rockin in this place for sure, every place that we walk in is the place to go
 Popping bottles up for free, with the models every week
 Sexy go-gos the way you booty bubbles to the beat is like...
 Owning, popping, ain't no stopping, the bass is knockin
 Them shots are dropping, some of us came to celebrate
 But most of us came to get away It doesn't matter what I say, don't matter what I do
 Every little thing reminds me of you
 It gets harder every day, I don't know what to do
 Every little thing reminds me of you I'm a heavyweight, light on my feet, must levitate
 Sexy tape, must for penetrate, then I slap you in the ass with the resume
 I'm leaving with the finer things, designer draws, dollar rings
 Go to the monica, lots of things, I stay the same, call the packing chains
 Big bro chains, I never ever being a bitch, my last girl was, so player switched
 Pop the only ricky, cuz im rich, that's the only...my booty call it
 Yeah, ...but she still ride my banana boat, she still ride my banana boat Now new nick name is banana throat, figure it out
 I'm the one everybody here about, man you're just here for now
 So settle down, the .... is flow, you hear me now
 I'm always up to something, I got goon in the house cuz he my cousin
 We got dollars by the dozens, but without you girl i'm nothing Everybody's on the floor, I can see your hands up
 From the stage to the ...
 Calvin harris on the deck
 LMFAO's on the checks
 We're the two in the place to be
 The place to be, what's hapenning next
 Baby you look so fine, I can tell that look in you eye
 That mean me and you in the back room
 What cross your mind, i'll bucket chain on my chest
 Cuz i'm fresh to the death
 And everyday i'm shuffling, i'm like a soldier with these steps It's only popping, that ain't no stopping
 That place is knocking, the shots are dropping
 Some of us came to celebrate, but most of us came to get away It doesn't matter what I say, don't matter what I do
 Every little thing reminds me of you
 It gets harder every day, I don't know what to do
 Every little thing reminds me of you Reminds me of you, reminds me of you, reminds me of you (repeats)
