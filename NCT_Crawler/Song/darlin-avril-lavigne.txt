[00:-1.00]Avril Lavigne - Darlin'

Darlin'
You're hiding in the closet once again
Start smilin'

I know you're tryin'
Real hard not to turn your head away
Pretty darlin'
Face tomorrow, tomorrow's not yesterday
Yesterday
Oh, oh

Pretty please
I know it's a drag
Wipe your eyes and put up your head
I wish you could be happy instead
There's nothing else I can do
But love you the best that I can
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Darlin'
I was there once a while ago
I know, that it's hard
To be stuck with people that you love
When nobody trusts

Pretty please
I know it's a drag (know it's a drag)
Wipe your eyes and put up your head (put up your head)
I wish you could be happy instead
There's nothing else I can do
But love you the best that I can
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
That I can
Oh...

You're not the only one who's been through it
I've been there alone and now so are you
I just want you to know, want you to know it's not your fault
It's not your fault
Oh, oh
Your fault, your fault
It's not your fault
Your fault, your fault, your fault

Pretty please
I know it's a drag
Wipe your eyes and put up your head
I wish you could be happy instead
There's nothing else I can do
But love you the best that I can
Pretty please
I know it's a drag
Wipe your eyes and put up your head
I wish you could be happy instead
There's nothing else I can do
But love you the best that I can
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
That I can
Oh...

Darlin'
You're hiding in the closet once again
Start smilin'
