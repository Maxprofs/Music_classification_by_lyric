                        Bài hát: Boomerang - Nicole Scherzinger

The world spit me out, 
And now we’re spinning around, 
Lost in a free fall. 

Forever going down, 
And breaking through the ground, 
When I thought I reached the end, 
I start to fall again. 

Pre-chorus: 
But I was taught, 
To never surrender, 
When it’s hard to get up, 
Gonna fight ’til I can stand and say. 

Chorus: 
Oh, you can turn me down, 
You can throw me now, 
The harder out, the harder I come back around. 
You can break my heart, 
But you can’t scratch my name, 
I can take the hit cause I’m a boomerang. 
Oh, woah, oh woah, oh woah I’m a boomerang. 
Oh, woah, oh woah, oh woah I’m a boomerang. 

Now I’m 10 feet tall, 
All my problems feel so small, 
Nothing in my way to make me change, 
No ceiling to my sky, 
Just open space to fly, 
Everytime I’m feeling down, 
I turn it back around. 


Pre-chorus: 
But I was taught, 
To never surrender, 
When it’s hard to get up, 
Gonna fight ’til I can stand and say. 

Chorus: 
Oh, you can turn me down, 
You can throw me now, 
The harder out, the harder I come back around. 
You can break my heart, 
But you can’t scratch my name, 
I can take the hit cause I’m a boomerang. 
Oh, woah, oh woah, oh woah I’m a boomerang. 
Oh, woah, oh woah, oh woah I’m a boomerang. 

Even though I’m flying high, 
The sky can change one day, 
I can hit some turbulence, 
But who I am is never gonna change, 
Cause I’m a boomerang. 
Cause I’m a boomerang. 
Cause I’m a boomerang. 

Chorus: 
Oh, you can turn me down, 
You can throw me now, 
The harder out, the harder I come back around. 
You can break my heart, 
But you can’t scratch my name, 
I can take the hit cause I’m a boomerang. 
Oh, woah, oh woah, oh woah I’m a boomerang. 
Oh, woah, oh woah, oh woah I’m a boomerang.
