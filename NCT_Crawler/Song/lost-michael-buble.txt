Âu Mỹ khác|

                        I can\'t believe it\'s over
 I watched the whole thing fall
 And I never saw the writing that was on the wall
 If I\'d only knew
 The days were slipping past
 That the good things never last
 That you were crying

Summer turned to winter
 And the snow it turned to rain
 And the rain turned into tears upon your face
 I hardly recognize the girl you are today
 And God I hope it\'s not too late
 It\'s not too late

\'Cause you are not alone
 I\'m always there with you
 And we\'ll get lost together
 Until the light comes pouring through
 It\'s when you feel like you\'re done
 And the darkness has won
 Babe, you\'re not lost
 When your world\'s crashing down
 And you can\'t bear the cross
 I said, babe, you\'re not lost

Life can show no mercy
 It can tear your soul apart
 It can make you feel like you\'ve gone crazy but you\'re not
 Things have seemed to change
 There\'s one thing that\'s still the same
 In my heart you have remained
 And we can fly fly fly away

\'Cause you are not alone
 And I am there with you
 And we\'ll get lost together
 Until the light comes pouring through
 It\'s when you feel like you\'re done
 And the darkness has won
 Babe, you\'re not lost
 And the world\'s crashing down
 And you can not bear the cross
 I said, baby, you\'re not lost
 I said, baby, you\'re not lost
 I said, baby, you\'re not lost
 I said, baby, you\'re not lost
                        
                    |
