                        Bài hát: Edema Ruh - Nightwish

One by one we light the candles of the show
One by one entered a theater of the primal birth
Silently watch the planetary curtain go down
Laugh and drink joys as the powerful play greets you tonight

We are the Edema Ruh, we know the songs the sirens sang
Sea of stream, every tale true
Soon as we leave with you, we'll take you home

We've got a pick to open all of the gates
A show you will see, a starlight to drown all your cares
Mirror houses, the sweetest kisses and lights
The Debussy twilight between winter and the roaring sea

We are the Edema Ruh, we know the songs the sirens sang
Sea of stream, every tale true
Soon as we leave with you, we'll take you home

Dance to the whistle to the play to the story
To infinite encores
Laugh at the royalty with sad crowns
And hear the chorus once more

We are the Edema Ruh, we know the songs the sirens sang
Sea of stream, every tale true
Soon as we leave with you, we'll take you home
                        
                    |
