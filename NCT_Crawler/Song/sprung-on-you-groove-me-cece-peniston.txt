                        I guess you say you're in my head
 Cause you're always on my mind (24/7)
 I like to think of how we feel
 And how we take our time BRIDGE:
 Baby you make me feel so real
 So much more love than I had before
 Don't think I can take much more
 If you want me to stay with you
 Whenever you need, whenever you want me
 Baby I wanna be CHORUS:
 Baby don't you know
 That I'm sprung on you
 I can never find someone
 To groove me like you do
 Even if I searched the whole world
 I'd still come back to you
 I can never find someone
 To groove me like you do When you are near, you make my heart sing
 You help me see the joy in everything
 I never fear, no, when you are by my side
 When you hold me I'm in paradise BRIDGE
                        
                    |
