                        She, she ain't real,
She ain't gonna be able to love you like I will,
Sure, she's got it all,
But, baby, is that really what you want?
Bless your soul, you've got you're head in the clouds,
You made a fool out of you,
And, boy, she's bringing you down,
She made your heart melt,
But you're cold to the core,
Now rumour has it she ain't got your love anymore,

Rumour has it, ooh,
Rumour has it, ooh,
Rumour has it, ooh,
Rumour has it, ooh,
Rumour has it, ooh,
Rumour has it, ooh,
Rumour has it, ooh,
Rumour has it, ooh,

Don't forget me, I beg
I remember you said

I heard that you're settled down
That you found a girl and you're married now
I heard that your dreams came true
Guess she gave you things I didn't give to you

Rumour has it, ooh,
Rumour has it, ooh,
Rumour has it, ooh,
Rumour has it, ooh,
Rumour has it, ooh,
Rumour has it, ooh,
Rumour has it, ooh,
Rumour has it, ooh,

Don't forget me, I beg
I remember you said

Never mind, I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you, too

Don't forget me, I beg
I remember you said

"Sometimes it lasts in love
But sometimes it hurts instead"
Sometimes it lasts in love
But sometimes it hurts instead. Yeah...
