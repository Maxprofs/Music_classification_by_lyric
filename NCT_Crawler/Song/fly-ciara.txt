                        Bài hát: Fly - Ciara 

You know what I think?
You should just fly

If you have any feelings
Let 'em go, let 'em go
I woke up wasting your kiss
You can go, there's the door

[Pre-Hook:]
And I know that I wasn't in the picture
Tried to paint it, looking perfect
And it never worked for the both of us
I'mma let you know, now I'll let you go

[Hook:]
You should fly, for the first time in a long time
Just fly, let you go, let you go
Let you fly, for the first time in a long time
Just fly, let you go, let you go, oh

When I was at your house
I was sad, I was down
Tried to fix what we had
Didn't work, wasn't sure

[Pre-Hook]

[Hook]

Oh! Oh! Oh! [x5]

You should fly, for the first time in your own life
Just fly, let your real ambitions go
And fly, you should fly, for the first time in a long time
Just fly, fly, fly, fly
                        
                    |
