                        I'm at a payphone trying to call home
All of my change, I spent on you
Where have the times gone
Baby, it's all wrong, where are the plans we made for two

[Verse 1: Adam Levine]
Yeah, I, I know it's hard to remember
The people we used to be
It's even harder to picture
That you're not here next to me
You say it's too late to make it
But is it too late to try
And in that time that you wasted
All of our bridges burnt down

[Bridge]
I've wasted my nights
You turned out the lights
Now I'm paralyzed
Still stuck in that time when we called it love
But even the sun sets in paradise

[Hook]
I'm at a payphone trying to call home
All of my change, I spent on you
Where have the times gone
Baby, it's all wrong, where are the plans we made for two
If happy ever after did exist
I would still be holding you like this
And all those fairytales are full of *
One more f-cking love song I'll be sick

[Verse 2: Adam Levine]
You turned your back on tomorrow
Cause you forgot yesterday
I gave you my love to borrow
But just gave it away
You can't expect me to be fine
I don't expect you to care
I know I said it before
But all of our bridges burnt down

[Bridge]
I've wasted my nights
You turned out the lights
Now I'm paralyzed
Still stuck in that time when we called it love
But even the sun sets in paradise

[Hook]
I'm at a payphone trying to call home
All of my change, I spent on you
Where have the times gone
Baby, it's all wrong, where are the plans we made for two
If happy ever after did exist
I would still be holding you like this
And all those fairytales are full of *
One more f-cking love song I'll be sick
Now I'm at a payphone...

[Verse 3: Wiz Khalifa]
Man, f-ck that *
I'll be
                        
                    |
