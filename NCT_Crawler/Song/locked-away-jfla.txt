                        Bài hát: Locked Away - Adam Levine, R.City 

If I got locked away and we lost it all today 
Tell me honestly would you still love me the same 
If I showed you my flaws if I couldn’t be strong 
Tell me honestly would you still love me the same 

Right about now 
If I judge for life 
Would you stay by my side 
Or is ya going to say good-bye 
Can you tell me right now 
If I couldn’t buy you the fancy things in life 
Shawty would it be alright 
C’mon show me that you do 

Now tell me would you really ride for me (would you really ride for me) 
Baby tell me would you die for me (would you die for me) 
Would you spend your whole life with me (wassup) 
Would you be there to always hold me down (uh huh uh huh) 
Tell me would you really cry for me (would you really cry for me) 
Baby don’t lie to me (Baby don’t lie to me) 
If I didn’t have anything (wassup) 
I want to know would you stick around 

If I got locked away and we lost it all today 
Tell me honestly would you still love me the same 
If I showed you my flaws if I couldn’t be strong 
Tell me honestly would you still love me the same 

All I want is somebody real who don’t need much 
I gotta know that I can trust 
To be here when money low 
If I did not have nothing else to give but love 
Would that even be enough 
Yeah we need to know 

Now tell me would you really ride for me (would you really ride for me) 
Baby tell me would you die for me (would you die for me) 
Would you spend your whole life with me (wassup) 
Would you be there to always hold me down (uh huh uh huh) 
Tell me would you really cry for me (would you really cry for me) 
Baby don’t lie to me (Baby don’t lie to me) 
If I didn’t have anything (wassup) 
I want to know would you stick around 

If I got locked away and we lost it all today 
Tell me honestly would you still love me the same 
If I showed you my flaws if I couldn’t be strong 
Tell me honestly would you still love me the same 

Tell me tell me would you want me (want me) 
Tell me tell me would you call me (call me) 
If you knew I was all in 
Cuz I need a girl who’s always by my side 
Tell me tell me do you need me (need me) 
Tell me tell me do you love me 
Or is ya just tryin to play me 
Cuz I need a girl to hold me down for life 

[x2] 
If I got locked away and we lost it all today 
Tell me honestly would you still love me the same 
If I showed you my flaws if I couldn’t be strong 
Tell me honestly would you still love me the same 
Would you still love me the same
