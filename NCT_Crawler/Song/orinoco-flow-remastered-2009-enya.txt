Orinoco Flow
Enya
let me sail, let me sail, let the orinoco flow,
let me reach, let me beach on the shores of Tripoli.
let me sail, let me sail, let me crash upon your shore,
let me reach, let me beach far beyond the Yellow Sea.
sail away
from Bissau to Pilau -- in the shade of Avalon,
from Fiji to Tiree and the Isles of Ebony,
from Peru to Cebu hear the power of Babylon,
from Bali to Cali -- far beneath the Coral Sea.
sail away...
from the North to the South, Ebudae into Khartoum,
from the deep Sea of Clouds to the Island of the Moon,
carry me on the waves to the lands I've never been,
carry me on the waves to the lands I've never seen.
we can sail, we can sail, with the orinoco flow
sail away
we can steer, we can near with Rob Dickens at the wheel,
we can sigh, say goodbye Ross and his dependencies
we can sail, we can sail.
we can reach, we can beach on the shores of Tripoli.
from Bali to Cali -- far beneath the Coral Sea.
from Bissau to Pilau -- in the shade of Avalon,
we can reach, we can beach far beyond the Yellow Sea.
from Peru to Cebu hear the power of Babylon,
we can sail, we can sail,
sail away
