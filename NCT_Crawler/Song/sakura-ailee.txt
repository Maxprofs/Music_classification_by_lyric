                        Bài hát: Sakura - Ailee

Sakura hira hira
The leaves will flutter to the ground
It reminds me of the days when you
Were here to hold my hand
And the promises we've made along
Still keeps me hanging on
Hold me now just like other lovers

Sakura maichiru... 

Every now and then I remember when
We would ride this train together
And thought these precious moments
Would last forever
Every now and then I look back again
Every time I close my eyes and
The memories are with me
But you're not here with me

I know that is time for me to set free
But there is still an emptiness inside me
My life without you baby it's just hard for me to imagine
Odakyusen no madoni
I see those cherry blossoms
Although you're far away
I can hear you
I can feel you next to me

Sakura hira hira
The leaves will flutter to the ground
It reminds me of the days when you
Were here to hold my hand
And the promises we've made along
Still keeps me hanging on
Hold me now just like other lovers

Sakura maichiru... 

Getting over you is what I've tried to do
Can't get you out of my mind
Why can't we be together
Now the way we used to be
Talkin' to my heart trynna explain
Our love has faded away
Just like the seasons go by
And now it's here again

I know that is time for me to set free
But there is still an emptiness inside me
My life without you baby it's just hard for me to imagine
Everytime I look outside the window
I see those cherry blossoms
Although you're far away
I can hear you
I can feel you next to me

Sakura hira hira
The leaves will flutter to the ground
It reminds me of the days when you
Were here to hold my hand
And the promises we've made along
Still keeps me hanging on
Hold me now just like other lovers

Sakura maichiru... 

Sakura hira hira
The leaves will flutter to the ground
It reminds me of the days when you
Were here to hold my hand
And the promises we've made along
Still keeps me hanging on
Hold me now just like other lovers
