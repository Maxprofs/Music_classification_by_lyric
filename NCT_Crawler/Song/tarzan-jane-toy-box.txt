                        Deep in the jungle in the land of adventure lives Tarzan 
I am Tarzan from jungle you can be my friend 
I am Jane and I love to ride an elephant 

My name is Tarzan I am jungle man 
The tree tops swinger from jungle land 
Come baby come I will take you for a swing 
Let's go honey I'm tinkeling 

Tarzan is handsome Tarzan is strong 
He's really cute and his hair is long 
Tarzan is handsome Tarzan is strong 
So listen to the jungle song 

I am Tarzan from jungle you can be my friend 
I am Jane and I love to ride an elephant 

When you touch me I feel funny 
I feel it too when you're touching me 
Come to my tree house to my party 
Yes I'll go if you carry me
