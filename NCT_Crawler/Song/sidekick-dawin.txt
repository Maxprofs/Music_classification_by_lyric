We love golden chains, we love diamond rings
We could always gain them designer things
Versace, Prada, Rolex or Mercedes Benz
The grind will never end, oh

Got my eyes on the prize, but it won't mean much
Without you by my side
Yeah, we all fantasize 'bout our cash going up
But your love ain't got a price

With you, I'm tryna kick it, kick it, kick it
With you, I wanna kick it, kick it, kick it
'Cause you turn up my spirit, spirit, spirit
Let's take the script and flip it, flip it
Flip this, flip this thing up

Yeah, we flip this thing up
Kick it, kick it, kick it
With you, I wanna kick it, kick it, kick it
'Cause you turn up my spirit, spirit, spirit
Let's take the script and flip it, flip it

We love traveling, we love catching flights
We'll do anything to be in paradise
Ibiza or Bahamas just to live the life
But it's you that makes me feel alive

Got my eyes on the prize, but it won't mean much
Without you by my side
Yeah, we all fantasize 'bout our cash going up
But your love ain't got a price

With you, I'm tryna kick it, kick it, kick it
With you, I wanna kick it, kick it, kick it
'Cause you turn up my spirit, spirit, spirit
Let's take the script and flip it, flip it
Flip this, flip this thing up

Yeah, we flip this thing up
Kick it, kick it, kick it
With you, I wanna kick it, kick it, kick it
Spirit, spirit, spirit
Let's take the script and flip it, flip it

If I ever played 'em on the lotto
I'd still want you with me here tomorrow
Lead me to your love and I would follow
Then I'll be a winner wherever I go

Kick it, kick it, kick it
With you, I wanna kick it, kick it, kick it
'Cause you turn up my spirit, spirit, spirit
Let's take the script and flip it, flip it
