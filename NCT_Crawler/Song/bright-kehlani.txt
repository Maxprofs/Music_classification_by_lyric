                        Bài hát: Bright - Kehlani

[Verse 1]
Little girl, watching her reflection
As she parts her curls into four sections
She says, "I don't look like them, I don't look like her"
"And I don't want what's on my head"
But baby girl don't be misled (Yeah, yeah)
Young woman reading magazines
Thinking to herself, nobody looks like me
Oh I've got all these curves, all this nerve
Why can't I keep a man?
But baby girl if you love yourself you can

[Chorus 1]
Can't nobody love somebody
That do not love themselves
You are what you choose to be
It's not up to no one else
So be great, be kind
Don't let them dim your light
A woman like the sun should always stay bright

[Verse 2]
Little boy sitting in the bleachers
Staring at, at his dirty sneakers
Thinking my shoes don't shine
Money is tight, I would never get a date
But baby boy that's not what it takes
Young man, always at the center
Finding ways to make his arms look bigger
Saying, "You see those guys?"
"They get all the girls, I just want to be like them"
But baby boy, you're spreading yourself thin

[Chorus 2]
Can't nobody love somebody
That do not love themselves
You are what you choose to be
It's not up to no one else
So be great, be kind
Don't let them dim your light
Cause a man like the sun should always stay bright

[Outro]
Yes, you are like the sun so always stay bright
                        
                    |
