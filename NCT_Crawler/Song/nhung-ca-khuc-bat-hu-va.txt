                        25 Minutes 

After some time I've finally made up my mind 
She is the girl and I really want to make her mine 
I'm searching everywhere to find her again to tell her I love her 
and I'm sorry about the things I've done 

I find her standing in front of the church 
the only place in town where I didn't search 
She looks so happy in her wedding-dress 
but she's crying while she's saying this 

Chorus: 
Boy I've missed your kisses all the time but this is 
twenty five minutes too late 
Though you traveled so far boy I'm sorry your are 
twenty-five minutes too late 

Against the wind I'm going home again 
wishing me back to the time when we were more than friends 

But still I see her in front of the church 
the only place in town where I didn't search 
She looked so happy in her wedding-dress 
but she cry while she was saying this 

Chorus: Boy I've missed your kisses all the time but this is 
twenty-five minutes too late 
Though you traveled so far boy I'm sorry your are 
twenty-five minutes too late 

Out in the streets 
places where hungry hearts have nothing to eat 
inside my head 
still I can hear the words she said 

Chorus: 
Boy I've missed your kisses all the time but this is 
twenty-five minutes too late 
Though you traveled so far boy I'm sorry your are 
twenty-five minutes too late 

(repeat chorus)

I can still hear her say.......
                        
                    |
