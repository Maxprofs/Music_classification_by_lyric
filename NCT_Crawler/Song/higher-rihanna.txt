                        Song: Higher - Rihanna

[Rihanna]
This whiskey got me feelin' pretty
So pardon if I'm impolite
I just really need your ass with me

Higher, higher than I’ve ever been, babe
Just come over, let’s pour a drink, babe
I hope I ain’t calling you too late
                        
                    |
