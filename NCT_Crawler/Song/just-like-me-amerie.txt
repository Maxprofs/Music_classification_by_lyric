                        Bài hát: Just Like Me - Amerie

I've given up on love
But I gave up on the chance
That I'd ever fall
Head over heels
And all the stars
I wished upon
I never thought
That one would fall
Down on me
Ooh, it's good to know

There's somebody
Somebody who feels like me
(Ooh, tt's good to know)
There's Somebody
Somebody who loves like me
(Yeah, I waited all my life)
For somebody
For somebody who can do
It like me
(And ooh, tt's good to know)
Found somebody
Found somebody
Who's just like me
(Somebody who's just like me)

Now here we are
And I wanna
Make the most of tt
Wanna hold you
And get close to it
Baby, let me love you
Don't let go
And promise that you won't forget

I want you for myself
Better know I'm not gonna share
I wanna feel you
Deep inside of me
I'm so happy
That you came to me
And ooh, I can't believe

There's somebody
Somebody who feels like me
(Whoa, that there's somebody who can do
It like me)
There's somebody
Somebody who loves like me
(I've been waiting all my life)
For somebody
For somebody who can do
It like me
(Who can do it like me)
Found somebody
Found somebody
Who's just like me
(Somebody who's just like me)

Everytime I look
Into your eyes
(When I look in your eyes I)
I just think of
How you changed my life
Every kiss
(Kiss)
Every touch
(Touch)
Even scent of you
All over me
When you leave
(When you leave, I can't sleep)
Til your back in my arms
(And I need you)
Can't you see
Before you babe
I wasn't living
But now

There's Somebody
Somebody who feels like Me
(There's Somebody Like Me)
There's somebody
Somebody who loves like me
(Said you know, didn't know somebody)
For somebody
For somebody who can do
It like me
(Waited all my Life)
Found somebody
Found somebody
Who's just like me
(Somebody who's just like me)

There's somebody
Somebody who feels like me
There's somebody
Somebody who loves like me
For somebody
For somebody who can do it like me
Found somebody
Found somebody
Who's just like me
