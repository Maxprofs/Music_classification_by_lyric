My oh my do you wanna say goodbye ?
To have the kingdom , baby , tell me why
My oh my do you wanna say goodbye ?
To rule the country , baby , you and i
If you were my king
My oh my do you wanna say goodbye ?
To have the kingdom , baby , tell me why
My oh my do you wanna say goodbye ?
To rule the country , baby , you and i

Little princess in a terrible mess ,
A kingdom alone, with no love to confess
Dreams of a prince on a tall white hourse
Run like a spirit by castle walls .
Gotta steal from rich, when they don't know i'm coming
Gotta give to the poor 
No time for loving

My oh my don't you cry ,
Cause there is no way, i'm staying
I will leave say ? Bye bye ? I'm going my way 


My oh my do you wanna say goodbye ?
To have the kingdom , baby , tell me why
My oh my do you wanna say goodbye ?
To rule the country , baby , you and i
If you were my king
My oh my do you wanna say goodbye ?
To have the kingdom , baby , tell me why
My oh my do you wanna say goodbye ?
To rule the country , baby , you and i
.... If you were my king.. 
I would be your queen..
 if you were my king..
I would be your queen..

Mystery deep in the royal heart
Crying at night , i wanna be a part
Prince , oh , prince are you really sincere
That you one day are gonna disappear

Gotta steal from rich, 
When they don't know i'm coming
Gotta give to the poor 
No time for loving

My oh my don't you cry ,
Cause there is no way, i'm staying
I will leave say ? Bye bye ? I'm going my way 

My oh my 
My oh my 
My oh my
My oh my

My oh my do you wanna say goodbye ?
To have the kingdom , baby , tell me why
My oh my do you wanna say goodbye ?
To rule the country , baby , you and i ?

My oh my do you wanna say goodbye ?
To have the kingdom , baby , tell me why
My oh my do you wanna say goodbye ?
To rule the country , baby , you and i ?

.... If you were my king.. 
I would be your queen..
 if you were my king..
I would be your queen..
