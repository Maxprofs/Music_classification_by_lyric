                        Bài hát: Sexy Back - Justin Timberlake

I'm bringing sexy back
Them other boys don't know how to act
I think it's special, what's behind your back?
So turn around and I'll pick up the slack
(Take it to the bridge)

Dirty babe, you see these shackles
Baby I'm your slave
I'll let you whip me if I misbehave
It's just that no one makes me feel this way
(Take it to the chorus)

Come here girl, go ahead be gone with it
Come to the back, go ahead be gone with it
VIP, go ahead be gone with it
Drinks on me, go ahead be gone with it
Let me see what your twerkin' with, go ahead be gone with it
Look at those hips, go ahead be gone with it
You make me smile, go ahead be gone with it
Go 'head child, go ahead be gone with it
Get your sexy on, go ahead be gone with it (7x)
Get your sexy on.

I'm bringing sexy back
Them motherfuckers don't know how to act
Girl let me make up for all the things you lack
Cause you're burning up, I've got to get it fast
(Take it to the bridge)

Dirty babe, you see these shackles
Baby I'm your slave
I'll let you whip me if I misbehave
It's just that no one makes me feel this way
(Take it to the chorus)

Come here girl, go ahead be gone with it
Come to the back, go ahead be gone with it
VIP, go ahead be gone with it
Drinks on me, go ahead be gone with it
Let me see what your twerkin' with, go ahead be gone with it
Look at those hips, go ahead be gone with it
You make me smile, go ahead be gone with it
Go 'head child, go ahead be gone with it
Get your sexy on, go ahead be gone with it (7x)
Get your sexy on.

(You Ready?) (3x)

I'm bringing sexy back
Them motherfuckers watch how I attack
If that's your girl, better watch your back
Cause you're burning up for me, and that's a fact
(Take it to the chorus)

Come here girl, go ahead be gone with it
Come to the back, go ahead be gone with it
VIP, go ahead be gone with it
Drinks on me, go ahead be gone with it
Let me see what your twerkin' with, go ahead be gone with it
Look at those hips, go ahead be gone with it
You make me smile, go ahead be gone with it
Go 'head child, go ahead be gone with it
Get your sexy on, go ahead be gone with it (7x)
Get your sexy on.
