                        "Loved"

 Once again I bare myself before you
 Beggin' for a chance we never had
 You don’t want all I have to offer
 And its too late for me to take it back

 Look at where you always leave us standing
 Between all the way and not quite close enough
 There could be a place you dont believe in
 If you would only let yourself be loved

 Im the one who seems to keep you smiling
 And I'd be more if you'd take the dare
 The two of us, we're really children hiding
 Underneath the armor that we wear

 And these walls...aren't so tall
 That we're climbing

[chorus]

 So many hearts who'll never even
 Have the chance to hold
 What you seem to be so willing to let go
 What good is being strong and hiding in some harbor
 If you and I end up all alone

 Look at where you always leave us standing
 Between all the way and not quite close enough
 I could be what you just won’t believe in
 If you would only let yourself be loved
 Baby, wont you let yourself be loved...
