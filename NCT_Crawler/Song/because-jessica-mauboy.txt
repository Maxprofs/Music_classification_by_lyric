                        (verse 1)
It's all because,
I waited for so long, you showed me you were the one,
I gave you my heart, right from the very start so,
Every time you lied, i knew inside,
Get another chance, i was hurting, i was broken
I stayed to long and so that's why, you didn't think that i'd move on,

(chorus)
It's all because, i loved you, (because) i held you, (because) i believed you,
You're not what i needed, (because) i'm stronger,
(because) i'm better, (because) without you, you'd thought i'd be in pieces,
Because (you thought i'd be in pieces), because, i loved ya, (because) i loved ya, (because) i loved ya

(verse 2)
You gave me, just one thing, but taking from the beginning
You left me, a heart ache, how much more could i take,
With every alibi, that made me cry, i'd still gave you more,
I should've given up, when i had had enough,
But i stayed too long, that's why, you didn't think that i'd move on,

(chorus)

(verse 3)
I made a mistake of giving me to you,
I made a mistake of loving you x4

(chorus)
