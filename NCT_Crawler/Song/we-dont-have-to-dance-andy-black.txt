                        Song: We Don'T Have To Dance - Andy Black

Record scratched; Steve Miller Band
Tattooed necks and tattooed hands
Oh, how don't you drown in a rain storm?

Fresh regrets, vodka sweats
The sun is down and we're bound to get
Exhausted and so far from the shore

You're never gonna get it
I'm a hazard to myself
I'll break it to you easy
This is hell, this is hell
You're looking and a' whispering
You think I'm someone else
This is hell, yes.
Literal hell.

We don't have to talk
We don't have to dance
We don't have to smile
We don't have to make friends
It's so nice to meet you,
Let's never meet again
We don't have to talk
We don't have to dance
We don't have to dance

Bottles smash, I raise my hand
How can you all even stand
And why is there joy in this poison, oh

Faking smiles and confidence
Driving miles to capture this excitement
I can't take anymore, oh

You're never gonna get it
I'm a hazard to myself
I'll break it to you easy
This is hell, this is hell
You're looking and a' whispering
You think I'm someone else
This is hell, yes.
I am in hell

We don't have to talk
We don't have to dance
We don't have to smile
We don't have to make friends
It's so nice to meet you,
Let's never meet again

We don't have to talk
We don't have to dance
We don't have to dance
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah

You're never gonna get it
I'm a hazard to myself
I'll break it to you easy

This is hell, this is hell
You're looking and a' whispering
You think I'm someone else
This is hell, yes.
Literal hell.

We don't have to talk
We don't have to dance
We don't have to smile
We don't have to make friends
It's so nice to meet you,
Let's never meet again

We don't have to talk
We don't have to dance
We don't have to dance
We don't have to talk
We don't have to talk
We don't have to dance
We don't have to talk
Talk talk
We don't have to dance
We don't have to talk
Talk talk talk talk
Talk talk talk
