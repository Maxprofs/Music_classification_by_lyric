                        Bài hát: Take The Box (Live At Concorde) - Amy Winehouse

Your neighbours were screaming 
I don't have a key for downstairs, so I punched all the buzzers hoping you wouldn't be there 
So now my head's hurting 
You say I always get my own way 
But you were in the shower when I got there, I'd have wanted to stay, but I got nothing to say 

Cos you were so beautiful before today 
But then I heard what you got to say...man that was ugly 

The Moschino bra you bought me last Christmas 
Put it in the box, put it in the box 
Frank's in there and I don't care 
Put it in the box, put it in the box 
Just take it 
Take the box 

Take the box 

I came home this evening and nothing felt like how it should be 
I feel like writing you a letter but that is not me...you know me 
Feel so f*cking angry; don't wanna be reminded of you 
But when I left my sh*t in your kitchen, I said goodbye to your bedroom it smelled of you 

Mr False Pretence, you don't make sense 
I just don't know you 
But you make me cry, where's my kiss goodbye? 
I think I love you 

The Moschino bra you bought me last Christmas 
Put it in the box, put it in the box 
Frank's in there and I don't care 
Put it in the box, put it in the box 
Now take it 
Take the box 
Just take it, take it 
Take the box 
And now just take the box 
Take the box 

Take the box
