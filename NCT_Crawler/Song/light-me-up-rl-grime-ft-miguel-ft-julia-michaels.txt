                        Bài hát: Light Me Up - RL Grime, Miguel, Julia Michaels

[Verse 1: Miguel]
You can dry your tears, every tide must change
Calm your fears, you can climb again
We forget that it's so easy to love when everything is good
Don't compare, 'cause every seasons reign
While you're here, just know I'll hold your hand, hand, hand, hand

[Pre-Chorus: Miguel]
And I will guide you
Let me remind you
Heights I would fly to
Depths I would dive to
Yeah I'll always find you

[Chorus: Miguel]
Yeah baby light me up
You can breathe me in
I'mma hold you up
Until the quiet comes, woah
Yeah baby light me up
You can breathe me in
I'mma hold you up
Until the quiet comes

[Verse 2: Julia Michaels]
Sure we have our fights
Sure we have our doubts
Sure, we lie
We're not lying now, we know why
'Cause it's so easy to love when everything is good
Hold my skin, hold me in your hands
Let's begin, to give you all I am
Mmmm, to give you all I am

[Pre-Chorus: Julia Michaels]
And I will guide you
Let me remind you
Heights I would fly to
Depths I would dive to
Yeah I'll always find you

[Chorus: Miguel & Julia Michaels]
So baby light me up
You can breathe me in
I'mma hold you up
Until the quiet comes, woah
Baby light me up
You can breathe me in
I'mma hold you up
Until the quiet comes, yeah
Until the quiet comes

[Bridge: Miguel & Julia Michaels]
La, da, de, da, da, da
You and I should tag our names across the sky, yeah
You and I, across the sky, across the sky babe
La, da, de, da, da, da
Babe, babe
So what, if we don't even have to try?
Babe, babe
Babe, babe
No, no, no, no, no

[Chorus: Miguel]
So baby light me up
You can breathe me in
I'mma hold you up
Until the quiet comes, woah
Baby light me up
You can breathe me in
I'mma hold you up
Until the quiet comes, yeah
Until the quiet comes
                        
                    |
