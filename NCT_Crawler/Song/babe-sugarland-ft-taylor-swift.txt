                        Bài hát: Babe - Sugarland, Taylor Swift

[Verse 1: Sugarland]
What a shame
Didn't wanna be the one that got away, yeah
Big mistake, broke the sweetest promise that you never should have made
I'm here on the kitchen floor
You call, but I won't hear it
You said no one else, how could you do this, babe?

[Chorus: Sugarland & Taylor Swift]
You really blew this, babe
We ain't getting through this one, babe
This is the last time I'll ever call you, babe
This is the last time, this is the last time, this is the last time, I'll ever call you babe

[Verse 2: Sugarland]
What a waste
Taking down the pictures and the plans we made, yeah
And it's strange how your face doesn't look so innocent
Your secret has it's consequence and that's on you, babe
I break down every time you call
We're a wreck, you're the wrecking ball
We said no one else, how could you do this, babe?

[Chorus: Sugarland & Taylor Swift]
You really blew this, babe
We ain't getting through this one, babe
This is the last time I'll ever call you, babe
This is the last time, this is the last time, this is the last time

[Bridge: Sugarland]
Since you admitted it, I keep picturing
Her lips on your lips, I can't unsee it
I hate that because of you, I can't love you
Babe
What a shame, didn't want to be the one that got away
How could you do this, babe?

[Chorus: Sugarland & Taylor Swift]
You really blew this, babe
We ain't getting through this one, babe
How could you do this, babe
This is the last time, this is the last time, this is the last time, I'll ever call you babe

[Outro: Sugarland & Taylor Swift]
How could you do this, babe?
I'm here on the kitchen floor, you call but I won't hear it
You said I'm no one else, we ain't getting through this one, babe
I break down every time you call, this is the last time
We're a wreck, you're the wrecking ball
This is the last time, this is the last time
You said I'm no one else, this is the last time
I'll never call you babe
