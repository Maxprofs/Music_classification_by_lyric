                        Bài hát: Problem (Glee Cast Version) - Glee Cast

Ha ha
Uh, huh
It's Iggy Iggs
I got one more problem with you girl, ey
One less, one less problem
Hey baby even though I hate ya
I wanna love ya
(I want you)
And even though I can't forgive ya
I really wanna
(I want you)
Tell me, tell me baby
Why can't you leave me?
Cause even though I shouldn't want it
I gotta have it
(I want you)
Head in the clouds, got no weight on my shoulders
I should be wiser and realize that I've got
One less problem without you
I got one less problem without you
I got one less problem without you
(I got one less, one less problem)
One less problem without you
I got one less problem without you
I got one less problem without you
(I got one less, one less problem)
I know you're never gonna wake up
I gotta give up
(But it's you)
I know I shouldn't ever call back
Or let you come back
(But I do)
Every time you touch me
And say you love me
I get a little bit breathless
I shouldn't want it
(But I do)
Head in the clouds, got no weight on my shoulders
I should be wiser and realize that I've got
One less problem without you
I got one less problem without you
I got one less problem without you
(I got one less, one less problem)
One less problem without you
I got one less problem without you
I got one less problem without you (Oh babe)
(I got one less, one less problem) (Ooh babe)
It's Iggy Iggs
Uh, what you got
Smart money bettin' I'll be better off without you
In no time I'll be forgettin' all about you
You saying that you know but I really, really doubt you
Understand my life is easy when I ain't around you
Iggy, Iggy to biggie to be here stressin'
I'm thinkin' I love the thought of you more than I love your presence
And the best thing now is probably for you to exit
I let you go, let you back, I finally learned my lesson
No half-stepping, either you want it or you just playin'
I'm listening to you knowin' I can't believe what you're sayin'
There's a million you's, baby boo, so don't be dumb
I got 99 problems but you won't be one
Like what
Ooh
One less, one less problem
Oooh oh
One less, one less problem
Head in the clouds, got no weight on my shoulders
I should be wiser and realize that I've got
One less problem without you (Hey)
I got one less problem without you (Oh, babe)
I got one less problem without you (Woo)
I got one less, one less problem (Ooh, baby)
One less problem without you (Yeah, yeah)
I got one less problem without you (Oo, hey)
I got one less problem without you
I got one less, one less problem (Ooh)
One less problem without you (Hey)
I got one less problem (without you)
(I got one less, one less, yeah)
I got one less problem without you
I got one less, one less (Problem, yeah)
