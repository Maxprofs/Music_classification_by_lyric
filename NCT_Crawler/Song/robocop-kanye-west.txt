Kanye West - Robocop
808's & Heartbreak

'Bout the baddest girl I ever seen
Straight up outta movie scene
Who knew she was a drama queen
That'll turn my life to Stephen King's
Checking everything like I'm on parole
Up late night, like she on patrol
I told her it's some things she don't need to know
She never let it go, oh

Okay, okay, okay okay, you will never stop it now
You never stop it now
Okay, okay, okay, you will never stop it now
We need to drop it now, DROP IT DROP IT

Cause I don't want no ROBOCOP
You movin' like a ROBOCOP
When did you become a ROBOCOP
No, I don't need a ROBOCOP

Just looking at your history
You're like the girl in misery
She said she ain't take it to this degree
Well let's agree to disagree
I know she kinda crazy but it turns me on
Keep it up enough to keep it going on
I told her it's some things she don't need to know
She never let it go, oh oh

Okay, okay, okay, okay
You will never stop it now
You never stop it now
Okay, okay, okay, you will never stop it now
We need to drop it now, DROP IT DROP IT

Cause I don't want no ROBOCOP
You movin' like a ROBOCOP
When you become a ROBOCOP
I swear you gotta make it stop

Stop, Drop, Roll, Pop
Bitch, I'm cold,
I, take that go, ahh
Throw that bow
Oh, that was slow, that can go
That you know, took em to the back, you know
Back in the flo' and went back in the door
{Mumbles}
Okay
Okay
Okay (hey hey)

It really ain't okay, okay, okay-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay-ay
