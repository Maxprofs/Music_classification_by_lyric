                        Verse 1:
 Some days I just wanna up and call it quits,
 I feel like I'm surrounded by wall o' bricks,
 Every time I go to get up I just fall in pits,
 My life's like one great big ball of ***,
 If I could just put it all in to all I spit,
 'Stead of always try'na swallow it,
 Instead of staring at this wall and ***,
 While I sit writers block sick of all this ***,
 Can't call it ***, all I know is I'm about to hit the wall,
 If I have to see another one of mom's alcoholic fits,
 This is it, last straw, that's all, that's it,
 I ain't dealing with another *** politic,
 I'm like a skillet bubbling, untill it filters up,
 I'm about to kill it, I can feel it building up,
 Blow this building up, I've concealed enough,
 My cup run'ith over I done filled it up,
 The pen explodes and busts, ink spills my guts,
 You think all I do is stand here and feel my nuts,
 Well I'm a show you what, you gonna feel my rush,
 You don't feel it then it must be to real to touch,
 Peel the dutch, I'm about to tear *** up,
 Goosebumps, yeah I'ma make your hair sit up,
 Yeah sit up, I'ma tell you who I be,
 I'ma make you hate me cause you ain't me,
 You wait, it ain't to late to finally see,
 What you close minded ***s were to blind to see,
 Whoever finds me, is gonna get a finders fee,
 Out this world ain't no one out their mind as me,
 You need peace of mind, here's a piece of mine,
 All I need's a line but sometimes,
 I don't always find the words to rhyme,
 To express how I'm really feeling at that time,
 Yeah sometimes, sometimes, sometimes, it's just sometimes,
 It's always me, how dark can these hallways be,
 The clock strikes midnight, 1, 2, then half past 3,
 This half ass rhyme with this half ass piece of paper,
 I'm desperate at my desk if I could just get the rest,
 Of this *** off my chest, again, stuck in this slump,
 Can't think of nothing, *** I'm stumped,
 Look wait here comes something,
 Nope, it's not good enough, scribble it out, new pad,
 Crinkle it up and throw this *** out,
 I'm fizzling now thought I figured it out,
 Ball's in my court but I'm scared to dribble it out,
 I'm afraid, but why am I afraid, why am I a slave to this trade,
 Cyanide I'll spit to the grave, real enough to rile you up,
 Want me to flip it I can rip it any style you want,
 I'm a switch hitter bitch, Jimmy Smith ain't a quitter,
 I'm a sit here till I get enough,
 For me to finally hit a *** boiling point,
 Put some oil in your joints,
 Flip the coin bitch come get destroyed,
 An mc's worst dream I make 'em tense they hate me,
 See me and shake like a chain-link fence,
 By the looks of them you would swear that Jaws was coming,
 By the screams of 'em you would swear I'm sawing someone,
 By the way they running you would swear the law was coming,
 It's now or never and tonight It's all or nothing,
 Momma, Jimmy keeps leaving on us, he said he'd be back,
 He pinky promised, I don't think he's honest,
 I'll be back baby I just got to beat this clock,
 *** this clock, I'ma make 'em eat this watch,
 Don't believe me watch, I'ma win this race,
 And I'ma come back and rub my *** in your face,
 Bitch, I found my niche, you gon hear my voice,
 Till you sick of it you ain't gonna have a choice,
 If I gotta scream till I have half a lung,
 If I have half a chance I'll grab it, rabbit run.
