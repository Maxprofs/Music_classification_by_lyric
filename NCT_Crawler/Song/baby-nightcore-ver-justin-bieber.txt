                        Bài hát: Baby (Nightcore Ver) - Justin Bieber

Ohh wooaah Ohh wooaah Ohh wooaah 
You know you love me, I know you care 
Just shout whenever, And I'll be there 
You are my love, You are my heart 
And we will never ever ever be apart 

Are we an item? Girl quit playing 
We're just friends, What are you sayin' 
So there's another and look right in my eyes 
My first love broke my heart for the first time, 

And I was like 
Baby, baby, baby oohh 
Like baby, baby, baby noo 
Like baby, baby, baby ooh 
I thought you'd always be mine mine 

Baby, baby, baby oohh 
Like baby, baby, baby noo 
Like baby, baby, baby ohh 
I thought you'd always be mine,mine 

oh oh 
For you, I would have done whatever 
And I just cant believe we ain't together 
And I wanna play it cool, But I'm loosin' you 
I'll buy you anything, I'll buy you any ring 
And I'm in pieces, Baby fix me 
And you shake me til' you wakeï»¿ me from this bad dream 

I'm going down, down, down, down~ 
And I just can't believe , my first love won't be around 

And I'm like.. 
Baby, baby, baby oohh 
Like baby, baby, baby noo 
Like baby, baby, baby ohh 
I thought you'd always be mine, mine 

Baby, baby, baby ohh 
Like baby, baby, baby noo 
Like baby, baby, baby ohh 
I thought you'd always be mine, mine 

Luda, When I was thirteen , I had my first love 
There was nobody that compare to my baby 
And nobody can't be between us 
Or can ever come above 
She had me going crazy 
Oh, I was starstruck 
She woke me yyee-up daily 
Don't need no starbucks 
She make my heart pound 
Lets give her beat when I see her in the street 
and, At school, on the playground 
But I really wanna see her on a weekend 
She knows she got me dazing 
Coz she was so amazing 
And now, my heart is breakin' 
But I just keep on sayin'.. 

Baby, baby, baby ohh 
Like baby, baby, baby noo 
Like baby, baby, baby oooh 
I thought you'd always be mine,mine 

Baby, baby, baby ohh 
Like baby, baby, baby noo 
Like baby, baby, baby oooh 
I thought you'd always be mine,mine
