                        Here, here in this world
 Where do we go
 Where can we turn
 When we need some love
 It seems that love
 Just can't be found
 Where, where do we stand
 When love's supply
 Don't meet love's demand

 We got enough stars
 To light the sky at night
 Enough sun to make
 The whole world bright
 We got more than enough
 But there's one thing
 There's just not enough of...

 Chorus:
 Not enough love and understanding
 We could use some love
 To ease these troubled times
 Not enough love and understanding
 Why, oh why

 Spend all of our time
 Building buildings up to the sky
 Reaching everywhere but where
 We need to reach the most
 Hearts never can win
 Oh, in this race
 This race that we're in

 We've got enough cars
 To drive around the world
 Enough planes to take us anywhere
 We got more than enough
 But there's one thing
 There's just not enough of...

 Chorus x 2

 We need some understandin'
 We need a little more love
 Some love and understandin'
 Enough stars to light the sky at night
 Enough sun to make the whole world bright
 Enough hearts to find some love inside
 We got more than enough
 But there's one thing
 There's just not enough of...

 Chorus
                        
                    |
