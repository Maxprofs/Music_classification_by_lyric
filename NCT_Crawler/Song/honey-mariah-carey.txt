Honey you can have me
When you want me
If you simply ask me to be there
And your the only one who
Makes me come running
Cause what you got is far
Beyond compare
And it's just like honey
When your love comes over me
Oh baby i've got a dependency
Always strung out for another
Taste of your honey
It's like honey when it washes over me
You know sugar never ever was so sweet
And i'm dying for you cryin' for you i adore you
One hit of your love addicted me
Now i'm strung out on you darlin'
Don't you see every night and day
I can hardly wait for another taste of honey
Honey i can't describe
How good it feels inside
I can't be elusive
With you honey
Because it's blatant
That i'm feeling you
And it's too hard for me
To leave abruptly
Cause your the only thing
I wanna do
Always strung out for another taste of honey
