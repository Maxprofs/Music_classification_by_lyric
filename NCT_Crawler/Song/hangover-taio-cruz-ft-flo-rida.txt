                        Bài hát : Hangover - Taio Cruz, Flo Rida

I got a hangover, wo-oh!
I've been drinking too much for sure
I got a hangover, wo-oh!
I got an empty cup
Pour me some more

So I can go until I blow up, eh
And I can drink until I throw up, eh
And I don't never ever want to grow up, eh
I wanna keep it going, keep keep it going,
going, going, going...

I got a little bit trashed last night, night
I got a little bit wasted, yeah yeah
I got a little bit mashed last night, night
I got a little shhh faced it, yeah yeah

Oh oh oh oh oh
I'm on the roof
Oh oh oh oh oh
If you don't know
Oh oh oh oh oh
Well now you know
Oh oh oh oh oh

I got a hangover, wo-oh!
I've been drinking too much for sure
I got a hangover, wo-oh!
I got an empty cup
Pour me some more

So I can go until I blow up, eh
And I can drink until I throw up, eh
And I don't never ever want to grow up, eh
I wanna keep it going, keep keep it going,
Come on!

[Flo Rida - Rap]
Drink up, cause a party ain't a party,
Till you ride all through it
End up on the floor can't remember you clueless
Officer like: What the hell is you doing?
Stumbling, fumbling you wonder what come again
Give me henn, give me gin, give me liquor,
Give me champagne
Bubbles till the end
What happens after that, 
If you inspired it 'till I'm ten?
I call my homie Taio, we can all sip again
Get it in and again and again
Wasted so what, irrelevant
We're kicked to the head, who's selling it
Now I got a hangover, that's my medicine
Don't mean like I said, I'm too intelligent
A little jack can't hurt this veteran
I show up but I never throw up, 
So let the drinks go up, go up

[Taio Cruz]
I got a hangover, wo-oh!
I've been drinking too much for sure
I got a hangover, wo-oh!
I got an empty cup
Pour me some more

So I can go until I blow up, eh
And I can drink until I throw up, eh
And I don't never ever want to grow up, eh
I wanna keep it going, keep keep it going,
Come on!
Going, going, going, going...

I got a hangover, wo-oh!
I've been drinking too much for sure
I got a hangover, wo-oh!
I got an empty cup
Pour me some more

So I can go until I blow up, eh
And I can drink until I throw up, eh
And I don't never ever want to grow up, eh
I wanna keep it going, keep keep it going,
Come on!
