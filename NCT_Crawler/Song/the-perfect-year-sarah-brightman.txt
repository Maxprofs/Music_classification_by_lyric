                        Bring out the old, bring in the new
 A midnight wish to share with you
 Your lips are warm, my head is light
 Were we alive before tonight? I don't need a crowded ballroom
 Everything I want is here
 If you're with me, next year will be
 The perfect year No need to hear the music play
 Our eyes say all there is to say
 The clock has struck
 The die is cast, let's take a chance
 Forget the past I don't need a crowded ballroom
 Everything I want is here
 If you're with me, next year will be
 The perfect year I don't need a crowded ballroom
 Everything I want is here
 If you're with me, next year will be
 The perfect year It's New Year's Eve, and hopes are high
 Dance one year in, kiss one goodbye
 Another chance, another start
 So many dreams to tease the heart We don't need a crowded ballroom
 Everything we want is here
 And face to face, we will embrace
 The perfect year We don't need a crowded ballroom
 Everything we want is here
 And face to face, we will embrace
 The perfect year
                        
                    |
