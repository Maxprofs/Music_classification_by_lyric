[Intro:]
We alive right now
Let's get high right now!

[Verse 1:]
We don't give a damn about money
We alive right now
All we do is party and get high right now
Shot, shot! I'm a take another shot
Get a check when I party, so the money don't stop
If you on me, just watch, you don't love me, I'll tap
Tap tap! Man I do homie, pow!
I'm a need y'all to turn the *** up, now!
I'm a need y'all to roll a blunt up, now!
I'm a need y'all to fill yo cups up!
Now I'm a need y'all to while out
Ga ga, do it again
Lost my mind, gonna loose it again
You're so fine, you need a friend
I gotta carry that light until we begin, like action

[Chorus x2:]
Rage, rage the night away
Forget about the money I'll spend today
Rage, rage the night away
Forget about the money I'll spend today
Rage, rage the night away
Forget about the money I'll spend today
You could save everything till you in the grave
I'll ball to you fall, throw it all away

[Verse 2:]
Hangin' like apostrophes you can quote me
Then throw the cake in yo face like Steve Aoki
She go hard in the paint and she need to know me
Her body insane, man, she provoke me
Like pow!
I'm a need y'all to turn the *** up, now!
I'm a need y'all to roll a blunt up, now!
I'm a need y'all to fill yo cups up, now!
Now I'm a need y'all to while out
Get down, keep it on the low
You a jump down girl, no geronimo
In the condo you know I would go
On the bed, on the couch and on the floor
On the floor [x3] get on the floor
Don't step, nigga, back, that's all I know
Don't step nigga back, throwin' all my dough
Squad!

[Chorus x2:]
Rage, rage the night away
Forget about the money I'll spend today
Rage, rage the night away
Forget about the money I'll spend today
Rage, rage the night away
Forget about the money I'll spend today
You could save everything till you in the grave
I'll ball to you fall, throw it all away
                        
                    |
