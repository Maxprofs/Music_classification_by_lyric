                        I'm better
So much better now
I see the light, touch the light,
We're together now

I'm better
So much better now
Look to the skies, gives me life
We're together now

We've only just begun
Hypnotised by drums
Until forever comes
You'll find us chasing the sun
They said this day wouldn't come
We refused to run
We've only just begun
You'll find us chasing the sun

Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
You'll find us chasing the sun
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
You'll find us chasing the sun

When Daylight's fading
We're gonna play in the dark
Till it's golden again
And now it feels so amazing
Can see you coming
And We'll never grow old again
You'll find us chasing the sun

I'm never
I'm never down
Lying here, staring up
And you're looking down

I'm never
I'm never down
Live forever, forever
With you around

We've only just begun
Hypnotised by drums
Until forever comes
You'll find us chasing the sun
They said this day wouldn't come
We refused to run
We've only just begun
You'll find us chasing the sun
The sun, the sun, the sun
You'll find us chasing the sun

Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
You'll find us chasing the sun
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
You'll find us chasing the sun

When the Daylight's fading
We're gonna play in the dark
Till it's golden again

And now it feels so amazing
Can see you coming
And We'll never grow old again
You'll find us chasing the sun

You'll find us chasing the sun

When the Daylight's fading
We're gonna play in the dark
Till it's golden again

And now it feels so amazing
Can see you coming
And We'll never grow old again
You'll find us chasing the sun

Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
You'll find us chasing the sun
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
You'll find us chasing the sun
