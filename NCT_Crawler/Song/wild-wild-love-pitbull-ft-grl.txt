                        Bài hát: Wild Wild Love - Pitbull, G.R.L.

All this wild wild love of us
It can't be tamed, no
All this wild wild love of us
It can't be tamed, no
For better or worse
A blessing or a curse
Long live this wild wild love of us

Long live this wild wild love

[Pitbull]
Ladies and gentleman
You're looking at the next play boy
Who you?
That's right, Armando Christian Perez
And when it comes to that pretty little beauty cutie
Don't stop get it get it baby let me pay it
I got that wild love
Love to get wild dirty freaky nasty, yeah I said it
I'll make you lose your heart and your mind at the same tiime
Don't believe, bet it
I'm obsessed with that wild love for sure
Even though it's a kiss one to two
It's a gift and curse for sure
But baby you know that you love it too, that's why

You need it, you want it
All over your body
This loving I'm giving
It's worth more money
You need it, you want it
All over your body

I know that you want this
Wild, wild, love

All this wild wild love of us
It can't be tamed, no
All this wild wild love of us
It can't be tamed, no
For better or worse
A blessing or a curse
Long live this wild wild love of us

For better or worse
A blessing or a curse
Long live this wild wild love of us

Not only my crown in the player president
The globe is my backyard, baby seven day
When it comes to Miami, I always represent
Read all about, ladies and gents
I'm the chico for the game
I like my women yang
I like my women yang
I like my women fan
I like them off the chain
Take 'em all the world cup, Brazil for the bang
You know I'll meet 'em, greet 'em, read 'em
Treat 'em, always keep them feeling right
I don't know if I can handle all if fab
But baby we can try tonight, dale

You need it, you want it
All over your body
This loving I'm giving
It's worth more money
You need it, you want it
All over your body

I know that you want this
Wild, wild, love

All this wild wild love of us
It can't be tamed, no
All this wild wild love of us
It can't be tamed, no
For better or worse
A blessing or a curse
Long live this wild wild love of us

All this wild wild love of us
It can't be tamed, no
All this wild wild love of us
It can't be tamed, no
For better or worse
A blessing or a curse
Long live this wild wild love of us
