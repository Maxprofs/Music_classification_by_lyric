                        Bài hát: Doin' Time - Sublime

Summertime and the living's easy
And Bradley's on the microphone with ras m.g.
All the people in the dance will agree
That we're well qualified to represent the LBC
Me, me and Louie run to the party
Dance to the rhythm it gets harder

Me and my girl we got this relationship
I love her so bad but she treats me like...
On lock down like a penitentiary
She spreads her lovin' all over
And when she gets home there’s none left for me

[Chorus]

Oh take this veil from off my eyes
My burning sun will someday rise
So what am I gonna be doin' for a while
Said I'm gonna play with myself
Show them how we come off the shelf
So what?

[Chorus]

Evil
I've come to tell you that she's evil most definitely
Evil
Ornery scandalous and evil most definitely
The tension is getting hotter
I'd like to hold her head underwater

Me and my girl we got this relationship
Me and my girl we got this relationship
My girl we got this relationship
And my girl we got this relationship

Take a tip, take a tip, take a tip from me
Bradley's on the microphone with ras m.g.
All the people in the dance will agree
That we're well qualified to represent the LBC
Me, la la Louie well everybody run to the rhythm it gets harder

Summertime, the living's easy...
