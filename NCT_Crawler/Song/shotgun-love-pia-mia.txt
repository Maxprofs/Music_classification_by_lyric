                        Bài hát : Shotgun Love - Pia Mia

Whoever said roses,
don't bloom in the winter time?
Whoever said rain drops,
don't turn into sunshine?

I'm runnin' away with my baby oh (x2)
I'm runnin' away ay ay ay ay ay (x2)
I'm runnin' away with my baby
Oh

Bang bang we're the talk of the town,
you already know what they're talkin' about
Hit the block with the top let down,
pull up at the scene and we shut it down

Fired up, blow me in the wind
Deuce in the air we ain't worried bout them
Do the time I'ma do the crime,
You can give me life,
I'ma ride or die for yah

All of the police,
Couldn't catch us together baby
We never go slowly,
If they take you they take me

I'm runnin' away with my baby oh (x2)
I'm runnin' away ay ay ay ay ay (x2)
I'm runnin' away with my baby
Oh

Bang bang it's a shotgun love
Peddle to the floor,
we can never get enough
Everytime they talkin', why they gotta bring us up?
Haters gonna hate but we keep doing us

Light me up,
take me higher baby
Pull the whip over let me drive you crazy,
Backseat with the system bangin' (x2)

All of the police,
Couldn't catch us together baby
We never go slowly,
If they take you they take me

I'm runnin' away with my baby oh (x2)
I'm runnin' away ay ay ay ay ay (x2)
I'm runnin' away with my baby
Oh

Yeah yeah yeah
