                        Bài hát: Buena Chillout - Blue Cafe

If I ever have to leave
Then it doesn't matter where I go now
I'll be your love.
Baby if you let me breath even when I'm far away
Then I have no doubt
I'll be your love.

No no nothing ever dies, I want to believe into love now
But I don't know how.
what what what I wanna try
Is to find a map to your soul now, your soul now.

Coro:
De Alto Cedro voy para Macané
Luego a Cueto voy para Mayarí
De Alto Cedro voy para Macané
Luego a Cueto voy para Mayarí

If you're gonna wait for me I can guarantee
That I'll be your love, I have no doubt (no doubt)
Baby I don't really know where the road is leading me
But I have no doubt, I'll be your love.

No no nothing ever dies, I want to believe into love now
But I don't know how.
what what what I wanna try
Is to find a map to your soul now, your soul now.

Coro:
De Alto Cedro voy para Macané,
Luego a Cueto voy para Mayarí.
De Alto Cedro voy para Macané,
Luego a Cueto voy para Mayarí.

I can only be what you ..nowhere
You ain't stopping me but I said I don't care
When is the time for us maybe not in this life
When I win this fight when the time is right
So I'm thinking my time, maybe does the best, maybe does the last
Once that .. 1 2 3 .. ?cause you know I can't breath
Ah ah yeah so, that's my .. the time
I think I'm .. ?cause I lose my mind
?cause we are .. apart and is the river who stop for us
So that ..reaching nowhere, not at east, south or west
I wanna eat some gum .. are we gonna survive?

I'm wanting somebody, I need that somebody
I wanna somebody to live on
I wanna somebody , I wanna,
I wanna need somebody to hold on.

I am still on the way, someday I'm gonna stay
And you hear the pain in my voice
I'm am breaking my chain, do you feel the same
Can you hear the pain in my soul

2 x Chorus:
De Alto Cedro voy para Macané,
Luego a Cueto voy para Mayarí.
De Alto Cedro voy para Macané,
Luego a Cueto voy para Mayarí.
