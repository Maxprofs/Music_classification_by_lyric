                        Bài hát: Sacrifice - Black Atlass, Jessie Reyez

[Verse 1: Black Atlass]
I will never sacrifice my love, not even for you
You know I don't play it safe
Sometimes you have to break the rules

[Pre-Chorus: Black Atlass]
Yeah, we could call it love, or we could call it nothing
But you got what I want, so baby, give me something
Yeah, we could call it love, or we could call it nothing
But you got what I want, you know I do, too

[Chorus: Black Atlass]
So let me, let me just lay you down
Turn me on, take it all tonight
Let me, let me just lay you down
Turn me on, take it all tonight

[Verse 2: Jessie Reyez]
Beautiful, mmm
How do you make dangerous look so beautiful?
And how come when you kiss, you turn me into this?
I fall in love, oozin' up the way you do that
Don't even got you yet, but I can't imagine losing you

[Pre-Chorus: Black Atlass & Jessie Reyez]
Yeah, we could call it love, or we could call it nothing
But you got what I want, so baby, give me something
We could call it love, or we could call it nothing
But you got what I want, you know I do, too

[Chorus: Black Atlass & Jessie Reyez]
So let me, let me just lay you down
Turn me on, take it all tonight
So let me, let me just lay you down
Turn me on, take it all tonight
Let me, let me just lay you down
Turn me on, take it all tonight
Let me, let me just lay you down
Turn me on, take it all tonight
