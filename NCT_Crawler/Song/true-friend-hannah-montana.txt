                        [VERSE 1] 
We sign our cards and letters BFF 
You've got a million ways to make me laugh 
You're lookin' out for me; you've got my back 
It's so good to have you around
 You know the secrets I could never tell
 And when I'm quiet you break through my shell 
Don't feel the need to do a rebel yell 
Cause you keep my feet on the ground 
[CHORUS 1] 
You're a true friend You're here till the end 
You pull me aside When something ain't right 
Talk with me now and into the night 
'Til it's alright again You're a true friend 
[VERSE 2] 
You don't get angry when I change the plans 
Somehow you're never out of second chances 
and Won't say "I told you" when I'm wrong again 
I'm so lucky that I found 
[CHORUS 2] 
A true friend You're here till the end 
You pull me aside When something ain't right 
Talk with me now and into the night 
'Til it's alright again 
[BRIDGE] 
True friends will go to the ends of the earth 
Till they find the things you need 
Friends hang on through the ups and the downs 
Cause they've got someone to believe in 
[CHORUS 3] 
A true friend You're here till the end 
You pull me aside When something ain't right 
Talk with me now and into the night 
Don't need to pretend
 ohh yeah 
A true friend 
You're here till the end(till the end) 
(Your here till the end) 
You pull me aside When something ain't right 
Talk with me now and into the night 
'Til it's alright again 
You're a true friend [3x]
