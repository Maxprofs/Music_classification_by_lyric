                        If you close your eyes your life, a naked truth revealed
Dreams you never lived, and scars never healed
In the darkness, light will take you to the other side
And find me waiting there you'll see, if you just close your eyes

Hearts uninspired, trapped inside somebody's dream
Too close to the fire, yet cold and numb with the pain
But the fever has broken, and the river has run to the sea
Washed to the ocean, and saved by a voice inside me.
Inside me a light was turned on Then I was alive

If you close your eyes your life, a naked truth revealed
Dreams you never lived, and scars never healed
In the darkness, light will take you to the other side
and find me waiting there you'll see, if you just close your eyes

Never thought I would be here, so high in the air
This is my unanswered prayer
Defined by another, so much wasted time
Out of the darkness, each breath that I take will be mine

If you close your eyes your life, a naked truth revealed
Dreams you never lived, and scars never healed
In the darkness, light will take you to the other side
and find me waiting there you'll see, if you just close your eyes
                        
                    |
