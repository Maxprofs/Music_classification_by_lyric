                        I bring myself down by making the things up
 I imagine you gone
 Russian roulette
 Like dancing with death
 I carry on

 I'll take the blame
 I know I've got it wrong
 But if you high tail
 I just can't carry on

 The blood in my veins
 Runs thin when I think
 Are you with somebody
 Opening doors
 Moonlight love
 And the promise you promise

 The fear inside
 Is stronger than the truth
 It grows day by day
 By night time I'm confused

 Oh help me
 You can go on you can go on
 Can't go on
 You can go on you can go on

 I'm a prisoner in chains
 Confound these thoughts
 I could kill somebody
 Like a lamb
 Like a dove
 You lay down while I shout
 Accepting your fate

 I'll take the blame
 I know I've got it wrong
 But if you high tail
 I just can't carry on

 Oh help me
 You can go on you can go on
 Can't go on
 You can go on you can go on

 Oh help me
 You can go on you can go on

 I bring myself down by making things up
 I imagine you gone
 Russian Roulette
 Like dancing with death
 I carry on

 Oh help me
 You can go on you can go on
 Can't go on
 You can go on you can go on
                        
                    |
