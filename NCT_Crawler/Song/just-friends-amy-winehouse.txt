                        When will we get the time to be
 Just friends? Its never safe for us not even in the evening
 Cos Ive been drinking
 Not in the morning
 Where your **** words Its always dangerous when everybodys sleeping
 And I've been thinking
 Can we be alone?
 Can we be alone? When will we get the time to be
 Just friends?
 When will we get the time to be
 Just friends? And no, I'm not a saint
 But the guilt will kill you
 If she dont first
 Ill never love you like her Though we need to find the time
 To just do this **** together 'fore it gets worse
 I wanna touch you
 But that just hurts When will we get the time to be
 Just, just friends?
 When will we get the time to be
 Just friends, just friends? When will we get the time to be
 Just friends, just friends?
 When will we get the time to be
 Just friends, just friends?
 Just friends
