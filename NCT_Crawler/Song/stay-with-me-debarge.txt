                        Baby you can't go on
 Wondering where you belong
 Let me help you find yourself
 'Cause you don't need nobody else You should be right here with me baby
 Instead of going around this frantic town and start messin' around
 With all the lonely, lonely people out there
 No one to care, won't you come stay with me because I love you so You tell me you love me so
 Why do you have to go?
 Everything you'll ever need
 You will find right here with me You should be right here with me babe
 Instead of going around this frantic town and start messin' around
 With all the lonely, lonely people out there
 No one to care, won't you come stay with me because I love you so Stay with me, stay with me, stay with me
 Stay with me, stay with me, stay with me
 Stay with me, stay with me, stay with me You should be with me babe
 You shouldn't go nowhere
 And all I'm trying to tell you babe
 Happiness is waiting for you So won't you stay with me?
 (Stay with me)
 So won't you stay with me?
 (Stay with me)
 I got what you need
 (Stay with me)
 So won't you stay with me?

 (Stay with me)
 Don't go, no no
 (Stay with me)
 Oh, I got what you need

 So won't you stay with me? Hey
