                        Bài hát: Get Together - Lenka

Left get together we can talk about the weather
Or most anything you like
Now we're all together and I hope it lost forever
Get my people here tonight

I love it when we hang around
And paint the town blue
And I can't think of anything else
I would like to do

Oh we are all connected and
we can make it better
To live this life
Oh we can get together and
we can talk it over
And make it right

Better together better together
Better together better together

Left get together I'll play you my favorite record
And we'll dance into the night
Now we're all together I'm so happy to have met yo
You are just the ones I like

Oh we are all connected and
we can make it better
To live this life
Oh we can get together and
we can talk it over
And make it right

Turn the lights down low
I wanna take it slow I wanna let go
Let the sun rise high
I wanna see how we can make our spirits fly

We are all connected and
we can make it better
To live this life
Oh we can get together and
we can talk it over
And make it right

Oh we are all connected and
we can make it better
To live this life
Oh we can get together and
we can talk it over
And make it right
Better together better together
Better together better together
