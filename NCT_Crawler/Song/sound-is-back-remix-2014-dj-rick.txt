                        Bài hát: Sound Is Back (Remix 2014) - DJ Rick

This is the sound 
Check this sound 
The right sound 
Back to destroy 
Don't destroy it 
Back to the rhythm 
Come on boy 

The sound is back inside my head 
It's been too long,the groove is strong 
This is the down town sound 
Detroit's amazing underground 
The house of techno, this home of trance 
The beat goes on, get a second change.. 
It's a new style from the past 
hard dance style is kicking back 

Wake up! 
Detroit is gonna make up 
It's back to make you better 
This melody's my fantasy,my life tonight 
Wake up! 
It's gonna give you pleasure 
It won't leave you ever 
The hard dance style will never die,it's here forever
