                        Bài hát: Cool - Alesso, Roy English

I saw stars on the pavement
California dreams
Looked up through the bright lights
No skies that I see

You said it’s all yours if you take it there
I said I can’t do it alone I swear
You said it’s all yours
It’s all yours when you smile

It’s only you
Loves me like you do
Trying to keep it cool
But I can’t keep cool about it
Acted like a fool
Ought to scream in front of you
I’m trying to keep it cool
But I can’t keep cool about it (about it)

Before you I was always lost
Drifting at sea
You were the beacon I’d followed home
You were the one that rescued me

You said it’s all yours if you take it there
I said I can’t do it alone I swear
You said it’s all yours
It’s all yours when you smile

It’s only you
Loves me like you do
Trying to keep it cool
But I can’t keep cool about it
Acted like a fool
Ought to scream in front of you
I’m trying to keep it cool
But I can’t keep cool about it (about it)

You said oh whoa
I won’t lose you no whoa

It’s only you
Loves me like you do
Trying to keep it cool
But I can’t keep cool about it
Acted like a fool
Ought to scream in front of you
I’m trying to keep it cool
But I can’t keep cool about it (about it)
