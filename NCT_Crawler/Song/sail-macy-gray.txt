                        This is how I show my love
 I made it in my mind because
 I blame it on my A.D.D. baby This is how an angel cries
 I blame it on my own sick pride
 Blame it on my A.D.D. baby Sail
 Sail
 Sail
 Sail Maybe I should cry for help
 Maybe I should kill myself
 Blame it on my A.D.D. baby Maybe I'm a different breed
 Maybe I'm not listening
 Blame it on my A.D.D. baby Sail
 Sail
 Sail
 Sail Would you mean it if I say it?
 I sail
 Sail
 Sail with me La la la la la la
 La la la la la la
 La la la la la la
 La la la la la la
 La la la la la la oh
 La la la la la la
 La la la la la la
 La la la la la la
 La la la la la la
 La la la la la la oh oh
 Would you cry for me baby? Sail
 Sail
 Sail with me baby
 This is how an angel cries With me into the dark, yea, into the dark
 Into the dark
 Into the dark
 Into the dark with me
 Sail with me baby
 Into the dark
 Into the dark with me
