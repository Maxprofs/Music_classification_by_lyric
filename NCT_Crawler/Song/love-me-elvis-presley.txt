                        Treat me like a fool
 Treat me mean and cruel
 But love me Wring my faithful heart
 Tear it all apart
 But love me (won't you love me) If you ever go
 Darling, I'll be oh-so lonely
 I'll be sad and blue
 Crying over you, dear only I would beg and steal (Beg and steal)
 Just to feel (Just to feel) your heart (I want your heart)
 Beatin' close to mine (So close to mine) Well, if you ever go
 Darling, I'll be oh-so lonely
 I'll be sad and blue
 Crying over you, dear only I would beg and steal (He would beg and steal)
 Just to feel(yes,just to feel) your heart (I want your heart)
 Beatin' close to mine (So close to mine) Well, if you ever go
 Darling, I'll be oh-so lonely
 Beggin' on knees
 All I ask is, please, please, love me
 Oh yeah
