                        While she lays sleeping
 I stay out late at night and play my songs
 And sometimes, all the nights can be so long
 And it's good when I finally make it home
 All alone While she lays dreaming
 I try to get undressed without the light
 And quietly she says, "How was your night?"
 And I come to her and say, "It was all right"
 And I hold her tight And she believes in me
 I'll never know just what she sees in me
 I told her someday, if she was my girl
 I could change the world with my little songs
 I was wrong But she has faith in me
 And so I go on trying faithfully
 And who knows maybe, on some special night
 If my song is right, I will find a way
 Find a way While she lays waiting
 I stumble to the kitchen for a bite
 Then I see my old guitar in the night
 Just waiting for me like a secret friend
 And there's no end While she lays crying
 I fumble with a melody or two
 And I'm torn between the things that I should do
 And she says to wake her up when I am through
 God, her love is true And she believes in me
 I'll never know just what she sees in me
 I told her someday, if she was my girl
 I could change the world with my little songs
 I was wrong But she has faith in me
 And so I go on trying faithfully
 And who knows maybe, on some special night
 If my song is right, I will find a way
 While she waits, while she waits for me
                        
                    |
