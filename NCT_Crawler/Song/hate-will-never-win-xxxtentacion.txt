                        Bài hát: Hate Will Never Win - Xxxtentacion

[Donald Trump:]
But a very important one, and it was scheduled to talk about the great things that we're doing with the secretary on the veterans administration
And we will talk about that very much so in a little while, but I thought I should put out a comment as to what's going on in Charlottesville
So, again, I want to thank everybody for being here, in particular I want to thank

[XXXTENTACION:]
Mind me while I sit and pretend to make amends
With all these false laws and menacing men
Will *** swallow you
I'll follow you down road
To this broken-hearted love for you
My heart is gone in series of corpse
Never mind me while I sit and pretend to make amends
With all these false laws and menacing men
Will *** swallow you
I'll follow you down road
To this broken-hearted love for you
My heart is gone in series of corpse

[XXXTENTACION (Donald Trump):]
Why the *** should I apologize?
Countries orderless, it's a lie
By these *** government scumbag dicksuckers with ties
(Great people, they're great people)
Wanna fight for my future
It's right in my hands
And the future of many youth if I play my cards can advance
And genuine dime, I opened my mind
Where can I find this future?
Sever your mind and you will be blind
And trapped in a mind, the flies within our walls
I'm feeling like my mind within a war between myself
Between this slavery of media, it's poor presentation
(Violence on many sides)
The youth within our nation
Such is a pity, depending on people resembling Bible Satan, uh
Set 'em up off and wet 'em up off like it’s PlayStation, uh
Open up your minds and come together as a nation, why?
Why?
Why?
Why?

[Donald Trump:]
This has been going on for a long, long time. It has no place in America
What is vital now is a swift restoration of law and order and the protection of innocent lives
No citizen should ever fear for their safety and security in our society
And no child should ever be afraid to go outside and play
                        
                    |
