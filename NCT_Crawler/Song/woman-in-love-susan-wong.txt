                        Bài hát: Woman In Love - Susan Wong

Life is a moment in space 
Where the dream has gone 
It's a lonelier place 
I kiss the morning goodbye 
But down inside you know 
we never know why 

The road is narrow and long 
Where eyes meet eyes 
And the feeling is strong 
I turn away from the wall 
I stumble and fall 
But I give you it all 

CHORUS 
I am a woman in love 
And I'd do anything 
To get you into my world 
And hold you within 
It's a right I defend 
Over and over again 
What do I do? 

With you eternally mine 
In love there is no measure of time 
We planned it all at the start 
That you and I live in each other's heart 

We may be oceans away 
But you feel my love and I hear what you say 
No truth is ever a lie 
I stumble and fall 
But I give you it all...................... 

CHORUS 

I am a woman in love 
And I'd do anything 
To get you into my world 
And hold you within 
It's a right I defend 
Over and over again 
What do I do? 

Ohhhhhh 

CHORUS


I am a woman in love 
And I'm talking to you 
I know how you feel 
What a woman can do


It's a right I defend 
Over and over again 


And I'd do anything 
To get you into my world 
And hold you within 
It's a right I defend 
Over and over again 
What do I do?
                        
                    |
