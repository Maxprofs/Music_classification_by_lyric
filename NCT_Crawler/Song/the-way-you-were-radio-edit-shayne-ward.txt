                        Bài hát: The Way You Were (Radio Edit) - Shayne Ward

I feel alone, surrounded by worn out faces in crowded places 
I'm on my own, just trying to get back
And I can't hide the guy that I used to be when it was you and me
I'm trying to find the girl that I knew

I gained so much, losing touch in the madness of it all
I was caught, I was trapped, gotta take me back to the

The way you were, the way you were
With your dreams and our simple plans
The way you were, the way you were
Nobody loved me the way you can
The way you were, the way you were
Take me back to the way you were
The way you were, the way you were
Take me back to the way you were

Time to move, I'm clearing a pathway through I can just see you and I
I won't be long, just want you to know
But I can't break through, there's too many people standing and being demanding
Reach out for me and don't you let go

Don't lose your way, I hope and pray that I reach you once again
Help me out and hold my hand, gotta take me back to the

The way you were, the way you were
With your dreams and our simple plans
The way you were, the way you were
Nobody loved me the way you can
The way you were, the way you were
Take me back to the way you were
The way you were, the way you were
Take me back to the way you were

The way you were, the way you were
With your dreams and our simple plans
The way you were, the way you were
Nobody loved me the way you can
The way you were, the way you were
Take me back to the way you were
The way you were, the way you were
Take me back to the way you were
