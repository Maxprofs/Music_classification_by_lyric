                        Now that you're out of my life 
I'm so much better 
You thought I'd be weak without you 
But I'm stronger 
You thought that I'd be broke without you 
But I'm richer 
You thought that I'd be sad without you 
I laugh harder 
You thought I wouldn't grow without you 
Now I'm wiser 
Thought that I'd be helpless without you 
But I'm smarter 
You thought that I'd be stressed without you 
But I'm chillin' 
You thought that I wouldn't sell without you 
Sold 9 million 

(Chorus): 
I'm a survivor( What?) 
I'm not gon give up (What?) 
I'm not gon stop( What?) 
I'm gon work harder ( What) 
I'm a survivor (What?) 
I'm gonna make it ( What?) 
I will survive (What?) 
Keep on surviving (What?) 
Thought I couldn't breathe without you 
I'm inhaling 
You thought I couldn't see without you 
Perfect vision 
You thought I couldn't last without you 
But I'm lasting 
You thought that I would die without you 
But I'm livin' 
Thought that I would fail without you 
But I'm on top 
Thought it would be over by now 
But it won't stop 
Thought that I would self-destruct 
But I'm still here 
Even in my years to come 
I'm still gonna be here 

(Chorus) 

I'm wishing you the best 
Pray that you are blessed 
Bring much success, no stress, and lots of happiness 
(I'm better than that) 
I'm not gon blast you on the radio 
(I'm better than that) 
I'm not gon hate on you in the magazines 
(I'm better than that) 
I'm not gonna compromise my Christianity 
(I'm better than that) 
You know I'm not gon *** you on the Internet
Cause my mama taught me "better than that"

(Chorus) 

After of all the darkness and sadness 
Soon comes happiness 
If I surround myself with positive things 
I'll gain prosperity.
                        
                    |
