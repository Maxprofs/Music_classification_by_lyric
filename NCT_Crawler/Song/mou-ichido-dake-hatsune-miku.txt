                        I'm gonna get so lonely...

I'm gonna get so lonely...

zure surechigai gokai o toku you ni ima nara ai no kotoba mo deru yo 
nani mo ka mo osoi deru kotoba wa kabosoi ano toki boku wa douka shite'ta yo 
kakkou no ii koto ja nai kedomo nani mo dekinai no sa 
tashika ni sono shunkan no shirase wa dairokkan 
muryoku o sugoku kamishimeru yoru orugooru mou sukoshi kanadesasete yo Baby

My words of love are finally coming out, as though to erase all our gaps and misunderstanding. 
It's too late for anything. My words are too feeble. Something was wrong with me back then. 
I'm unable to do anything, even though it's nothing to brag about. 
My sixth sense suddenly hit me in that instant moment. 
In this night, as I lament my powerlessness, please let me play the music box a bit longer, baby.

hitorikiri nukegara no kinou wa 
kono basho ni kimi ga inai akashi 
shiawase o nozomu hodo ni motomeatte, kizutsuketa 
hontou ni daiji na mono wa kono ude no naka ni mou atta no ni

Yesterday, when I was nothing but a lonesome empty shell, 
I was hit with the harsh reality that you were not here with me. 
The more we wished for happiness, the more we sought each other out and hurt each other, 
even though the person most precious to me was in my embrace all along.

nee, naite naite kimi o kurikaeshi motomete mo 
kotoba mo sakebi mo ukande kiete'ku kara 
nee, matte! matte moshimo kami-sama ga yurusu nara 
mou ichido dake negau yo

Say, I weep and weep and seek after you tirelessly, 
but both my words and my screams rise up and dissipate. 
Say, won't you wait? Please wait! If God would grant my wish, 
I wish for just once more.

ikura unmeiteki na suteki na deai darou ga 
kako no ore ni wa hanatsu Break it down!! 
"kou suru beki da" ga fuete kara 
fun'iki ga kootte'ru no ni miete'ta kimi Freaky Girl. 
migatte natte'ta no wa ore no hou to zange 
randebuu aru nara mochiron hande tsuku 
demo ii kara saigo no ego kitto naosu saikai shiyou tochuu kara Play ball

Although we might have had many fateful and wonderful encounters, 
they shouted to me in the past, "Break it down!!" 
I found myself saying "I should have done it this way" a lot more often, 
and you started to look like a freaky girl to me in the frigid atmosphere. 
I became very selfish and inconsiderate, and so did my repentance, 
so if we're going to meet now, of course I'll give myself a handicap. 
Please, I'll repair my last ego so that we can try to play ball one more time.

hashiru ashi ima takamaru kodou wa kokoro kara kimi o motomu shirushi 
isshun no gomakashi yori uso no nai kurushimi ga 
ureshikute nakidashisou de sono ude o tsuyoku sou tsukamitai

My dashing feet and my loud heartbeats are the proof of my heart's longing for you. 
As you speak to me hurtful words of honesty rather than deceitful lies, 
I feel like crying tears of joy and seizing your arms with mine.

nee, nando datte kimi o honki de oikakeru yo 
kaze mo aozora mo kimi-nashi ja tsumetasugite 
yuuki no kakera o kono te de nigirishimete 
mou ichido dake tsutau yo

You know, I will chase after you earnestly endlessly, 
for the wind and the blue sky are too cold without you. 
Holding tightly in my hand a fragment of courage, 
My thoughts will reach you just once more.

gouin gouin ni de mo te o torimodori omoide no aru natsukashii soko ni 
korigori nante iwaretara mou ronrii mou dou ni de mo nare to areta koudou ni 
douyou shi nozomi-doori ni wa naranai no ni iji o haru koto o ai to ii 
hen na taido ni iranai puraido ni zenbu topparatte sunao ni naru saigo ni

I forcibly took my hands back, and in that nostalgic place full of memo
                        
                    |
