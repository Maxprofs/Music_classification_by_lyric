                        Bài hát: Jimmy Jazz - Carla Bruni

The police walked in for Jimmy Jazz
I said, he ain't here, but he went past
Oh, you're looking for Jimmy Jazz, Jazz, Jazz, Jazz

Sattamassagana for Jimmy Dread
Cut off his ears and chop off his head
They came looking for Jimmy Jazz, Jazz, Jazz, Jazz

So don't take a message 'cross this town
Maybe put it down somewhere over around
See it gets to Jimmy Jazz, Jazz, Jazz, Jazz

And don't you bother me, not anymore
I can't take this tale, no, no, no more
It's all around (all around), Jimmy Jazz, Jazz, Jazz, Jazz

J-a-zee zee J-a-zed zed
J-a-zed zed
Jimmy Jazz, Jazz, Jazz, Jazz

The police walked in for Jimmy Jazz
I said, he ain't here, but he went past
Oh, they're looking for Jimmy Jazz
Hum...
