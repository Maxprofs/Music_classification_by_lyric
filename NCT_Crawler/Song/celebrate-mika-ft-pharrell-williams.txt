                        I wanna come home
 To the only place I know
 Where the trees I planted grow
 I wanna come home
 Once I get up I feel better
 And I put myself together
 I remember those two letters
 It will be O-K
 Everyone says now or never
 I say only if it's better
 Be a night like this forever
 We know better
 I want the whole world to celebrate
 I want the whole world to celebrate
 I want the whole world to celebrate
 I want the whole world to celebrate
 I'll be just fine
 When I see you at the finish line
 Doesn't matter if I take my time
 I'm coming home
 Once I get up I feel better
 And I put myself together
 I remember those two letters
 It will be O-K
 Everyone says now or never
 I say only if it's better
 Be a night like this forever
 We know better
 I want the whole world to celebrate
 I want the whole world to celebrate
 I want the whole world to celebrate
 I want the whole world to celebrate
 I'm not mad at you at all
 But I want the whole world to celebrate
 Yeah
 Mmmmm
 Right about now it's time for everybody to stand up
 Stand up, stand up
 And have fun
 Cause we just begun
 I want the whole world to celebrate
 Let's go
 Once I get up I feel better
 And I put myself together
 I remember those two letters
 It will be O-K
 Everyone says now or never
 I say only if it's better
 Be a night like this forever
 We know better
 I wanna go home
 And celebrate
 I wanna go home
 And celebrate
 I wanna go home
 And celebrate
 I wanna go home
 And celebrate
 I want the whole world to celebrate
