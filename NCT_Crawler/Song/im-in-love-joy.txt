                        I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love 

I was alone, all on my own today
No one to phone, no one to share my way
Suddenly you came into my life
Oh baby, what can I do?

I'm in love - oh, what can I do?
I'm in love - oh, what can I do?
Now I'm down on my knees
And I'm begging you please
Can't you see that I'm so much in love
I'm in love (I'm in love) - Oh, what can I do?
I'm in love (I'm in love) – Oh, what can I do?
For sometimes I feel glad
And sometimes I feel blue
Won't you let me know that you will love me too?

Running around, searching you night and day
Where did you go? Won't you come back and stay?
Could it be love or just an affair?
Would it be love – oh, show me you care!
Give me your call, and I promise 
I'll be there

I'm in love - oh, what can I do 
I'm in love - oh, what can I do
Now I'm down on my knees
And I'm begging you please
Can't you see that I'm so much in love
I'm in love (I'm in love) - oh, what can I do?
I'm in love (I'm in love) - oh, what can I do?
I'm so lonesome tonight
And I can't see the light
Won't you let me know that you will love me too?

I'm in love , I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love
I'm in love - oh, what can I do
I'm in love - oh, what can I do 
Now I'm down on my knees
And I'm begging you please
Can't you see that I'm so much in love
I'm in love (I'm in love) - oh, what can I do?
I'm in love (I'm in love) - oh, what can I do?
I'm so lonesome tonight 
And I can't see the light
Can't you see that I'm so much in love
I'm in love (I'm in love) - oh what can I do?
I'm in love (I'm in love) - oh what can I do?
You're the queen of my heart
Don't you tear me apart
Can't you see that I'm so much in love?
I'm in love
