                        Luz, yo quiero ver luz
 Poder pintar de color un nuevo amanecer
 Vivir, amar,
 Sentir y saber que Hoy, puede que no salga el sol
 Aunque llueva
 TÃº y yo sabremos bailar
 Nadie nos puede parar We're dancing in the rain
 Dancing in the rain Life, gets you every time
 Open up ,
 You never know what you will find
 You never know what waits inside So, live
 Like you'll never stop
 Take this chance
 And give it everything you've got
 Come on and let the rhythm drop We're dancing in the rain
 Dancing in the rain Keep on like it's never ending
 Keep on till the light of day
 Keep on dancing in the rain
 The rain, the rain Deja caer
 Deja la lluvia caer
 The rain, the rain, the rain Deja caer
 Deja la lluvia caer
 The rain, the rain, the rain The Rain, the rain
 Dancing
 Dancing
 Dancing Dancing Deja caer
 Deja la lluvia caer Aunque llueva y nos mojemos
 No pararemos de bailar Keep on dancing in the rain
 The rain, the rain Lyrics in English Light, I want to see light
 Paint the break of dawn
 Live, love
 Feel and know that Today, the sun may not rise
 But even if it rains
 You and I will dance
 No one can stop us We're dancing in the rain
 Dancing in the rain Life, gets you every time
 Open up ,
 You never know what you will find
 You never know what waits inside So, live
 Like you'll never stop
 Take this chance
 And give it everything you've got
 Come on and let the rhythm drop We're dancing in the rain
 Dancing in the rain Keep on like it's never ending
 Keep on till the light of day
 Keep on dancing in the rain
 The rain, the rain Let it come down
 Let the rain come down
 The rain, the rain, the rain Let it come down
 Let the rain come down
 The rain, the rain, the rain The Rain, the rain Dancing
 Dancing
 Dancing Dancing Let it come down
 Let the rain come down Even if it rains and we get wet
 We won't stop dancing Keep on dancing in the rain
 The rain, the rain
