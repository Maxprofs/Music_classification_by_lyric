                        Song: Hey Hey Hey - Katy Perry

A big beautiful brain with a pretty face, yeah
A baby doll with a briefcase, yeah
A hot little hurricane
'Cause I'm feminine and soft, but I'm still a boss, yeah
Red lipstick but still so raw, yeah
Marilyn Monroe in a monster truck

'Cause I can be zen and I can be the storm, yeah
I smell like a rose and I pierce like a thorn, yeah
Karate chopping, the clichés and norms, all in a dress

Hey, hey, hey
You think that I'm a little ba-a-by
You think that I am fragile like a Fabergé
You think that I am cracking, but you can't break me
No-o-o-o-oh, no way
No-o-o-o-oh, no way
No-o-o-o-oh, no way
You think that I am cracking, but you can't break me
Break break, break me

Yeah, I bounce back like a pro 'cause I'm so resilient
LOL at all your limits
Keep your penny thoughts, I'm making a mint

'Cause I can be zen and I can be the storm, yeah
I smell like a rose and I pierce like a thorn, yeah
Karate chopping, the clichés and norms, all in a dress

Hey, hey, hey
You think that I'm a little ba-a-by
You think that I am fragile like a Fabergé
You think that I am cracking, but you can't break me
No-o-o-o-oh, no way
No-o-o-o-oh, no way
No-o-o-o-oh, no way
You think that I am cracking, but you can't break me
Break break, break me

I ain't got no strings
(No strings, no strings, no strings)
I'm no one's little puppet
Got my own cha ching
In my chubby little wallet
And secretly you love it
(You *** love it)
And secretly you love it

Hey, hey, hey
You think that I'm a little ba-a-by
You think that I am fragile like a Fabergé
You think that I am cracking, but you can't break me
No-o-o-o-oh
Hey, hey, hey
You think that I'm a little ba-a-by
You think that I am fragile like a Fabergé
You think that I am cracking, but you can't break me
No-o-o-o-oh, no way (no)
No-o-o-o-oh, no way (no way)
No-o-o-o-oh, no way
You think that I am cracking, but you can't break me
Break break, break me
