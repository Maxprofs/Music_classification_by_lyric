                        Bài hát: Heartthrob - Father

[Intro]
Better call the cops
I'm 'bout to run up on yo' block
Take *** that don't belong to me
They say that something wrong with me
Red rum, red rum (eh)
Hoodlum, I'm dumb (yeah)
Dusk dawn hell spawn (woah)
We don't get along

[Verse 1]
Rock with it, lean with it
Styrofoam with lean in it
Party not popping, less my whole *** team in it
Glenwood, hitting jugg's
Niggas wish that they was good
But niggas couldn't keep it real
But I don't hold no ill will
I ain't got no ana', and you ain't got no stamina
So nigga don't you come at me
We know you ain't got no family
You ain't got no crew
Cause they don't keep it real with you
Niggas keep it real with me
Despite all of my savagery

[Hook]
No matter what I steal, or all the niggas that I rob
Living on the west side
Pretty black heartthrob
The way I used to make her feel
I miss when we were only friends
Juggin' in the west end
Touching in the Westin
No matter what I steal, or all the niggas that I rob
Living on the west side
Pretty black heartthrob
The way I used to make her feel
I miss when we were only friends
Juggin' in the west end
Touching in the Westin

[Verse 2]
Big house Duplex (yeah)
Suplex, who next (woah)
Russian roulette (yeah)
Bullet through neck (eh)
Brett Hart, sharpshooter
Scamming bitches on computers
Future in my hands
Popped a vyvanse, blew five bands
Hang time, gang signs
Use you're hands, fusion dance
Stay in school
So tinted
Oprah Winfrey, we ain't cool
So the whips is bullet proof
Getting throat in a jeep
A nigga ran off the streets
Say they got evidence on me
But that *** ain't concrete

[Hook]
No matter what I steal, or all the niggas that I rob
Living on the west side
Pretty black heartthrob
The way I used to make her feel
I miss when we were only friends
Juggin' in the west end
Touching in the Westin
No matter what I steal, or all the niggas that I rob
Living on the west side
Pretty black heartthrob
The way I used to make her feel
I miss when we were only friends
Juggin' in the west end
Touching in the Westin

[Outro]
Better call the cops
I'm 'bout to run up on yo' block
Take *** that don't belong to me
They say that something wrong with me
Red rum, red rum (eh)
Hoodlum, I'm dumb (yeah)
Dusk dawn hell spawn (woah)
We don't get along
