                        Bài hát: I Know What You Did Last Summer - Shawn Mendes, Camila Cabello

He knows dirty secrets that I keep
Does he know it’s killin’ me?
He knows, he knows
Does he know another’s hands have touched my skin?

I won’t tell him where I’ve been
He knows...
He knows...
He knows...

It’s tearing me apart
And she’s slipping away
I’m slipping away...
Am I just hanging on to all the words she used to say?
The pictures on her phone
And she’s not coming home
(I’m not coming home)
Coming home, coming home
I know what you did last summer
Just lie to me, there is no other
I know what you did last summer
Tell me where you’ve been
I know what you did last summer
Look me in the eyes, my lover
I know what you did last summer
Tell me where you’ve been

I know, I know, I know, I know
I know, I know, I know
I know, I know, I know, I know
I know, I know, I know
I didn’t mean it, no
I didn’t mean it, mean it, no
Can’t seem to let you go
Can’t seem to hold you close

I know when she looks me in the eyes
They don’t seem as bright
No more, no more, I know
But she loved me at one time
Would I promise her that night
Cross my heart and hope to die

It’s tearing me apart (It’s tearing me apart
And she’s slipping away (I’m slipping away)
Am I just hanging on to all the words she used to say?
The pictures on her phone (The pictures on her phone)
And she’s not coming home (I’m not coming home)
Oh, na na na, ah yeah

I know what you did last summer
Just lie to me, there is no other
I know what you did last summer
Tell me where you’ve been
I know what you did last summer
Look me in the eyes, my lover
I know what you did last summer
Tell me where you’ve been

I know, I know, I know, I know
I know, I know, I know
I know, I know, I know, I know
I know, I know, I know
Can’t seem to let you go
Can’t seem to keep you close
Hold me close
I can’t seem to let you go
I can’t seem to keep you close
You know I didn’t mean it though
Tell me where you’ve been lately
Tell me where you’ve been lately
Just hold me close
Tell me where you’ve been lately
Tell me where you’ve been lately
Don’t, don’t, don’t, don’t let me go
I can’t seem to keep you close
I can’t seem to let you go
I didn’t mean it though
I know you didn’t mean it though
I know you didn’t mean it though
I don’t wanna let you go, no no no
Tell me you didn’t mean it though
Tell me you didn’t mean it though
Can’t seem to let you go, seem to let you go
I know you didn’t mean it though
I wanna know you need it though
Hold me close
I know you didn’t mean it though
I know you didn’t mean it though
Just hold me close
I can’t seem to let you go
Can’t seem to hold you close

I know what you did last summer
Just lie to me, there is no other
I know what you did last summer
Tell me where you’ve been
I know what you did last summer
Look me in the eyes, my lover
I know what you did last summer
Tell me where you’ve been

I know, I know, I know, I know
I know, I know, I know
I know, I know, I know, I know
I know, I know, I know
I know, I know, I know, I know
I know, I know, I know
I know, I know, I know, I know
I know, I know, I know
