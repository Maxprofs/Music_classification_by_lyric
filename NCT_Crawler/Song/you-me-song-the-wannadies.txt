                        Always will we find
 I tried to make you love
 'Til every thing's forgotten
 I know you hate that Bop badada, bop bop bop bop
 Bop badada, bop bop bop bop Always will we fight
 Kiss you once or twice
 And every thing's forgotten
 I know you hate that I love your Sunday song
 The week's not yet begun
 And everything is quiet
 And it's always You and me, always and forever
 You and me, always and forever
 Bop bop bop bop bop
 It was always you and me, always You tell me I'm a real man
 I try to look impressed
 Not very convincing
 But you know I love it I know we watch TV
 'Til we fall asleep
 Not very exciting
 But it's you and me And we'll always be together
 You and me, always and forever
 Bop bop bop bop bop
 It was always you and me, always and forever
 You and me, always and forever Bop bop bop bop bop
 It was always you and me, always and forever
 You and me, always and forever
 Bop bop bop bop bop
                        
                    |
