It's alright to feel however you want to
There's no limitation no
Fill up your life, let me see your hands up one time
We celebrate mine, cause I ain't gonna get no more
So we can do this all night
One time, everybody say ay ay oh

There's a feeling that I got that I can't give up
Feeling in my heart that I can't get over
I know that it's coming like the sun come up
Tell me do you feel like say, everybody say

If you wanna touch the sky, hands in the air one time
All night, no doubt it
I'mma live it loud like there's only one life
Have to live it up, one life, have to live it up

There's a feeling that I got that I can't give up
Feeling in my heart that I can't get over
I know that it's coming like the sun come up
Tell me do you feel like say, everybody say

Party people say, party people say
