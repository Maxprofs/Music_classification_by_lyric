                        Bài hát: Life After You - Daughtry

Ten miles from town
And I just broke down
Spittin' out smoke on the side of the road
I'm out here alone
Just tryin' to get home
To tell you I was wrong but you already know
Believe me I won't stop at nothin'
To see you so I've started runnin'

All that I'm after is a life full of laughter
As long as I'm laughing with you
I'm thinkin' that all that still matters is love ever after
After the life we've been through
'Cause I know there's no life after you.

Last time we talked,
The night that I walked
Burns like an iron in the back of my mind
I must've been high to say you and I
Weren't meant ot be
And just wasting my time
Oh, why did I ever doubt you?
You know I woule die here without you.

All that I'm after is a life full of laughter
As long as I'm laughing with you
I'm thinkin' that all that still matters is love ever after
After the life we've been through
'Cause I know there's no life after you.
You and I, right or wrong, there's no other one
After this time I spent alone
It's hard to believe that a man with sight could be so blind
Thinkin' 'bout the better times,
Must've been outta my mind
So I'm runnin' back to tell you
All that I'm after is a life full of laughter
Without you God knows what I'd do yeahh

All that I'm after is a life full of laughter
As long as I'm laughing with you
I'm thinkin' that all that still matters is love ever after
After the life we've been through
I know there's no life after you.
Know there's no life after you
Know there's no life after you
Know there's no life after you
Know there's no life after you yeah
