                        Bài hát: Imaginary Parties - Superfruit

Go to imaginary parties in our make believe Ferrari
Baby let's get fresh I know we know how

Come a little closer baby we can pretend like I'm the new kid in town
Take me for a ride around if that's what you like, but if you're driving I'm down
We can make a movie baby you could be Gable and I can be Wes
Call me Tarantino because you and me know that it's what I do best

I, oh I wanna make it better than it's ever been before
And I, oh I gotta keep it, gotta keep it coming back

If it's all we ever wanted then baby play along
('Cause it makes me feel alive)
Go to imaginary parties in our make believe Ferrari
Baby let's get fresh it's like we just met
If you wanna catch fire, we get a little hotter
(Wanna keep you satisfied)
Just you and me together in our imitation leathers
Baby let's get fresh I know we know how

Tell me 'bout fantasy 'cause I can do anything and don't you hold back
I can call the shots and you can call me what you want oh baby how about that
(How about that)
I can be a doctor if you show me what hurts and I can make it all right
(Make it all right)
We can have a slumber party, you show me yours and I'll be showing you mine

Oh I, oh I wanna make it better than it's ever been before
And I, oh I gotta keep it, gotta keep it coming back

If it's all we ever wanted then baby play along
('Cause it makes me feel alive)
Go to imaginary parties in our make believe Ferrari
Baby let's get fresh it's like we just met
If you wanna catch fire, we get a little hotter
(Wanna keep you satisfied)
Just you and me together in our imitation leathers
Baby let's get fresh I know we know how

If it's all we ever wanted then baby play along
('Cause it makes me feel alive)
Go to imaginary parties in our make believe Ferrari
Baby let's get fresh it's like we just met
If you wanna catch fire, we get a little hotter
(Wanna keep you satisfied)
Just you and me together in our imitation leathers
Baby let's get fresh I know we know how
