Why do we break up
if we're just gonna make up
Shawty, I don't know
I just can't let go

Why do we break up
If we're just gonna make uo
Shawty, I don't know
Ijust can't let go

Hold up Hold up
you said you loved me
But then But then
You wanna leave me

Why don't you just
Make up your mind?
You come you cry
Saying you're sorry
I kiss you and say
You are my baby

But then it starts over
Cause girl you're just
Driving me crazy

We U-ups and downs.
But I'm Still Loving You now
When you try to leave
For Awhile.
And you come back
With a Smile

So answer this question girl
Just answer this question girl.
Why do we

If we're just gonna make uo
Shawty, I don't know
Ijust can't let go

When you leave me
Then you come back

But I'm tired of playing
This game
And theree is on thing that
I gotta say That i gotta say
So baby just sit with me

We U-ups and downs.
But I'm Still Loving You now
When you try to leave
For Awhile.
And you come back
With a Smile
