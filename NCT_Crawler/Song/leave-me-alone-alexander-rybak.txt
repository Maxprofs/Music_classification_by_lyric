                        It started with a phone I stupidly answered
You said you got my number from one of the dancers
You waited right outside, you had something of mine
But then I saw your eyes, your crazy eyes

Now you’ve got me into something very sick and twisted
An evil kind of game I didn’t know existed
You travel overseas to terrorise me
And I don’t understand, why can’t you let me be?

Believe me when I say, you stupid fool
You’re scaring me to death, that’s not cool
Why won’t you leave me alone? Just leave me alone
You’re crazy, leave me alone

I’m begging you to stop and think this through
It’s time you started playing with someone new
Why won’t you leave me alone? Just leave me alone
You’re crazy, leave me alone

You’re scaring mom and dad, scaring off my girlfriend
You’re waiting by my door early in the morning
I’ve told you many times, don’t follow me at night
You’re poisoning my life, just tell my why

Believe me when I say, you stupid fool
You’re scaring me to death, that’s not cool
Why won’t you leave me alone? Just leave me alone
You’re crazy, leave me alone

I’m begging you to stop and think this through
It’s time you started playing with someone new
Why won’t you leave me alone? Just leave me alone
You’re crazy, leave me alone

Believe me when I say, you stupid fool
You’re scaring me to death, that’s not cool
Why won’t you leave me alone? Just leave me alone
You’re crazy, leave me alone

I’m begging you to stop and think this through
It’s time you started playing with someone new
Why won’t you leave me alone? Just leave me alone
You’re crazy, leave me alone
