                        In Heaven's name, why are you walkin' away?
 Hang on to your love
 In Heaven's name, why do you play these games?
 Hang on to your love Take time if you're down on luck
 It's so easy to walk out on love
 Take your time if the going gets tough
 It's so precious So if you want it to get stronger, you'd better not let go
 You've got to hold on longer if you want your love to grow
 Got to stick together, hand in glove
 Hold tight, don't fight
 Hang on to your love In Heaven's name, why are you walkin' away?
