                        Sipping on this drink, have some time to think
 About where I was, and where I'm at today
 I'm getting everything I ask for
 Flying the world, filling up my passport I'm in the zone, martini's strong,
 My tall is short, but my money long
 I'm getting everything I ask for,
 In the club, always keep my glass full Money in the bank, my car brand new
 I got everything I want, but you
 I might get you one day, I might get you one day
 House on a hill, Hollywood view, got everything I want but you
 I might get you one day, I might get you one day Hey, everybody came to play
 I love it when the DJ, plays all my favorite songs
 And everybody sings along, I see the pretty babies in the pool
 But all I can think about is you Money in the bank, my car brand new
 I got everything I want, but you
 I might get you one day, I might get you one day
 House on a hill, Hollywood view, got everything I want but you
 I might get you one day, I might get you one day When I get you girl, you're gonna be so in love with me
 Everyday, we're gonna play, what's your fantasy?
 Every night I think of you in every way
 And when it get ya, I'mma celebrate
 I'mma celebrate, I'mma celebrate
 I'm gonna celebrate, 'cause I'mma get you one day
