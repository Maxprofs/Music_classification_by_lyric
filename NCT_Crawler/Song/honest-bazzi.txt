                        Bài hát: Honest - Bazzi

If we had just been honest
Gonna turn my read receipts on
Just to let you know I won't respond
Darling asked me to do this
But I'm not looking for excuses
And I deleted all your info
'Cause I heard about the info
Always knew that you be ruthless
But I never thought that you could do this, oh

And the ***-up part is I gave y'all the intro
That was my dude, why you gotta pick him though?
I was selfish in the way that I acted
I keep doing things just to get a reaction

Ya, I wonder if he still hit you now, *** you like I used to
I know you think about all the things that we did when he's with you
And do you feel no shame?
Does he make you feel the same?
'Cause we have got what we wanted
Oh, if we had just been honest
Why can't we just be honest
If we had just been honest

Remember (ya)
Late night, smokin', we under stop projectors
Looked in my eyes where the smiles forever
I think we both know what was said, boy, this was goin'
But the sex is too good we got caught up in the moonlight
Now you took my best friend and turn him into my opponent, oh yeah, yeah, yeah

Did you forget that I gave y'all the intro
That was my dude, why you gotta pick him though?
I was selfish in the way that I acted
I keep doing things just to get your reaction

Ya, I wonder if he still hit you now, *** you like I used to
I know you think about all the things that we did when he's with you
And do you feel no shame?
Does he make you feel the same?
'Cause we have got what we wanted
Oh, if we had just been honest
Why can't we just be honest
If we had just been honest
If we had just been honest

Maybe it's the pills
Maybe it's the drugs
Maybe it's the pride
                        
                    |
