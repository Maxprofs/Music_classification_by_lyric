                        Bài hát: Jackie (B.M.F.) - Ciara 

Jackie was a girl, more than just a girl
She always had big dreams
To see the whole world fall in love
And do what her heart believed
But mama said "baby girl be tough
Everything ain't what it seems"
I had to go through the things she went through
I now know what it means
Harmony drop that beat

I'm a bad mah'fucker
I'm a bad mah'fucker
I'm a bad mah'fucker
I'm a bad motherfucker

Can't even hate cause you know this *** hot
Yeah I'm that bitch, like it or not
Better get ready cause I'm not gon' stop, stop, stop
Let that beat drop
A lot of these bitches they came and they went
I got a few things I'ma get off my chest
Please don't act like you ain't heard what I said, heard what I said
You heard what I said

I'ma B.M.F
Shawty put my initials on it, on it
I'ma B.M.F
I'ma put you all up on it, on it
[x2]

Imagine delivering a 9 pound 10 ounce baby
I'm a bad motherfucker
Turn up
I'm bad, I'm bad

I'm a bad mah'fucker
I'm a bad mah'fucker

[Intro]
This song's for you
And you, and you, and you

[Verse 1]
*** a blog
I ain't holding back, I'm going off
You said you see me though
But I was in Madrid about a week ago
Run your, run your mouth
All this hating on me need to go and find a job
No subliminals, You worry about my biz
Worry about your business ho

[Pre-Hook]
Oh, have you been through what I've been through?
Man, you'll be popping this *** too
Oh, every time that I come through, I come through
They say that

[Hook]
I'm a bad motherfucker, I'm a bad motherfucker
I'm a bad motherfucker, bad bad
I'm a bad motherfucker, I'm a bad motherfucker
I'm a bad motherfucker, bad bad

[Verse 2]
Just a thought, you don't want to see me, not at all
What you tripping for?
If I don't rock with you, don't take it personal
I'm from the dirty, dirty south
I said it and I mean it
Now you know what I'm about
No subliminals, you worry about my bizz
Worry 'bout your ninnies ho

[Pre-Hook]

[Hook]

[Bridge]
You wanna get up in my head, don't ya?
Deep down inside you wanna be me so bad, don't ya?
Ooh, I know you hate it when you see me smile
Get used to it, I'mma be here for a while, oh
Bad motherfucker, bad bad motherfucker
Bad bad motherfucker, bad bad
I'm a bad motherfucker, I'm a bad motherfucker
I'm a bad motherfucker, bad bad

[Hook]

[Interlude]
See I'm just too bad for these motherfuckers
We gotta pop *** every time
Every now and then you know
Yeah, I'm talking to you

[Pre-Hook x2]

[Outro]
Damn it's so so sad
That I make you that mad
When when when when when
                        
                    |
