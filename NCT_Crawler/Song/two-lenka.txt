                        Song: Two - Lenka

Two, now that I'm with you
Another point of view
Instead of what I knew

Oh two, whatever will we do 
I don't see a way through
But you're the one I choose 

I never knew what double could do
But things are better, so much better

Hold me closer, never let me go
I don't want any other baby
Two is the one, two is the one
I was lonely, never had nobody
But now I've got double, baby
Two is the one, two is the one for me

One, never had so much fun
Staying up till sun
Banging on my own drum

One, always looking for love 
And ending up with none
Made me come undone 

I never knew what double could do
But things are better, so much better with two

Hold me closer, never let me go
I don't want any other baby
Two is the one, two is the one
I was lonely, never had nobody
But now I've got double, baby
Two is the one, two is the one for me

Two, a couple, not a few
Well, this is something new
If I can deal with it then so can you
I never knew what double could do
But things are better, so much better

Hold me closer, never let me go
I don't want any other baby
Two is the one, two is the one
I was lonely, never had nobody
But now I've got double, baby
I never knew what double could do
But things are better, so much better with two 

So much better with two
So much better with two
So much better with two
                        
                    |
