Jonas Brothers - Just Friends

There she goes again
The girl I'm in love with
It's cool we're just friends
We walk the halls at school
We know it's casual
It's cool we're just...

I don't want to lead you on, no
But the truth is I've grown fond, yeah

Everyone knows it's meant to be
Falling in love, just you and me
Till the end of time
Till I'm on her mind
It'll happen
I've been making lots of plans
Like a pickett fence and a rose garden
I'll just keep on dreaming
But it's cool, cause we're just friends

Small talk on IM
Just one word sentences
It's cool we're just friends
If I had my way
We'd talk and talk all day, yeah

Everyone knows it's meant to be
Falling in love, just you and me
Till the end of time
Till I'm on her mind
It'll happen
I've been making lots of plans
Like a pickett fence and a rose garden
I'll just keep on dreaming
But it's cool, cause we're just friends

Thinking about how we're gonna say our vows
It's cool we're just friends
She walks down the aisle
I see all my friends smile
Cause now we're more than friends

Everyone knows it's meant to be
Falling in love, just you and me
Till the end of time
Till I'm on your mind
It'll happen
We've been making lots of plans
Like a pickett fence and a rose garden
I'll just keep on dreaming
Just keep on thinking of
When we used to be just friends

La la la la
La la la la
La la la la la
(When we used to be)
When we used to be
La la la la
La la la la
La la la la la
When we used to be just friends
