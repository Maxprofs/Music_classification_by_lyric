                        Bài hát: Shake It Off - Tiffany Alvord

I stay out too late
Got nothing in my brain
That’s what people say
mmm mmm
That’s what people say
mmm mmm
I go on too many dates
I can’t make ‘em stay
At least that’s what people say
Mmm mmm
That’s what people say
mmm mmm
But I keep cruising
Can’t stop, won’t stop moving
It’s like I got this music
In my mind 
Saying it’s gonna be alright
Cuz the players gonna play
play play play play 
And the haters gonna hate hate hate hate hate 
Baby I’m just gonna shake shake shake shake shake
Shake it off
Shake it off
Heartbreakers gonna break
break break break break
and the faker gonna fake fake fake fake fake
Baby 
I’m just gonna shake shake shake shake shake
I Shake it off
I Shake it off
I never miss a beat
I’m lightening on my feet
and that’s what they don’t see
mmm mmm
That’s what they don’t see
mmm mmm
I’m dancing on my own
(Dancing on my own)
I make the moves up as I go
(Moves up as I go)
And that’s what they don’t know
mmm mmm
That’s what they don’t know
mmm mmm
But I keep cruising
Can’t stop, won’t stop grooving
It’s like I got this music
In my mind 
Saying it’s gonna be alright
Cuz the players gonna play play play play play 
And the haters gonna hate hate hate hate hate 
Baby I’m just gonna shake shake shake shake shake
Shake it off
Shake it off
Heartbreakers gonna break
break break break break
and the fakers gonna fake fake fake fake fake
Baby 
I’m just gonna shake shake shake shake shake
Shake it off
Shake it off
Shake it off
Shake it off
I I shake if off
I Shake it Off
I I Shake it off
I Shake it Off
I I Shake it Off
I Shake it Off
Hey Hey Hey Just think while you’ve been getting down and out about the liars
and the dirty dirty cheats of the world
You could have been getting down to this sick beat
My ex man brought his new girlfriend
She’s like oh my God
but I’m just gonna shake
and to the fellow over there
with the hella good hair
Won’t you come over baby
We can shake shake shake
Cuz the players gonna play
play play play play 
And the haters gonna hate
hate hate hate hate 
I’m just gonna shake shake shake shake shake
Shake it off
I Shake it off
Heartbreakers gonna break
break break break break
and the Fakers gonna fake
fake fake fake fake
Baby 
I’m just gonna shake shake shake shake shake
Shake it off 
I Shake if off
Shake it off
I Shake it off
I I I I shake if off
I Shake it off
I I I I shake if off
I shake if off
I Shake it Off
