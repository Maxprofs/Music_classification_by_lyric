                        Tomorrow is ending
 As fast as I'm spending
 Most days I'm pretending
 I'm hyper-extending All my dreams
 And all my uncertainties
 On to a speedin' train Where does the time go
 And what have I done
 The days keep getting shorter
 And I'm still on the run
 I'm losing the battle
 I'm living with shadows
 Where did the time
 Hell if I know The summers are shorter
 My sister's older
 She cries on my shoulder
 I'm crossing the border With all my dreams and all my uncertainties
 Onto a speeding train Eyes closed
 I'm remembering why
 People come and go
 Like dominoes
 The days keep passing by
 I realize
 I never learned how to fly
 Is there still time
 Is there still time Where did the time go
 And what have I done
 The days keep getting shorter
 And I'm still on the run
 I'm losing the battle
 I'm living with shadows
 Where did the time go
 Hell if I know
                        
                    |
