                        Yeah, yeah
 'Last Of The Mohicans' man, let's go
 You'll never take me alive
 It's time DJ, wake 'em up
 I'd like to introduce you all to somebody
 Somebody very dear I'm here to put you all through the pressure like nobody ever
 'Cause everytime I shoot nothing but fo' n beta
 An' them slugs get heada' your way any day fella
 'Cause when murder reigns you gona' need umbrellas Kevlar an' a whole lot of gun runners
 You hotdog niggas hide your relish
 Ain't *** to tell us I keep the army
 An' they stay armed- best stay the *** from 'round me Unless your desire leads you to touch the dream
 I be in back of the back AG on the jeans
 Hit the button to the left an' you can see how it leans
 This thang is like an' airplane you park in the street, mean It's so vicious call me young, all the wishes
 'Cause I wished for it all, beg the Lord for forgiveness
 'Cause I sin, I'ma sinner, but I win, I'ma winner
 I'm runnin' the marathon an' y'all niggas are sprinters I exercise more mental an' massage my fingers
 I'm lookin' forward to bangin' out start to finish
 Give me a minute let me explain why most niggas is timid
 They runnin' round with good bodies an' no hearts in 'em Makin' it easy fo' a nigga to get 'em- expose em'
 Witness Rule the chosen man who spit it the coldest
 Load up this ten shot, till y'all niggas the hole-est
 I'ma God send- niggas better act like they know this mutha***a Your game ain't nuthin' but smoke an' mirrors
 (Let 'em know)
 Y'all clowns can't be serious, uh huh
 Many has tried but y'all can't kill us
 We still livin' this real vivid- we real niggas
 (Nigga) Your game ain't nuthin' but smoke an' mirrors, uh huh
 We ain't neva scared I hope all y'all hear us
 Many has tried but y'all can't kill us
 We still livin' this real vivid- we kill, killers The world is blind so now I gotta spit it in braille
 That raw coked up flow you can put in the scales
 So when niggas start dyin' can't nobody tell, it's jus'
 An' overdose injection of that braille, Rule When I come thru' can't nobody move me
 I'm exclusive cop some new *** every Tuesday
 Excuse me- bitch, I'm one of a kind
 When I die study my mind an' dupe' the design Now I'm inclined people say tha' I'm ahead of my time
 Whoever said that they must'a had they nose on tha' line
 I'm not even in my prime yet, a veteran in thismutha***in' rap ***
 What religion you practice, a pristical baptist or catholic I can't really say I'm religious an' to that I'ma witness
 But I'm spiritual that's why I keep the Lord in the picture
 40 Cal in the 7-40 I laugh at niggas
 That wanna' get buried in cemeteries next to they bitches An' get thrown wit' bricks tied to they Lebron's
 The game we play is chess them niggas is pawns
 You the first pieces we take off the board
 Because I'ma king that's from Queens an' Then it's the whole regime, beta' known as the team
 Big shout to my nigga Preme, it ain't nothin' illegal
 About keepin' ya' cash clean when you sellin'
 Millions of records, an' send me some jeans mutha***a Your game ain't nuthin' but smoke an' mirrors
 (Let 'em know)
 Y'all clowns can't be serious, uh huh
 Many has tried but y'all can't kill us
 We still livin' this real vivid, we real niggas
 (Nigga) Your game ain't nuthin' but smoke an' mirrors, uh huh
 We ain't neva scared I hope all y'all hear us
 Many has tried but y'all can't kill us
 We still livin' this real vivid we kill, killers Yeah, you know, uh
 Wha'cha'll don't know?
 There's nothin' real about these niggas in this game
 This is it Murder Inc nigga, you lookin' at 'em The realest mutha***in' niggas in the game, you starin' at 'em
 Ain't no need to look nowhere else, it's murder niggas
 Holla, we ridin', you know, c'mon niggas
 It's danger, it's danger What up to my nigga Merc, Big Caddy
 My nigga Black Child, rest in peace
 To our mutha***in' soldier up in Heaven
 My nigga Do Cannons, Do Cannons We see you nigga, we love you nigga
 Shadow I see you nigga
 We gon' pour out a lil' liquor
 We gon' have some fun
 We gon' ride this mutha***a' out
 It's murda', real talk nigga
