- Gravity -

Gravity
is working against me
And gravity
wants to bring me down
Oh I'll never know what makes this man
With all the love that his heart can stand
Dream of ways to throw it all away

Oh Gravity
is working against me
And gravity
wants to bring me down
Oh twice as much aint twice as good
And can't sustain like one half could
That's gonna send me to my knees

Oh twice as much aint twice as good
And can't sustain like one half could
It's wanting more
That's gonna send me to my knees

Oh gravity,
stay the hell away from me
And gravity
has taken better men than me
(Now how can that be?)
Just keep me where the light is
Just keep me where the light is
Just keep me where the light is
Come on, keep me where the light is

Come on, keep me where the light is
