Âu Mỹ khác|

                        It's been a long and winding journey
But I'm finally here tonight
Picking up the pieces
And walking back into the night
Into the sunset of your glory
Where my heart and future lies
There's nothing like that feeling
When I look into your eyes

My dreams came true
When I found you
I found you
My miracle...


If you could see what I see
You're the answers to my prayers
If you could feel the tenderness I feel
You would know it would be clear
That angels brought me here

Standing here before you 
Feels like I've been born again
Every breathe is ur love
Every heartbeat speaks your name

My dreams came true
Right here in front of you
My miracle...

If you could see what I see
You're the answers to my prayers
If you could feel the tenderness I feel
You would know it would be clear
That angels brought me here


They brought me here to be with you
I'll be forever greatful-grateful
Oh forever faithful
My dreams came true
When I found you
My miracle...

If you could see what I see
You're the answers to my prayers
If you could feel the tenderness I feel
You would know it would be clear
That angels brought me hereeeeeeeeeeee...

If you could feel the tenderness I feel
You would know it would be clear
That angels brought me here
                        
                    |
