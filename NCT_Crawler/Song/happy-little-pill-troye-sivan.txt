                        Bài hát: Happy Little Pill - Troye Sivan

In the crowd, alone
And every second passing, reminds me I’m not home
Bright lights and city sounds are ringing like a drone, 
Unknown, unknown 

Oh glazed eyes, empty hearts
Buying happy from shopping carts
Nothing but time to kill, sipping life from bottles
Tight skin, bodyguards, Gucci down the boulevard,
Cocaine, dollar bills and

My happy little pill 
Take me away 
Dry my eyes 
Bring colour to my skies 
My sweet little pill 
Take my hunger
Light within
Numb my skin

Like a rock, I float
Sweat and conversations, seep into my bones 
Four walls are not enough, I’ll take a dip into the 
Unknown, unknown 

Oh glazed eyes, empty hearts
Buying happy from shopping carts
Nothing but time to kill, sipping life from bottles 
Tight skin, bodyguards, Gucci down the boulevard,
Cocaine, dollar bills and

My happy little pill 
Take me away 
Dry my eyes 
Bring colour to my skies 
My sweet little pill 
Take my hunger 
Light within 
Numb my skin 

Glazed eyes, empty hearts
Buying happy from shopping carts
Nothing but time to kill, sipping life from bottles 
Tight skin, bodyguards, Gucci down the boulevard,
Cocaine, dollar bills and

My happy little pill 
Take me away 
Dry my eyes 
Bring colour to my skies 
My sweet little pill 
Take my hunger 
Light within 
Numb my skin
                        
                    |
