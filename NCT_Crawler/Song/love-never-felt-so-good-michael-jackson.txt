                        Bài hát: Love Never Felt So Good - Michael Jackson

One, two, three
Baby, love never felt so good
And I doubt if it ever could
Not like you hold me, hold me
Oh baby
Love never felt so fine
And I doubt if it's ever mine
Not like you hold me, hold me
And the night's gonna be just fine
Gotta fly, Gotta see, I can't wait,
I can't take it cause

Baby,
Every time I love you
In and out my life
In and out baby
Tell me
If you really love me
It's in and out my life
In and out baby
So baby
Love never felt so good

Oh baby
Love never felt so fine (so fine)
And I doubt if it's ever mine
Not like you hold me, hold me
Oh baby
Love never felt so good
And I doubt if it ever could
Not like you hold me, hold me
And the night through the thickest tears,
Gotta fly, gotta sing, can't believe
I can't take it cause

Baby
Every time I love you
It's in and out my life
In and out baby
Tell me
If you really love
It's in and out my life
Driving me crazy
Baby
Love never felt so good

Oh baby
Love never felt so fine
And I doubt if it's mine all mine
Not like you hold me, hold me
Oh baby
Love never felt so good (so good)
And I doubt if it ever could
Not like you hold me, hold me
And the nights, that feels good (feel so good)
Gotta fly, gotta sing, can't believe
I can't take it cause

Baby
Everytime I love you
It's in and out my life
In and out baby
Tell me
If you really love me
It's in and out my life
Driving me crazy
Cause baby
Love never felt so good
Never felt so good (oh)
It never felt so good
Never felt so good
It never felt so good (Never felt so good)
It never felt so good
Never felt so good

Alright that's fine
