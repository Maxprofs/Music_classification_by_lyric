                        I'm Gonna Make A Change, 
For Once In My Life 
It's Gonna Feel Real Good, 
Gonna Make A Difference 
Gonna Make It Right . . . 

As I, Turn Up The Collar On My 
Favorite Winter Coat 
This Wind Is Blowin' My Mind 
I See The Kids In The Street, 
With Not Enough To Eat 
Who Am I, To Be Blind? 
Pretending Not To See 
Their Needs 
A Summer's Disregard, 
A Broken Bottle Top 
And A One Man's Soul 
They Follow Each Other On 
The Wind Ya' Know 
'Cause They Got Nowhere 
To Go 
That's Why I Want You To 
Know 

I'm Starting With The Man In 
The Mirror 
I'm Asking Him To Change 
His Ways 
And No Message Could Have 
Been Any Clearer 
If You Wanna Make The World 
A Better Place 
(If You Wanna Make The 
World A Better Place) 
Take A Look At Yourself, And 
Then Make A Change 
(Take A Look At Yourself, And 
Then Make A Change) 
(Na Na Na, Na Na Na, Na Na, 
Na Nah) 

I've Been A Victim Of A Selfish 
Kind Of Love 
It's Time That I Realize 
That There Are Some With No 
Home, Not A Nickel To Loan 
Could It Be Really Me, 
Pretending That They're Not 
Alone? 

A Willow Deeply Scarred, 
Somebody's Broken Heart 
And A Washed-Out Dream 
(Washed-Out Dream) 
They Follow The Pattern Of 
The Wind, Ya' See 
Cause They Got No Place 
To Be 
That's Why I'm Starting With 
Me 
(Starting With Me!) 

I'm Starting With The Man In 
The Mirror 
(Ooh!) 
I'm Asking Him To Change 
His Ways 
(Ooh!) 
And No Message Could Have 
Been Any Clearer 
If You Wanna Make The World 
A Better Place 
(If You Wanna Make The 
World A Better Place) 
Take A Look At Yourself And 
Then Make A Change 
(Take A Look At Yourself And 
Then Make A Change) 

I'm Starting With The Man In 
The Mirror 
(Ooh!) 
I'
