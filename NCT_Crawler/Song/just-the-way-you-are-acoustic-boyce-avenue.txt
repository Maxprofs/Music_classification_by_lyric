                        Bài hát: Just The Way You Are (Acoustic) - Boyce Avenue

Oh her eyes, her eyes, make the stars look like they're not shining
Her hair, her hair, falls perfectly without her trying
She's so beautiful, and I tell her every day

Yeah, I know, I know when I compliment her she won't believe me
And it's so, it's so sad to think she don't see what I see
But every time she asks me do I look okay, I say

Chorus:
When I see your face, there's not a thing that I would change
Cause you're amazing, just the way you are
And when you smile, the whole world stops and stares for awhile
Cause girl you're amazing, just the way you are,

Verse 2:
Her laugh, her laugh; She hates but I think it's so sexy.
She's so beautiful, And I tell her every day.

Oh you know, you know, you know I'd never ask you to change.
If perfect's what you're searching for, Then just stay the same.

So, don't even bother asking, If you look okay;
You know I say

Chorus:
When I see your face, there's not a thing that I would change
Cause you're amazing, just the way you are
And when you smile, the whole world stops and stares for awhile
Cause girl you're amazing, just the way you are,

The way you are
The way you are
Girl you're amazing
Just the way you are

The way you are
The way you are
Girl you're amazing
Just the way you are
