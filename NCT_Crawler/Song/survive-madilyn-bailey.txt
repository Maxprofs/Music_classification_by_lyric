                        Bài hát: Survive - Madilyn Bailey

All the way down, finding my way around
Stars at night to cover me
Back and forth, searching for my way north
Unbroken ground, I'm wandering

Love is around, love is around, baby
Tryna' get out, tryna' be found and maybe,
I've got to get lost to get where I'm going

Like roses, we're only here for a moment
Ashes to ashes
Mountains will always need to be climbed,
But we only got one foot at a time
Our voices, tryna' be more than just noises
Echo to echo
Nobody gets to leave here alive,
Don't just survive (don't just survive)

Heaven and hell, dancing inside myself
Music plays like a symphony
Ebb and flow, battles they come and go
There's calm inside the catastrophe

Love is around, love is around, baby
Tryna' get out, tryna' be found and maybe,
I've got to get lost to get where I'm going

Like roses, we're only here for a moment
Ashes to ashes
Mountains will always need to be climbed,
But we only got one foot at a time
Our voices, tryna' be more than just noises
Echo to echo
Nobody gets to leave here alive,
Don't just survive (don't just survive)
Nobody gets to leave here alive,
Don't just survive (don't just survive)

Like roses
