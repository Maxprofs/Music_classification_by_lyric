                        Baby, if we leave the clubbin', won't be nothing but the lovin'
 'Cause I got a warm bed, I got a warm bed
 Baby, if we leave the clubbin', won't be nothing but the lovin'
 'Cause I got a warm bed, I got a warm bed Dam it's hot, floor is locked
 Can't believe all that ass that you got
 Talkin' slick girl, might get you got
 If you do that again, then I'ma have to arrest you You telling me don't stop
 You must not understand why they calling me Foxx
 And how long I can stay in the box
 I already know how I plan to possess you Kiss you right below your naval then
 Rub you in oil, bite on your ear
 'Til you stand up, make you turn around and touch your toes
 The next thing, girl, you already know Baby, if we leave the clubbin', won't be nothing but the lovin'
 'Cause I got a warm bed, I got a warm bed
 Baby, if we leave the clubbin', won't be nothing but the lovin'
 'Cause I got a warm bed, I got a warm bed Better yet, enough of the talking
 'Cause the Patron says it's time to get it poppin'
 Bartender, swipe the black card, I'm walking
 'Cause she wanna do something like the girls in the film do She wanna to see if the Oscar
 Was the fluke or is Jamie really proper
 Guaranteed I can tell that I got one
 It's just waiting on the camera to start rolling and let you Kiss you right below your naval then
 Rub you in oil, bite on your ear
 'Til you stand up, make you turn around and touch your toes
 The next thing, girl, you already know Baby, if we leave the clubbin', won't be nothing but the lovin'
 'Cause I got a warm bed, I got a warm bed
 Baby, if we leave the clubbin', won't be nothing but the lovin'
 'Cause I got a warm bed, I got a warm bed What would you do if I take your clothes off?
 What would you do if I make you get down?
 What would you do, would be you afraid, girl?
 Then what would you do? Turnin' my bed on What would you do if I kiss you right there?
 What would you do if I keep it right there?
 What would you do if I keep it right there?
 Next thing, girl, you already know Baby, if we leave the clubbin', won't be nothing but the lovin'
 'Cause I got a warm bed, I got a warm bed
 Baby, if we leave the clubbin', won't be nothing but the lovin'
 'Cause I got a warm bed, I got a warm bed Baby, if we leave the clubbin', won't be nothing but the lovin'
 'Cause I got a warm bed, I got a warm bed
 Baby, if we leave the clubbin', won't be nothing but the lovin'
 'Cause I got a warm bed, I got a warm bed
