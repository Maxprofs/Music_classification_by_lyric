                        Ooh, baby, I'm going crazy
 Every time I think of you
 I'm excited, so delighted
 To finally see the light shine through
 I can see a million dreams come true So hold on, here we go
 I've got a feeling that it's gonna grow
 Up to the top of the world Here I am, there you are
 I've got a feeling that we're going far
 Up to the top of the world Ooh, gotta go higher, higher Now the world seems like a sweet dream
 When I look into your eyes
 It's mystifying, there's no denying
 The way you make me feel inside
 And it's getting stronger all the time So hold on, here we go
 I've got a feeling that we're gonna grow
 Up to the top of the world Here I am, there you are
 I've got a feeling that we're going far
 Up to the top of the world Ooh, let me go higher, higher So hold on, here we go
 I've got a feeling that it's gonna grow
 Up to the top of the world Here I am, there you are
 I've got a feeling that we're going far
 Up to the top of the world So hold on, here we go
 I've got a feeling that it's gonna grow
 Up to the top of the world Here I am, there you are
 I've got a feeling that we're going far
 Up to the top of the world
