                        Bài hát: Hold On - Chord Overstreet

Loving and fighting
Accusing
Denying
I can't imagine a world with you gone
The joy and the chaos
The Demons we're made of
I'd be so lost If you left me alone
You locked yourself in the bathroom
Lying on the floor When i break through
I pull you in to feel your heartbeat
Can you hear me screaming
Please don't leave me
Hold on I still want you
Comeback I still need you
Let me take your hand
I'll make it right
I swear to love you all my life
Hold on I still need you
Long endless highway
You are silent beside me
Driving a nightmare I can't escape from
Helplessly praying
The light isn't fading
Hiding the shock and chill in my bones
They took you away on a table
I pace back and forth as you lay still
They pull you in to feel your heartbeat
Can you hear me screaming
Please don't leave me
Hold on I still want you
Comeback I still need you
Let me take your hand
I'll make it right
I swear to love you all my life
Hold on I still need you
I don't wanna let go
I know i'm not that strong
I just wanna hear you
Saying baby
Let's go home
Let's go home
I just wanna take you home
Hold on I still want you
Comeback I still need you.
