                        [Intro]
 Bum bum be dum bum bum be dum dum
 Bum bum be dum bum bum be dum dum

 What's wrong with me?
 Why do I feel like this?
 I'm going crazy now

 [Verse 1]
 No more gas in the rig, can't even get it started
 Nothing heard, nothing said, can't even speak about it
 On my life, on my head, don't wanna think about it
 Feels like I'm going insane, yeah

 It's a thief in the night to come and grab you
 It can creep up inside you and consume you
 A disease of the mind, it can control you
 It's too close for comfort

 [Pre-Chorus]
 Put on your brake lights
 You're in the city of wonder
 Ain't gonna play nice
 Watch out you might just go under

 Better think twice
 Your train of thought will be altered
 So if you must falter 
 Be wise

 [Chorus]
 Your mind's in disturbia
 It's like the darkness is light
 Disturbia, am I scaring you tonight?
 Disturbia, ain't used to what you like

 Disturbia, disturbia

 [Verse 2]
 Faded pictures on the wall
 It's like they talking to me
 Disconnecting all the calls 
 The phone don't even ring

 I gotta get out or 
 Figure this *** out
 It's too close for comfort
 Oh

 [Pre-Chorus]
 It's a thief in the night to come and grab you
 It can creep up inside you and consume you
 A disease of the mind it can control you
 I feel like a monster, oh

 Put on your pretty lies
 You're in the city of wonder
 Ain't gonna play nice
 Watch out you might just go under

 Better think twice
 Your train of thought will be altered
 So if you must falter 
 Be wise

 [Chorus]
 Your mind's in disturbia
 It's like the darkness is light
 Disturbia, am I scaring you tonight?
 Disturbia, ain't used to what you like

 Disturbia, disturbia, disturbia

 [Verse 3]
 Release me from this curse I'm in
 Trying to stay tame but I'm struggling
 If you can't go-o-o
 I think I'm gonna ah, ah, ah, ah

 [Pre-Chorus]
 Put on your brake lights
 You're in the city of wonder
 Ain't gonna play nice
 Watch out you might just go under

 Better think twice
 Your train of thought will be altered
 So if you must falter 
 Be wise

 [Chorus]
 Disturbia
 It's like the darkness is light
 Disturbia, am I scaring you tonight?
 Disturbia, ain't used to what you like

 [Outro]
 Disturbia, disturbia
                        
                    |
