                        Bài hát: Watch Me Work - Tinashe

I believe you'll be somebody
Someone I can call the one
You gon be my only only
I can see that you are watchin'
I'm a make you fall in love
Just sit back and watch me work, work, work, daddy
Watch me while I work, work, work
Yeah, now let me do my work, work, work, daddy
Watch me while I work, work, work, daddy

Tell me that you want it
Everyone know it
To be the last nigga, baby come get it
Yeah baby come get it
You know I've been waiting
Wanna feel it, wanna feel it
You know you're taking too long

Body's low, before you know
Good to go
I'm ready now
I'm on the floor
I'm ready, now I'm ready

I believe you'll be somebody
Someone I can call the one
You gon be my only only
I can see that you are watchin'
I'm a make you fall in love
Just sit back and watch me work, work, work, daddy
Watch me while I work, work, work
Yeah, now let me do my work, work, work, daddy
Watch me while I work, work, work, daddy

Tell me that you need it
Only if you mean it
To be the last nigga
Baby forget it
Yeah baby walk with it
You know I've been waiting
If you're sipping then you're sipping
You know you're taking too long

Body's low, before you know
Good to go
I'm ready now
I'm on the floor
I'm ready, now I'm ready

I believe you'll be somebody
Someone I can call the one
You gon be my only only
I can see that you are watchin'
I'm a make you fall in love
Just sit back and watch me work, work, work, daddy
Watch me while I work, work, work
Yeah, now let me do my work, work, work, daddy
Watch me while I work, work, work, daddy

The night is young
Baby baby
But we head it right now
If you're really down
Ready, ready
I can make your whole life right apart

I believe you'll be somebody
Someone I can call the one
You gon be my only only
I can see that you are watchin'
I'm a make you fall in love
Just sit back and watch me work, work, work, daddy
Watch me while I work, work, work
Yeah, now let me do my work, work, work, daddy
Watch me while I work, work, work, daddy
