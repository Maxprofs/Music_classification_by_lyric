I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
Just like the ones I used to know
Where the tree tops glisten
And children listen
To hear sleigh bells in the snow
The snow

I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
With every Christmas card I write
May your days, may your days, may your days be merry and bright
And may all your Christmases be white
Woah woah

Kurt:
I am dreaming of a white Christmas
Just like the ones I used to know
Where the tree tops glisten
And children listen
To hear sleigh bells in the snow
Woah (Blaine: Bow be do be do)

Kurt and Blaine:
I-I-I-I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
With every Christmas card I write (Blaine: Ooh)

Kurt:
May your days, may your days, may your days be merry and bright

Blaine:
Oh let them be bright

Kurt:
And may all your Christmases be white

Blaine:
Oh! Woo! Come on! Ooh yeah! Oh yeah.

Kurt:
White Christmas

Blaine:
Ooh yeah. Woah.

Kurt and Blaine:
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
With every Christmas card I write (Kurt: Yeah, yeah, yeah)
May your days be merry and bright
And may all your Christmases be white

I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
Doom beam doom doom doom doom be do do
