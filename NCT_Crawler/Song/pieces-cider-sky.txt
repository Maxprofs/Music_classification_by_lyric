                        Bài hát: Pieces - Cider Sky

Verse 1:
From head to heart, I never felt the ocean floor to stars. I never been spun like this before. I'm gonna blame it all on you. And this beat,so high. I'm never gonna come back down,but slide.I never felt oh so bold,so shy.So tell me what you wanna do.
Chorus:
I don't ever feel lost when you're holding my hand.All the world can hear us, when I'm holding pieces of you, pieces of me. We fit together perfectly, and I am falling. Now I'm falling for pieces of you.
Verse 2:
The way you hit my heart,I know it's not logical. It's like an arrow shot through the dark, so hard. The colors all fall apart. Say it's impossible how everything feels so magical. You turn up all the lights, it's beautiful. I fall into the moon.
Chorus:
I don't ever feel lost when I'm holding pieces of you, Pieces of me, we fit together perfectly, and I am falling. Now I'm falling.
Bridge:
Follow, follow, follow, and you run to me.
Echo, echo, echo,I know this is meant to be.
Follow, follow, follow, and you run to me.
You run to me. You run to me.

Pieces of you, pieces of me. We fit together perfectly, and I am falling, now I'm falling for pieces of you.
Pieces of me, we fit together perfectly, and I am falling. Now I'm falling.. for pieces of you. For pieces of you.
