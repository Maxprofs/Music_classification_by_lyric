[00:-00.02]
In my room looking for the shockwaves.
And my watch says it’s getting very late now.
Ring the cab mobile’s on the table.
Now i think it’s time we should get moving
Iron out the creases on my diesels.
Grab my shirt left it by the tv.
Let me check, check me in the mirror
Now i think its time we should get moving
So baby can we rock now
I just wanna make you see
Every time we’re moving and grooving (you make me lose my mind)
So tell me can we rock girl
Want them to see you’re my girl.
Every time your body’s close enough to see.
Come move it close.
I wanna know.
Can i buy you a drink (can i buy you a drink)
Come closer now (come closer)
So we can touch.
Your smile just says you wanna.
On my way passing through the high street.
Looking round all i see is hot girls.
Hoping that some of them will be there.
So i think its time we should get moving
So baby can we rock now.
I just wanna make you see.
Every time we’re moving and grooving(you make me lose my mind)
So tell me can we rock girl.
Want them to see you’re my girl.
Every time your body’s close enough to see
Come move it close
I wanna know
Can i buy you a drink can i buy you a drink
Come closer now come closer
So we can touch
Your smile just says you wanna
Hold on let me break this down
I mean hey girl lets get down
Right now let’s fly
Let me take you to the moon now
Baby girl can’t no other do it quite like you, quite like me
And that makes two, two of us, i mean
I wanna get to know you
Don’t cha wanna move a little closer
You know i like your style
Let me take you to the bar
Let me buy you a (buy you a) let me buy you a drink
And maybe later we can touch
For now just hush
Hey yo rnd come sing for me
Lets keep this moving
Come move it close
I wanna know
Can i buy you a drink can i buy you a drink
Come closer now come closer
So we can touch
Your smile just says you wanna x repeat
