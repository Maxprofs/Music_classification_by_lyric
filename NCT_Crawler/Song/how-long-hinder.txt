                        Why'd you go and break what's already broken?
 I try to take a breath but I'm already choking
 How long till this goes away? I try to remember to forget you
 But I break down every time I do
 It's left me less than zero
 Beat down and bruised I can't see him with you Why'd you go and break what's already broken?
 I try to take a breath but I'm already choking
 'Cause everywhere I look, I can see how you hold him
 How long till this goes away? I can't seem to get my heart over you
 'Cause you creep into everything I do
 And now I'm dyin' to know
 How he touches you I can't see him with you Why'd you go and break what's already broken?
 I try to take a breath but I'm already choking
 'Cause everywhere I look, I can see how you hold him
 How long till this goes away? How long till this goes away? She said, she wants to be friends
 I took a big step back
 She said, she said, she said, she's sorry
 With one finger I said, *** that I can tell you're lyin' when your lips move
 'Cause of one lie it's not me it's you
 It's left me less than zero
 Beat down and bruised I can't see him with you Why'd you go and break what's already broken?
 I try to take a breath but I'm already choking
 'Cause everywhere I look, I can see how you hold him
 How long till this goes away? Why'd you go and break what's already broken?
 I try to take a breath but I'm already choking
 'Cause everywhere I look, I can see how you hold him
 How long till this goes away? How long till this goes away? She said she wants to be friends
 I took a big step back
 She said, she said, she said, she's sorry
 With one finger, with one finger, I said, "*** that"
