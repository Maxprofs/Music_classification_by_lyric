                        Bài hát: Enjoy the Ride - Krewella

We're born ready, ready to be free
Chasing every thrill we can see
With our eyes steady, wake into a dream
Aching to be throw in a ring

If nothing comes easy, as long as we breathing
We'll go all the way or go home
We're born ready, wherever its lead
What we have is all we need

Cause if it fast or slow
All i realy know is i'm gonna enjoy the ride
And if it hard or soft before we get off
I'm gonna enjoy the ride, enjoy the ride
Cause if it fast or slow
All i realy know is i'm gonna enjoy the ride
(music)
Cause if it fast or slow
All i realy know is i'm gonna enjoy the ride
And if it hard or soft before we get off
I'm gonna enjoy the ride, enjoy the ride

We're born hungry, hungry for rush
Screaming when they tell us to hush
Hit the ground running, leave them in the dust
Only run with those we can trust

If nothing comes true 
As we fly where it's blue
As we're ready to face the unknow
We're born hungry, we'll never get enough
Cause we only hear this once

Cause if it fast or slow
All i realy know is i'm gonna enjoy the ride
And if it hard or soft before we get off
I'm gonna enjoy the ride, enjoy the ride
Let's do it again
Let's make it tonight
Yeah let's go into the sky
Yeah it's light
And if it fast or slow
All i realy know is i'm gonna enjoy the ride, enjoy the ride

Cause if it fast or slow
All i realy know is i'm gonna enjoy the ride
And if it hard or soft before we get off
I'm gonna enjoy the ride, enjoy the ride
Let's do it again
Let's make it tonight
Yeah let's go into the sky
Yeah it's light
And if it fast or slow
All i realy know is i'm gonna enjoy the ride, enjoy the ride
